among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning and to which i will assign no fictitious #name# there is #one# anciently common to most towns great or small to wit a workhouse and in this workhouse was born on a #day# and date which i need not trouble myself to repeat inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader in this stage of the business at all events the item of mortality whose #name# is prefixed to the #head# of this #chapter#
for a long #time# after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a #matter# of considerable doubt whether the #child# would survive to bear any #name# at all in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared or if they had that being comprised within a couple of pages they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography extant in the literature of any age or country
although i am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being i do mean to say that in this particular instance it was the best #thing# for $oliver_twist$ that could by possibility have occurred
the fact is that there was considerable difficulty in inducing $oliver_twist$ to take upon himself the office of respiration a troublesome practice but #one# which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence and for some #time# he lay gasping on a little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and the next the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter
now if during this brief period $oliver_twist$ had been surrounded by careful grandmothers anxious aunts experienced nurses and #doctor# of profound wisdom he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no #time#
there being nobody by however but a pauper old #woman# who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer and a parish surgeon who did such #matter# by contract $oliver_twist$ and nature fought out the point between them
the result was that after a few struggles $oliver_twist$ breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage a #voice# for a much longer space of #time# than three #minute# and a quarter
as $oliver_twist$ gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead rustled the pale #face# of a young #woman# was raised feebly from the pillow and a faint #voice# imperfectly articulated the #word# let me see the #child# and die
the surgeon had been sitting with his #face# turned towards the #fire# giving the palms of his #hand# a warm and a rub alternately
as the young #woman# spoke he $miss_rose$ and advancing to the #bed# #head# said with more kindness than might have been expected of him oh you must not talk about dying yet
lor bless her #dear# #heart# no interposed the nurse hastily depositing in her #pocket# a green glass bottle the contents of which she had been tasting in a #corner# with evident satisfaction
when she has lived as long as i have #sir# and had thirteen #child# of her own and all on em dead except two and them in the wurkus with me she ll know better than to take on in that #way# bless her #dear# #heart#
lor bless her #dear# #heart# think what it is to be a #mother# there a #dear# young lamb do apparently this consolatory perspective of a #mother# prospects failed in producing its due effect
she imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead passed her #hand# over her #face# gazed wildly round shuddered fell back and died
the patient shook her #head# and stretched out her #hand# towards the #child# the surgeon deposited it in her #arm# they chafed her breast #hand# and temples but the blood had stopped forever
they talked of hope and comfort they had been strangers too long it all over mrs thingummy said the surgeon at last
ah poor #dear# so it is said the nurse picking up the cork of the green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as she stooped to take up the #child#
you neednt #mind# sending up to me if the #child# cries nurse said the surgeon putting on his gloves with great deliberation
he put on his #hat# and pausing by the #bed# #side# on his #way# to the #door# added she was a good looking #girl# too where did she come from
poor #dear# it very likely it will be troublesome give it a little gruel if it is she was brought here last #night# replied the old #woman# by the overseer order
she had walked some distance for her shoes were worn to pieces but where she came from or where she was going to nobody knows
she was found lying in the #street# the surgeon leaned over the body and raised the left #hand# the old story he said shaking his #head# no wedding ring i see
the medical #gentleman# walked away to dinner and the nurse having once more applied herself to the green bottle sat down on a low #chair# before the #fire# and proceeded to dress the infant
wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering he might have been the #child# of a nobleman or a beggar it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society
but now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service he was badged and ticketed and fell into his #place# at once a parish #child# the orphan of a workhouse the humble half starved drudge to be cuffed and buffeted through the world despised by all and pitied by none
if he could have known that he was an orphan left to the tender mercies of church wardens and overseers perhaps he would have cried the louder
ah good #night# what an excellent example of the power of dress young $oliver_twist$ was $oliver_twist$ cried lustily #chapter# ii treats of $oliver_twist$ growth education and board
for the next eight or ten months $oliver_twist$ was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception he was brought up by #hand#
the parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether there was no female then domiciled in the #house# who was in a situation to impart to $oliver_twist$ the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need
the hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities the workhouse authorities replied with humility that there was not
upon this the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved that $oliver_twist$ should be farmed or in other #word# that he should be dispatched to a branch workhouse some three miles off
where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor laws rolled about the floor all #day# without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence halfpenny per small #head# per week
sevenpence halfpenny worth per week is a good round diet for a #child# a great deal may be got for sevenpence halfpenny quite enough to overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable
the elderly female was a #woman# of wisdom and experience she knew what was good for #child# and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself
so she appropriated the greater #part# of the weekly stipend to her own use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them
everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who demonstrated it so well that he had got his own horse down to a straw a #day# and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on #nothing# at all if he had not died four and twenty #hour# before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of #air#
unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care $oliver_twist$ was delivered over a similar result usually attended the operation of her system for at the very #moment# when the #child# had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten either that it sickened from want and cold or fell into the #fire# from neglect or got half smothered by accident in any #one# of which cases the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this
occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish #child# who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead or inadvertently scalded to #death# when there happened to be a washing though the latter accident was very scarce #anything# approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm the jury would take it into their #head# to ask troublesome questions or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance
but these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the #beadle# the former of whom had always opened the body and found #nothing# inside which was very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted which was very self devotional
besides the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the #beadle# the #day# before to say they were going
thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher the #child# were neat and clean to behold when they went and what more would the #people# have
it cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop $oliver_twist$ ninth birthday found him a pale thin #child# somewhat diminutive in stature and decidedly small in circumference
it had had plenty of #room# to expand thanks to the spare diet of the establishment and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth #day# at all
be this as it may however it was his ninth birthday and he was keeping it in the coal cellar with a select party of two other young #gentleman# who after participating with him in a sound thrashing had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry when $mrs_mann$ the good #lady# of the #house# was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of $mr_bumble$ the #beadle# striving to undo the wicket of the garden gate
is that you $mr_bumble$ #sir# said $mrs_mann$ thrusting her #head# out of the #window# in well affected ecstasies of joy
but nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in $oliver_twist$ breast goodness gracious susan take $oliver_twist$ and them two brats upstairs and wash em directly my #heart# alive
now $mr_bumble$ was a fat #man# and a choleric so instead of responding to this open hearted salutation in a kindred spirit he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a #beadle#
$mr_bumble$ how glad i am to see you sure ly lor only think said $mrs_mann$ running out for the three #boy# had been removed by this #time# only think of that
that i should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside on account of them #dear# #child# walk in #sir# walk in pray $mr_bumble$ do #sir#
although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the #heart# of a church warden it by no means mollified the #beadle#
do you think this respectful or proper conduct $mrs_mann$ inquired $mr_bumble$ grasping his cane to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden gate when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans
i sure $mr_bumble$ that i was only a telling #one# or two of the #dear# #child# as is so fond of you that it was you a coming replied $mrs_mann$ with great humility
are you aweer $mrs_mann$ that you are as i may say a porochial delegate and a stipendiary $mr_bumble$ had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance
he had displayed the #one# and vindicated the other he relaxed well well $mrs_mann$ he replied in a calmer tone it may be as you say it may be
$mrs_mann$ ushered the #beadle# into a small parlour with a brick floor placed a seat for him and officiously deposited his cocked #hat# and cane on the #table# before him
$mr_bumble$ wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered glanced complacently at the cocked #hat# and smiled
lead the #way# in $mrs_mann$ for i come on business and have #something# to say yes he smiled #beadle# are but #man# and $mr_bumble$ smiled
now dont you be offended at what i a going to say observed $mrs_mann$ with captivating sweetness you ve had a long walk you know or i wouldnt mention it
now will you take a little drop of somethink $mr_bumble$ not a drop nor a drop said $mr_bumble$ waving his right #hand# in a dignified but placid #manner#
i think you will said $mrs_mann$ who had noticed the tone of the refusal and the gesture that had accompanied it
just a leetle drop with a little cold #water# and a lump of sugar $mr_bumble$ coughed now just a leetle drop said $mrs_mann$ persuasively
why it what i obliged to keep a little of in the #house# to put into the blessed infants daffy when they aint well $mr_bumble$ replied $mrs_mann$ as she opened a #corner# cupboard and took down a bottle and glass
what is it inquired the #beadle# it gin i ll not deceive you mr it gin do you give the #child# daffy $mrs_mann$ inquired $mr_bumble$ following with his #eye# the interesting process of mixing
ah bless em that i do #dear# as it is replied the nurse i couldnt see em suffer before my very #eye# you know #sir#
no said $mr_bumble$ approvingly no you could not you are a humane #woman# $mrs_mann$ here she set down the glass
i shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board $mrs_mann$ he drew it towards him you feel as a #mother# $mrs_mann$
he stirred the gin and #water# i i drink your health with cheerfulness $mrs_mann$ and he swallowed half of it and now about business said the #beadle# taking out a leathern #pocket# #book#
the #child# that was half baptized $oliver_twist$ is nine #year# old to #day# bless him interposed $mrs_mann$ inflaming her left #eye# with the #corner# of her apron
notwithstanding the most superlative and i may say supernat ral exertions on the #part# of this parish said $mr_bumble$ we have never been able to discover who is his father or what was his #mother# settlement #name# or condition
$mrs_mann$ raised her #hand# in astonishment but added after a #moment# reflection how comes he to have any #name# at all then
and notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound which was afterwards increased to twenty pound the #beadle# drew himself up with great pride and said i inwented it
you $mr_bumble$ i $mrs_mann$ we #name# our fondlings in alphabetical order the last was a swubble i named him
i have got #name# ready made to the end of the alphabet and all the #way# through it again when we come to
this was at twist i named him the next #one# comes will be unwin and the next vilkins why you re quite a literary character #sir# said $mrs_mann$
he finished the gin and #water# and added $oliver_twist$ being now too old to remain here the board have determined to have him back into the #house#
well well said the #beadle# evidently gratified with the compliment perhaps i may be perhaps i may be $mrs_mann$ i have come out myself to take him there
$oliver_twist$ having had by this #time# as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his #face# and #hand# removed as could be scrubbed off in #one# washing was led into the #room# by his benevolent protectress
so let me see him at once i ll fetch him directly said $mrs_mann$ leaving the #room# for that purpose make a bow to the #gentleman# $oliver_twist$ said $mrs_mann$
$oliver_twist$ made a bow which was divided between the #beadle# on the #chair# and the cocked #hat# on the #table#
$oliver_twist$ was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness when glancing upward he caught sight of $mrs_mann$ who had got behind the #beadle# #chair# and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance
he took the hint at once for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection
will you go along with me $oliver_twist$ said $mr_bumble$ in a majestic #voice# will she go with me inquired poor $oliver_twist$
no she cant replied $mr_bumble$ but she ll come and see you sometimes this was no very great consolation to the #child#
young as he was however he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away it was no very difficult #matter# for the #boy# to call #tear# into his #eye#
$mrs_mann$ gave him a thousand embraces and what $oliver_twist$ wanted a great deal more a piece of bread and butter less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse
with the slice of bread in his #hand# and the little brown cloth parish cap on his #head# $oliver_twist$ was then led away by $mr_bumble$ from the wretched home where #one# kind #word# or #look# had never lighted the gloom of his infant #year#
hunger and recent ill usage are great assistants if you want to cry and $oliver_twist$ cried very naturally indeed and yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the cottage gate closed after him
wretched as were the little #companion# in misery he was leaving behind they were the only #friend# he had ever known and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world sank into the #child# #heart# for the first #time#
$mr_bumble$ walked on with long strides little $oliver_twist$ firmly grasping his gold laced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there
to these interrogations $mr_bumble$ returned very brief and snappish replies for the temporary blandness which gin and #water# awakens in some bosoms had by this #time# evaporated and he was once again a #beadle#
$oliver_twist$ had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an #hour# and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread when $mr_bumble$ who had handed him over to the care of an old #woman# returned and telling him it was a board #night# informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith
not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was $oliver_twist$ was rather astounded by this intelligence and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry
he had no #time# to think about the #matter# however for $mr_bumble$ gave him a tap on the #head# with his cane to wake him up and another on the back to make him lively and bidding him to follow conducted him into a large white washed #room# where eight or ten fat #gentleman# were sitting round a #table#
at the top of the #table# seated in an #arm# #chair# rather higher than the rest was a particularly fat #gentleman# with a very round red #face#
$oliver_twist$ brushed away two or three #tear# that were lingering in his #eye# and seeing no board but the #table# fortunately bowed to that
$oliver_twist$ was frightened at the sight of so many #gentleman# which made him tremble and the #beadle# gave him another tap behind which made him cry
these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating #voice# whereupon a #gentleman# in a white waistcoat said he was a fool
bow to the board said $mr_bumble$ what your #name# #boy# said the #gentleman# in the high #chair# which was a capital #way# of raising his spirits and putting him quite at his ease
#boy# said the #gentleman# in the high #chair# listen to me you know you re an orphan i suppose what that #sir# inquired poor $oliver_twist$
the #boy# is a fool i #thought# he was said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat hush said the #gentleman# who had spoken first
you know you ve got no father or #mother# and that you were brought up by the parish dont you yes #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ weeping bitterly
what are you crying for inquired the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat and to be sure it was very extraordinary what could the #boy# be crying for
i hope you say your prayers every #night# said another #gentleman# in a gruff #voice# and pray for the #people# who feed you and take care of you like a christian
it would have been very like a christian and a marvellously good christian too if $oliver_twist$ had prayed for the #people# who fed and took care of him
yes #sir# stammered the #boy# the #gentleman# who spoke last was unconsciously right but he hadnt because nobody had taught him
you have come here to be educated and taught a useful trade said the red faced #gentleman# in the high #chair#
for the combination of both these blessings in the #one# simple process of picking oakum $oliver_twist$ bowed low by the direction of the #beadle# and was then hurried away to a large ward where on a rough hard #bed# he sobbed himself to sleep
well so you ll begin to pick oakum to morrow #morning# at six clock added the surly #one# in the white waistcoat what a novel illustration of the tender laws of england
he little #thought# as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him that the board had that very #day# arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes
and this was it the members of this board were very sage deep philosophical #man# and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse they found out at once what ordinary folks would never have discovered the poor #people# liked it
it was a regular #place# of public entertainment for the poorer classes a tavern where there was #nothing# to pay a public breakfast dinner tea and supper all the #year# round a brick and mortar elysium where it was all play and no work
oho said the board looking very knowing we are the fellows to set this to rights we ll stop it all in no #time#
so they established the rule that all poor #people# should have the alternative for they would compel nobody not they of being starved by a gradual process in the #house# or by a quick #one# out of it
with this view they contracted with the #water# works to lay on an unlimited supply of #water# and with a corn factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal and issued three meals of thin gruel a #day# with an onion twice a week and half a roll of sundays
they made a great many other wise and humane regulations having reference to the #lady# which it is not necessary to repeat kindly undertook to divorce poor married #people# in consequence of the great expense of a suit in #doctor# commons and instead of compelling a #man# to support his family as they had theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a bachelor
there is no saying how many applicants for relief under these last two #head# might have started up in all classes of society if it had not been coupled with the workhouse but the board were long headed #man# and had provided for this difficulty
they let the paupers go to sleep poor $oliver_twist$ but they had the relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel and that frightened #people#
it was rather expensive at first in consequence of the increase in the undertaker $bill_sikes$ and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their wasted shrunken forms after a week or two gruel
for the first six months after $oliver_twist$ was removed the system was in full operation but the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers and the board were in ecstasies
the #room# in which the #boy# were fed was a large stone hall with a copper at #one# end out of which the #master# dressed in an apron for the purpose and assisted by #one# or two #woman# ladled the gruel at mealtimes
of this festive composition each #boy# had #one# porringer and no more except on occasions of great public rejoicing when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides
the #boy# polished them with their spoons till they shone again and when they had performed this operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager #eye# as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon
$oliver_twist$ and his #companion# suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger that #one# #boy# who was tall for his age and hadnt been used to that sort of #thing# for his father had kept a small cook shop hinted darkly to his #companion# that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he might some #night# happen to eat the #boy# who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age
the bowls never wanted washing #boy# have generally excellent appetites he had a wild hungry #eye# and they implicitly believed him
a council was held lots were cast who should walk up to the #master# after supper that evening and ask for more and it fell to $oliver_twist$
the #master# in his cook uniform stationed himself at the copper his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him the gruel was served out and a long grace was said over the short commons
the evening arrived the #boy# took their #place# the gruel disappeared the #boy# whispered each other and winked at $oliver_twist$ while his next neighbors nudged him
he $miss_rose$ from the #table# and advancing to the #master# basin and spoon in #hand# said somewhat alarmed at his own temerity please #sir# i want some more
#child# as he was he was desperate with hunger and reckless with misery the #master# was a fat healthy #man# but he turned very pale
he gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then clung for support to the copper the assistants were paralysed with wonder the #boy# with fear
the #master# aimed a blow at $oliver_twist$ #head# with the ladle pinioned him in his #arm# and shrieked aloud for the #beadle#
the board were sitting in solemn conclave when $mr_bumble$ rushed into the #room# in great excitement and addressing the #gentleman# in the high #chair# said $mr_limbkins$ i beg your pardon #sir#
what said the #master# at #length# in a faint #voice# please #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ i want some more $oliver_twist$ has asked for more
there was a general start horror was depicted on every countenance for more said $mr_limbkins$ compose yourself $mr_bumble$ and answer me distinctly
do i understand that he asked for more after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary he did #sir# replied $mr_bumble$
that #boy# will be hung said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat i know that #boy# will be hung nobody controverted the prophetic #gentleman# opinion
$oliver_twist$ was ordered into instant confinement and a $bill_sikes$ was next #morning# pasted on the outside of the gate offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take $oliver_twist$ off the #hand# of the parish
in other #word# five pounds and $oliver_twist$ were offered to any #man# or #woman# who wanted an apprentice to any trade business or calling
i never was more convinced of #anything# in my #life# said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat as he knocked at the gate and read the $bill_sikes$ next #morning# i never was more convinced of #anything# in my #life# than i am that that #boy# will come to be hung
as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated #gentleman# was right or not i should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative supposing it to possess any at all if i ventured to hint just yet whether the #life# of $oliver_twist$ had this violent termination or no
an animated discussion took #place# #chapter# iii relates how $oliver_twist$ was very near getting a #place# which would not have been
for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more $oliver_twist$ remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary #room# to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board
it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat he would have established that sage individual prophetic character once and for ever by tying #one# end of his #pocket# handkerchief to a hook in the wall and attaching himself to the other
to the performance of this feat however there was #one# obstacle namely that #pocket# handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for all future #time# and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board in council assembled solemnly given and pronounced under their #hand# and seals
he only cried bitterly all #day# and when the long dismal #night# came on spread his little #hand# before his #eye# to shut out the darkness and crouching in the #corner# tried to sleep ever and anon waking with a start and tremble and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him
let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the period of his solitary incarceration $oliver_twist$ was denied the benefit of exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious consolation
as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every #morning# under the pump in a stone yard in the presence of $mr_bumble$ who prevented his catching cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated applications of the cane
as for society he was carried every other #day# into the hall where the #boy# dined and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example
and so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer #time# and there permitted to listen to and console his #mind# with a general supplication of the #boy# containing a special clause therein inserted by authority of the board in which they entreated to be made good virtuous contented and obedient and to be guarded from the sins and vices of $oliver_twist$ whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness and an article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself
it chanced #one# #morning# while $oliver_twist$ affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state that $mr_gamfield$ chimney sweep went his #way# down the high #street# deeply cogitating in his #mind# his #way# and means of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become rather pressing
$mr_gamfield$ most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his #eye# encountered the $bill_sikes$ on the gate
the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction wondering probably whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden so without noticing the #word# of command he jogged onward
$mr_gamfield$ growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but more particularly on his #eye# and running after him bestowed a blow on his #head# which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey
then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp wrench by #way# of gentle reminder that he was not his own #master# and by these means turned him round
a sinecure there was a still greater obstacle in $oliver_twist$ youth and childishness wo said $mr_gamfield$ to the donkey he then gave him another blow on the #head# just to stun him till he came back again
the #gentleman# with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his #hand# behind him after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board #room#
having witnessed the little dispute between $mr_gamfield$ and the donkey he smiled joyously when that #person# came up to read the $bill_sikes$ for he saw at once that $mr_gamfield$ was exactly the sort of #master# $oliver_twist$ wanted
$mr_gamfield$ smiled too as he perused the document for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for and as to the #boy# with which it was encumbered $mr_gamfield$ knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very #thing# for register stoves
so he spelt the $bill_sikes$ through again from beginning to end and then touching his fur cap in token of humility accosted the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat
having completed these arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the $bill_sikes$ this here #boy# #sir# wot the parish wants to prentis said $mr_gamfield$
what of him if the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a good spectable chimbley sweepin bisness said $mr_gamfield$ i wants a prentis and i am ready to take him
ay my #man# said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat with a condescending smile walk in said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat
$mr_gamfield$ having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the #head# and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his absence followed the #gentleman# with the white waistcoat into the #room# where $oliver_twist$ had first seen him
it a nasty trade said $mr_limbkins$ when $mr_gamfield$ had again stated his wish young #boy# have been smothered in chimneys before now said another #gentleman#
they lit it in the chimbley to make em come down again said $mr_gamfield$ that all smoke and no blaze vereas smoke aint no use at all in making a #boy# come down for it only sinds him to sleep and that wot he likes
#boy# is wery obstinit and wery lazy gen #man# and there nothink like a good hot blaze to make em come down vith a run
it humane too gen #man# acause even if they ve stuck in the chimbley roasting their #foot# makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves
the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation but his mirth was speedily checked by a #look# from $mr_limbkins$
the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few #minute# but in so low a tone that the #word# saving of expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report published were alone audible
that acause they damped the straw afore these only chanced to be heard indeed or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis
at #length# the whispering ceased and the members of the board having resumed their seats and their solemnity $mr_limbkins$ said we have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it not at all said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat
as $mr_gamfield$ did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four #boy# to #death# already it occurred to him that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into their #head# that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings
it was very unlike their general mode of doing business if they had but still as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour he twisted his cap in his #hand# and walked slowly from the #table#
decidedly not added the other members so you wont let me have him gen #man# said $mr_gamfield$ pausing near the #door#
no replied $mr_limbkins$ at least as it a nasty business we think you ought to take #something# less than the premium we offered
$mr_gamfield$ countenance brightened as with a quick step he returned to the #table# and said what ll you give gen #man# come
dont be too hard on a poor #man# what ll you give i should say three pound ten was plenty said $mr_limbkins$
ten shillings too much said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat come said $mr_gamfield$ say four pound gen #man# say four pound and you ve got rid of him for good and all
there three pound ten repeated $mr_limbkins$ firmly come i ll split the diff erence gen #man# urged $mr_gamfield$ three pound fifteen
not a farthing more was the firm reply of $mr_limbkins$ you re desperate hard upon me gen #man# said $mr_gamfield$ wavering
pooh pooh nonsense said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat he be cheap with #nothing# at all as a premium
he wants the stick now and then it ll do him good and his board neednt come very expensive for he hasnt been overfed since he was born
$mr_gamfield$ gave an arch #look# at the #face# round the #table# and observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself
$mr_bumble$ was at once instructed that $oliver_twist$ and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for signature and approval that very afternoon
in pursuance of this determination little $oliver_twist$ to his excessive astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt
he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance when $mr_bumble$ brought him with his own #hand# a basin of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread
at this tremendous sight $oliver_twist$ began to cry very piteously thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that #way#
dont make your #eye# red $oliver_twist$ but eat your food and be thankful said $mr_bumble$ in a tone of impressive pomposity
take him you silly fellow he just the #boy# for you ha ha ha the bargain was made you re a going to be made a prentice of $oliver_twist$
the kind and blessed #gentleman# which is so many parents to you $oliver_twist$ when you have none of your own are a going to prentice you and to set you up in #life# and make a #man# of you although the expense to the parish is three pound ten three pound ten
a prentice #sir# said the #child# trembling yes $oliver_twist$ said $mr_bumble$ $oliver_twist$ seventy shillins #one# hundred and forty sixpences and all for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love
as $mr_bumble$ paused to take breath after delivering this address in an awful #voice# the #tear# rolled down the poor #child# #face# and he sobbed bitterly
come said $mr_bumble$ somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced come $oliver_twist$
wipe your #eye# with the cuffs of your jacket and dont cry into your gruel that a very foolish action $oliver_twist$
on their #way# to the magistrate $mr_bumble$ instructed $oliver_twist$ that all he would have to do would be to #look# very happy and say when the #gentleman# asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like it very much indeed both of which injunctions $oliver_twist$ promised to obey the rather as $mr_bumble$ threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in either particular there was no telling what would be done to him
when they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little #room# by himself and admonished by $mr_bumble$ to stay there until he came back to fetch him
it certainly was for there was quite enough #water# in it already there the #boy# remained with a palpitating #heart# for half an #hour#
at the expiration of which #time# $mr_bumble$ thrust in his #head# unadorned with the cocked #hat# and said aloud now $oliver_twist$ my #dear# come to the #gentleman#
as $mr_bumble$ said this he put on a grim and threatening #look# and added in a low #voice# #mind# what i told you you young rascal
$oliver_twist$ stared innocently in $mr_bumble$ #face# at this somewhat contradictory style of address but that #gentleman# prevented his offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining #room# the #door# of which was open
behind a desk sat two old #gentleman# with powdered #head# #one# of whom was reading the newspaper while the other was perusing with the aid of a pair of tortoise shell spectacles a small piece of parchment which lay before him
$mr_limbkins$ was standing in front of the desk on #one# #side# and $mr_gamfield$ with a partially washed #face# on the other while two or three bluff looking #man# in top boots were lounging about
the old #gentleman# with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the little bit of parchment and there was a short pause after $oliver_twist$ had been stationed by $mr_bumble$ in front of the desk
the old #gentleman# who was reading the newspaper raised his #head# for a #moment# and pulled the other old #gentleman# by the sleeve whereupon the last mentioned old #gentleman# woke up
it was a large #room# with a great #window# this is the #boy# your worship said $mr_bumble$ oh is this the #boy# said the old #gentleman#
this is him #sir# replied $mr_bumble$ bow to the magistrate my #dear# $oliver_twist$ roused himself and made his best obeisance
he had been wondering with his #eye# fixed on the magistrates powder whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their #head# and were boards from thenceforth on that account
he doats on it your worship replied $mr_bumble$ giving $oliver_twist$ a sly pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt
well said the old #gentleman# i suppose he fond of chimney sweeping and he will be a sweep will he inquired the old #gentleman#
and this #man# that to be his #master# you #sir# you ll treat him well and feed him and do all that sort of #thing# will you
if we was to bind him to any other trade to morrow he run away simultaneous your worship replied $mr_bumble$ said the old #gentleman#
you re a rough speaker my #friend# but you #look# an honest open hearted #man# said the old #gentleman# turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for $oliver_twist$ premium whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty
but the magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably be expected to discern what other #people# did
when i says i will i means i will replied $mr_gamfield$ doggedly i hope i am #sir# said $mr_gamfield$ with an ugly leer
i have no doubt you are my #friend# replied the old #gentleman# fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the inkstand
if the inkstand had been where the old #gentleman# #thought# it was he would have dipped his pen into it and signed the indentures and $oliver_twist$ would have been straightway hurried off
but as it chanced to be immediately under his nose it followed as a #matter# of course that he looked all over his desk for it without finding it and happening in the course of his search to #look# straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and terrified #face# of $oliver_twist$ who despite all the admonitory #look# and pinches of $mr_bumble$ was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future #master# with a mingled expression of horror and fear too palpable to be mistaken even by a half blind magistrate
the old #gentleman# stopped laid down his pen and looked from $oliver_twist$ to $mr_limbkins$ who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect
it was the critical #moment# of $oliver_twist$ fate my #boy# said the old #gentleman# you #look# pale and alarmed what is the #matter#
stand a little away from him #beadle# said the other magistrate laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of interest
$oliver_twist$ fell on his knees and clasping his #hand# together prayed that they would order him back to the dark #room# that they would starve him beat him kill him if they pleased rather than send him away with that dreadful #man#
now #boy# tell us what the #matter# dont be afraid well said $mr_bumble$ raising his #hand# and #eye# with most impressive solemnity
well of all the artful and designing orphans that ever i see $oliver_twist$ you are #one# of the most bare facedest hold your tongue #beadle# said the second old #gentleman# when $mr_bumble$ had given vent to this compound adjective
i beg your worship pardon said $mr_bumble$ incredulous of having heard aright did your worship speak to me
yes hold your tongue $mr_bumble$ was stupefied with astonishment a #beadle# ordered to hold his tongue a moral revolution the old #gentleman# in the tortoise shell spectacles looked at his #companion# he nodded significantly
i hope stammered $mr_limbkins$ i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a #child#
we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old #gentleman# tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the #matter# said the second old #gentleman# sharply
that same evening the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed not only that $oliver_twist$ would be hung but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain
$mr_bumble$ shook his #head# with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good whereunto $mr_gamfield$ replied that he wished he might come to him which although he agreed with the #beadle# in most #matter# would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description
the next #morning# the public were once informed that $oliver_twist$ was again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him
take the #boy# back to the workhouse and treat him kindly he seems to want it #chapter# iv $oliver_twist$ being offered another #place# makes his first entry into public #life#
in great families when an advantageous #place# cannot be obtained either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the young #man# who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to sea
the board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off $oliver_twist$ in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port
this suggested itself as the very best #thing# that could possibly be done with him the probability being that the skipper would flog him to #death# in a playful mood some #day# after dinner or would knock his brains out with an iron bar both pastimes being as is pretty generally known very favourite and common recreations among #gentleman# of that class
the more the case presented itself to the board in this point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared so they came to the conclusion that the only #way# of providing for $oliver_twist$ effectually was to send him to sea without delay
$mr_bumble$ had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin #boy# without any #friend# and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission when he encountered at the gate no less a #person# than $mr_sowerberry$ the parochial undertaker
$mr_sowerberry$ was a tall gaunt large jointed #man# attired in a suit of threadbare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour and shoes to answer
his features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity
his step was elastic and his #face# betokened inward pleasantry as he advanced to $mr_bumble$ and shook him cordially by the #hand#
you ll make your fortune $mr_sowerberry$ said the #beadle# as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff box of the undertaker which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin
i say you ll make your fortune $mr_sowerberry$ repeated $mr_bumble$ tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly #manner# with his cane
i have taken the measure of the two #woman# that died last #night# $mr_bumble$ said the undertaker think so said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event
so are the coffins replied the #beadle# with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in
$mr_sowerberry$ was much tickled at this as of course he ought to be and laughed a long #time# without cessation
well well $mr_bumble$ he said at #length# there no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are #something# narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit $mr_bumble$
the prices allowed by the board are very small $mr_bumble$ well seasoned timber is an expensive article #sir# and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham
of course of course replied the undertaker and if i dont get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the long run you see
well well said $mr_bumble$ every trade has its drawbacks a fair profit is of course allowable he he he
though i must say continued the undertaker resuming the current of observations which the #beadle# had interrupted though i must say $mr_bumble$ that i have to contend against #one# very great disadvantage which is that all the stout #people# go off the quickest
the #people# who have been better off and have paid rates for many #year# are the first to sink when they come into the #house# and let me tell you $mr_bumble$ that three or four inches over #one# calculation makes a great hole in #one# profits especially when #one# has a family to provide for #sir#
as $mr_sowerberry$ said this with the becoming indignation of an ill used #man# and as $mr_bumble$ felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish the latter #gentleman# #thought# it advisable to change the subject
just so said $mr_bumble$ $oliver_twist$ being uppermost in his #mind# he made him his theme by the bye said $mr_bumble$ you dont know anybody who wants a #boy# do you
a porochial prentis who is at present a dead weight a millstone as i may say round the porochial throat liberal terms $mr_sowerberry$ liberal terms
as $mr_bumble$ spoke he raised his cane to the $bill_sikes$ above him and gave three distinct raps upon the #word# five pounds which were printed thereon in roman capitals of gigantic size
gadso said the undertaker taking $mr_bumble$ by the gilt edged lappel of his official coat that just the very #thing# i wanted to speak to you about
yes i think it rather pretty said the #beadle# glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat
you know #dear# me what a very elegant button this is $mr_bumble$ i never noticed it before the die is the same as the porochial seal the good samaritan healing the sick and bruised #man#
i put it on i remember for the first #time# to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight
the jury brought it in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of #life# didnt they
the board presented it to me on newyear #morning# $mr_sowerberry$ i recollect said the undertaker $mr_bumble$ nodded
and they made it a special verdict i think said the undertaker by adding some #word# to the effect that if the relieving officer had
tush foolery interposed the #beadle# if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk they have enough to do
juries said $mr_bumble$ grasping his cane tightly as was his wont when working into a passion juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches
very true said the undertaker they would indeed so they are said the undertaker they havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that said the #beadle# snapping his fingers contemptuously
no more they have acquiesced the undertaker i despise em said the #beadle# growing very red in the #face#
and i only wish we a jury of the independent sort in the #house# for a week or two said the #beadle# the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for em
so do i rejoined the undertaker let em alone for that replied the undertaker so saying he smiled approvingly to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer
$mr_bumble$ lifted off his cocked #hat# took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered fixed the cocked #hat# on again and turning to the undertaker said in a calmer #voice# well what about the #boy#
oh replied the undertaker why you know $mr_bumble$ i pay a good deal towards the poor rates hem said $mr_bumble$
well well replied the undertaker i was thinking that if i pay so much towards em i ve a right to get as much out of em as i can $mr_bumble$ and so
i think i ll take the #boy# myself $mr_bumble$ grasped the undertaker by the #arm# and led him into the building
$mr_sowerberry$ was closeted with the board for five #minute# and it was arranged that $oliver_twist$ should go to him that evening upon liking a phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that if the #master# find upon a short trial that he can get enough work out of a #boy# without putting too much food into him he shall have him for a term of #year# to do what he likes with
when little $oliver_twist$ was taken before the #gentleman# that evening and informed that he was to go that #night# as general #house# lad to a coffin maker and that if he complained of his situation or ever came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be drowned or knocked on the #head# as the case might be he evinced so little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal and ordered $mr_bumble$ to remove him forthwith
now although it was very natural that the board of all #people# in the world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the #part# of anybody they were rather out in this particular instance
the simple fact was that $oliver_twist$ instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather too much and was in a fair #way# of being reduced for #life# to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received
he heard the news of his destination in perfect #silence# and having had his luggage put into his #hand# which was not very difficult to carry inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel about half a #foot# square by three inches deep he pulled his cap over his #eye# and once more attaching himself to $mr_bumble$ coat cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering
for some #time# $mr_bumble$ drew $oliver_twist$ along without notice or remark for the #beadle# carried his #head# very erect as a #beadle# always should and it being a windy #day# little $oliver_twist$ was completely enshrouded by the skirts of $mr_bumble$ coat as they blew open and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee breeches
as they drew near to their destination however $mr_bumble$ #thought# it expedient to #look# down and see that the #boy# was in good order for inspection by his new #master# which he accordingly did with a fit and becoming #air# of gracious patronage
$oliver_twist$ said $mr_bumble$ yes #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ in a low tremulous #voice# pull that cap off your #eye# and hold up your #head# #sir#
although $oliver_twist$ did as he was desired at once and passed the back of his unoccupied #hand# briskly across his #eye# he left a #tear# in them when he looked up at his conductor
as $mr_bumble$ gazed sternly upon him it rolled down his cheek it was followed by another and another the #child# made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful #one#
withdrawing his other #hand# from $mr_bumble$ he covered his #face# with both and wept until the #tear# sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers
well exclaimed $mr_bumble$ stopping short and darting at his little charge a #look# of intense malignity well of all the ungratefullest and worst disposed #boy# as ever i see $oliver_twist$ you are the
no no #sir# sobbed $oliver_twist$ clinging to the #hand# which held the well known cane no no #sir# i will be good indeed indeed indeed i will #sir#
i am a very little #boy# #sir# and it is so so so what inquired $mr_bumble$ in amazement
so lonely #sir# so very lonely cried the #child# everybody hates me oh #sir# dont dont pray be cross to me
$mr_bumble$ regarded $oliver_twist$ piteous and helpless #look# with some astonishment for a few seconds hemmed three or four #time# in a husky #manner# and after muttering #something# about that troublesome cough bade $oliver_twist$ dry his #eye# and be a good #boy#
the #child# beat his #hand# upon his #heart# and looked in his #companion# #face# with #tear# of real agony then once more taking his #hand# he walked on with him in #silence#
the undertaker who had just put up the shutters of his shop was making some entries in his #day# #book# by the #light# of a most appropriate dismal candle when $mr_bumble$ entered
aha said the undertaker looking up from the #book# and pausing in the middle of a #word# is that you $mr_bumble$
no #one# else $mr_sowerberry$ replied the #beadle# here i ve brought the #boy# $oliver_twist$ made a bow oh
that the #boy# is it said the undertaker raising the candle above his #head# to get a better view of $oliver_twist$
mrs $mr_sowerberry$ emerged from a little #room# behind the shop and presented the form of a short then squeezed up #woman# with a vixenish countenance
mrs $mr_sowerberry$ will you have the goodness to come here a #moment# my #dear# my #dear# said $mr_sowerberry$ deferentially this is the #boy# from the workhouse that i told you of
why he is rather small replied $mr_bumble$ looking at $oliver_twist$ as if it were his fault that he was no bigger he is small
$oliver_twist$ bowed again #dear# me said the undertaker wife he very small there no denying it but he ll grow mrs $mr_sowerberry$ he ll grow
ah i dare say he will replied the #lady# pettishly on our victuals and our drink i see no saving in parish #child# not i for they always cost more to keep than they re worth
with this the undertaker wife opened a #side# #door# and pushed $oliver_twist$ down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark forming the ante #room# to the coal cellar and denominated kitchen wherein sat a slatternly #girl# in shoes down at heel and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair
here $charlotte$ said $mr_sowerberry$ who had followed $oliver_twist$ down give this #boy# some of the cold bits that were put by for trip
however #man# always think they know best there get downstairs little bag bones he hasnt come home since the #morning# so he may go without em
$oliver_twist$ whose #eye# had glistened at the mention of meat and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him
i wish some well fed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall within him whose blood is ice whose #heart# is iron could have seen $oliver_twist$ clutching at the dainty viands that the #dog# had neglected
i wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which $oliver_twist$ tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine
there is only #one# #thing# i should like better and that would be to see the philosopher making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish
well said the undertaker wife when $oliver_twist$ had finished his supper which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful auguries of his future appetite have you done
i dare say the #boy# isnt too dainty to eat em are you #boy# there being #nothing# eatable within his reach $oliver_twist$ replied in the affirmative
then come with me said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ taking up a dim and dirty lamp and leading the #way# upstairs your #bed# under the counter
you dont #mind# sleeping among the coffins i suppose but it doesnt much #matter# whether you do or dont for you cant sleep anywhere else
come dont keep me here all #night# $oliver_twist$ lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress #chapter# $oliver_twist$ mingles with new associates
he forms an unfavourable notion of his #master# business $oliver_twist$ being left to himself in the undertaker shop set the lamp down on a workman bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread which many #people# a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand
an unfinished coffin on black tressels which stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and #death# like that a cold tremble came over him every #time# his #eye# wandered in the direction of the dismal object from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its #head# to drive him mad with terror
against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape looking in the dim #light# like high shouldered ghosts with their #hand# in their breeches #pocket#
coffin plates elm chips bright headed nails and shreds of black cloth lay scattered on the floor and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths on duty at a large private #door# with a hearse drawn by four black steeds approaching in the distance
going to a funeral for the first #time# the shop was close and hot the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins
the recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust looked like a grave nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed $oliver_twist$
he was alone in a strange #place# and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation
the regret of no recent separation was fresh in his #mind# the absence of no loved and well remembered #face# sank heavily into his #heart#
but his #heart# was heavy notwithstanding and he wished as he crept into his narrow #bed# that that were his coffin and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard #ground# with the tall grass waving gently above his #head# and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep
$oliver_twist$ was awakened in the #morning# by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop #door# which before he could huddle on his clothes was repeated in an angry and impetuous #manner# about twenty five #time#
the #boy# had no #friend# to care for or to care for him when he began to undo the chain the legs desisted and a #voice# began
open the #door# will yer cried the #voice# which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the #door# i will directly #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ undoing the chain and turning the key
i suppose yer the new #boy# aint yer said the #voice# through the key hole yes #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ how old are yer inquired the #voice#
then i ll whop yer when i get in said the #voice# you just see if i dont that all my work us brat
$oliver_twist$ had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the #voice# whoever he might be would redeem his pledge most honourably
ten #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ and having made this obliging promise the #voice# began to whistle he drew back the bolts with a trembling #hand# and opened the #door#
for a second or two $oliver_twist$ glanced up the #street# and down the #street# and over the #way# impressed with the belief that the unknown who had addressed him through the key hole had walked a few paces off to warm himself for nobody did he see but a big charity #boy# sitting on a post in front of the #house# eating a slice of bread and butter which he cut into wedges the size of his mouth with a clasp knife and then consumed with great dexterity
i beg your pardon #sir# said $oliver_twist$ at #length# seeing that no other visitor made his appearance did you knock
at this the charity #boy# looked monstrous fierce and said that $oliver_twist$ would want #one# before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that #way#
yer dont know who i am i suppose work us said the charity #boy# in continuation descending from the top of the post meanwhile with edifying gravity
i kicked replied the charity #boy# did you want a coffin #sir# inquired $oliver_twist$ innocently no #sir# rejoined $oliver_twist$ i mister $mr_noah_claypole$ said the charity #boy# and you re under me
with this $mr_noah_claypole$ administered a kick to $oliver_twist$ and entered the shop with a dignified #air# which did him great credit
it is difficult for a large headed small eyed youth of lumbering make and heavy countenance to #look# dignified under any circumstances but it is more especially so when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls
$oliver_twist$ having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first #one# to a small court at the #side# of the #house# in which they were kept during the #day# was graciously assisted by $mr_noah_claypole$ who having consoled him with the assurance that he catch it condescended to help him
take down the shutters yer idle young ruffian $mr_sowerberry$ came down soon after shortly afterwards mrs $mr_sowerberry$ appeared $oliver_twist$ having caught it in fulfilment of $mr_noah_claypole$ prediction followed that young #gentleman# down the stairs to breakfast
come near the #fire# $mr_noah_claypole$ said $charlotte$ i saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from #master# breakfast
$oliver_twist$ shut that #door# at mister $mr_noah_claypole$ back and take them bits that i ve put out on the cover of the bread pan
there your tea take it away to that box and drink it there and make haste for they ll want you to #mind# the shop
d ye hear ye hear work us said $mr_noah_claypole$ lor $mr_noah_claypole$ said $charlotte$ what a rum creature you are why dont you let the #boy# alone let him alone said $mr_noah_claypole$
why everybody lets him alone enough for the #matter# of that neither his father nor his #mother# will ever interfere with him
all his relations let him have his own #way# pretty well eh $charlotte$ he he he oh you queer soul
said $charlotte$ bursting into a hearty laugh in which she was joined by $mr_noah_claypole$ after which they both looked scornfully at poor $oliver_twist$ as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest #corner# of the #room# and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him
no chance #child# was he for he could trace his genealogy all the #way# back to his parents who lived hard by
his #mother# being a washerwoman and his father a drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal pension of twopence halfpenny and an unstateable fraction
the shop #boy# in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding $mr_noah_claypole$ in the public #street# with the ignominious epithets of leathers charity and the like and $mr_noah_claypole$ had bourne them without reply
but now that fortune had cast in his #way# a nameless orphan at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn he retorted on him with interest
it shows us what a beautiful #thing# human nature may be made to be and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity #boy#
$mr_noah_claypole$ was a charity #boy# but not a workhouse orphan this affords charming food for contemplation $oliver_twist$ had been sojourning at the undertaker some three weeks or a month
mr and mrs $mr_sowerberry$ the shop being shut up were taking their supper in the little back parlour when $mr_sowerberry$ after several deferential glances at his wife said my #dear#
he was going to say more but mrs $mr_sowerberry$ looking up with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect he stopped short well said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ sharply
#nothing# my #dear# #nothing# said $mr_sowerberry$ ugh you brute said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ not at all my #dear# said $mr_sowerberry$ humbly
i #thought# you didnt want to hear my #dear# i was only going to say oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed mrs $mr_sowerberry$
i am nobody dont consult me pray i dont want to intrude upon your secrets as mrs $mr_sowerberry$ said this she gave an hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences
but my #dear# said $mr_sowerberry$ i want to ask your advice no no dont ask mine replied mrs $mr_sowerberry$ in an affecting #manner# ask somebody else
here there was another hysterical laugh which frightened $mr_sowerberry$ very much this is a very common and much approved matrimonial course of treatment which is often very effective
it at once reduced $mr_sowerberry$ to begging as a special favour to be allowed to say what mrs $mr_sowerberry$ was most curious to hear
after a short duration the permission was most graciously conceded it only about young twist my #dear# said $mr_sowerberry$
a very good looking #boy# that my #dear# he need be for he eats enough observed the #lady# there an expression of melancholy in his #face# my #dear# resumed $mr_sowerberry$ which is very interesting
he would make a delightful mute my love mrs $mr_sowerberry$ looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment $mr_sowerberry$ remarked it and without allowing #time# for any observation on the good #lady# #part# proceeded
i dont mean a regular mute to attend grown up #people# my #dear# but only for #child# practice it would be very new to have a mute in proportion my #dear#
mrs $mr_sowerberry$ who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking #way# was much struck by the novelty of this idea but as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so under existing circumstances she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband #mind# before
$mr_sowerberry$ rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his proposition it was speedily determined therefore that $oliver_twist$ should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade and with this view that he should accompany his #master# on the very next occasion of his services being required
half an #hour# after breakfast next #morning# $mr_bumble$ entered the shop and supporting his cane against the counter drew forth his large leathern #pocket# #book# from which he selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to $mr_sowerberry$
you may depend upon it it would have a superb effect the occasion was not long in coming aha said the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance an order for a coffin eh
for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards replied $mr_bumble$ fastening the strap of the leathern #pocket# #book# which like himself was very corpulent
bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to $mr_bumble$ i never heard the #name# before $mr_bumble$ shook his #head# as he replied obstinate #people# $mr_sowerberry$ very obstinate
proud too i afraid #sir# proud eh exclaimed $mr_sowerberry$ with a sneer come that too much oh it sickening replied the #beadle#
we only heard of the family the #night# before last said the #beadle# and we shouldnt have known #anything# about them then only a #woman# who lodges in the same #house# made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a #woman# as was very bad
he had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blacking bottle offhand
antimonial $mr_sowerberry$ so it is acquiesced the undertaker ah there promptness said the undertaker promptness indeed replied the #beadle#
why the husband sends back #word# that the medicine wont suit his wife complaint and so she shant take it says she shant take it #sir#
good strong wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish labourers and a coal heaver only a week before sent em for #nothing# with a blackin bottle in and he sends back #word# that she shant take it #sir#
as the atrocity presented itself to $mr_bumble$ #mind# in full force he struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with indignation
but what the consequence what the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels #sir# well said the undertaker i ne ver did never did #sir# ejaculated the #beadle#
no nor nobody never did but now she dead we ve got to bury her and that the direction and the sooner it done the better
thus saying $mr_bumble$ put on his cocked #hat# wrong #side# first in a fever of parochial excitement and flounced out of the shop
why he was so angry $oliver_twist$ that he forgot even to ask after you said $mr_sowerberry$ looking after the #beadle# as he strode down the #street#
yes #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ who had carefully kept himself out of sight during the interview and who was shaking from #head# to #foot# at the mere recollection of the sound of $mr_bumble$ #voice#
he neednt haven taken the trouble to shrink from $mr_bumble$ glance however for that functionary on whom the prediction of the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression #thought# that now the undertaker had got $oliver_twist$ upon trial the subject was better avoided until such #time# as he should be firmly bound for seven #year# and all danger of his being returned upon the #hand# of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome
well said $mr_sowerberry$ taking up his #hat# the sooner this job is done the better $mr_noah_claypole$ #look# after the shop
they walked on for some #time# through the most crowded and densely inhabited #part# of the town and then striking down a narrow #street# more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused to #look# for the #house# which was the object of their search
the #house# on either #side# were high and large but very old and tenanted by #people# of the poorest class as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid #look# of the few #man# and #woman# who with folded #arm# and bodies half doubled occasionally skulked along
a great many of the tenements had shop fronts but these were fast closed and mouldering away only the upper #room# being inhabited
some #house# which had become insecure from age and decay were prevented from falling into the #street# by huge beams of wood reared against the walls and firmly planted in the road but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches for many of the rough boards which supplied the #place# of #door# and #window# were wrenched from their positions to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body
$oliver_twist$ put on your cap and come with me $oliver_twist$ obeyed and followed his #master# on his professional mission the kennel was stagnant and filthy
there was neither knocker nor bell handle at the open #door# where $oliver_twist$ and his #master# stopped so groping his #way# cautiously through the dark passage and bidding $oliver_twist$ keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs
the very rats which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness were hideous with famine stumbling against a #door# on the landing he rapped at it with his knuckles
the undertaker at once saw enough of what the #room# contained to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed
it was opened by a young #girl# of thirteen or fourteen he stepped in $oliver_twist$ followed him there was no #fire# in the #room# but a #man# was crouching mechanically over the empty stove
there were some ragged #child# in another #corner# and in a small recess opposite the #door# there lay upon the #ground# #something# covered with an old blanket
$oliver_twist$ shuddered as he cast his #eye# toward the #place# and crept involuntarily closer to his #master# for though it was covered up the #boy# felt that it was a corpse
an old #woman# too had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth and was sitting beside him the #man# #face# was thin and very pale his hair and beard were grizzly his #eye# were bloodshot
the old #woman# #face# was wrinkled her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip and her #eye# were bright and piercing
$oliver_twist$ was afraid to #look# at either her or the #man# they seemed so like the rats he had seen outside
nobody shall go near her said the #man# starting fiercely up as the undertaker approached the recess keep back damn you keep back if you ve a #life# to lose
i tell you said the #man# clenching his #hand# and stamping furiously on the floor i tell you i wont have her put into the #ground#
nonsense my good #man# said the undertaker who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes nonsense she couldnt rest there
the undertaker offered no reply to this raving but producing a tape from his #pocket# knelt down for a #moment# by the #side# of the body
ah said the #man# bursting into #tear# and sinking on his knees at the #foot# of the dead #woman# kneel down kneel down
the worms would worry her not eat her she is so worn away kneel round her every #one# of you and mark my #word#
i never knew how bad she was till the fever came upon her and then her bones were starting through the skin
i say she was starved to #death# there was neither #fire# nor candle she died in the dark in the dark she couldnt even see her #child# #face# though we heard her gasping out their #name#
when i came back she was dying and all the blood in my #heart# has dried up for they starved her to #death#
i begged for her in the #street# and they sent me to prison i swear it before the god that saw it
he twined his #hand# in his hair and with a loud scream rolled grovelling upon the floor his #eye# fixed and the foam covering his lips
the terrified #child# cried bitterly but the old #woman# who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed menaced them into #silence#
they starved her having unloosened the cravat of the #man# who still remained extended on the #ground# she tottered towards the undertaker
she was my daughter said the old #woman# nodding her #head# in the direction of the corpse and speaking with an idiotic leer more ghastly than even the presence of #death# in such a #place#
well it is strange that i who gave birth to her and was a #woman# then should be alive and merry now and she lying there so cold and stiff
lord lord lord lord to think of it it as good as a play as good as a play as the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment the undertaker turned to go away
stop stop said the old #woman# in a loud whisper will she be buried to morrow or next #day# or to #night#
i laid her out and i must walk you know send me a large cloak a good warm #one# for it is bitter cold
we should have cake and wine too before we go never #mind# send some bread only a loaf of bread and a cup of #water#
shall we have some bread #dear# she said eagerly catching at the undertaker coat as he once more moved towards the #door#
yes yes said the undertaker of course #anything# you like he disengaged himself from the old #woman# grasp and drawing $oliver_twist$ after him hurried away
the next #day# the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half quartern loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by $mr_bumble$ himself
$oliver_twist$ and his #master# returned to the miserable abode where $mr_bumble$ had already arrived accompanied by four #man# from the workhouse who were to act as bearers
an old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old #woman# and the #man# and the bare coffin having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers and carried into the #street#
now you must put your best leg foremost old #lady# whispered $mr_sowerberry$ in the old #woman# ear we are rather late and it wont do to keep the clergyman waiting
thus directed the bearers trotted on under their #light# burden and the two mourners kept as near them as they could
$mr_bumble$ and $mr_sowerberry$ walked at a good smart pace in front and $oliver_twist$ whose legs were not so long as his #master# ran by the #side#
there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as $mr_sowerberry$ had anticipated however for when they reached the obscure #corner# of the churchyard in which the nettles grew and where the parish graves were made the clergyman had not arrived and the clerk who was sitting by the vestry #room# #fire# seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an #hour# or so before he came
so they put the bier on the brink of the grave and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged #boy# whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide and seek among the tombstones or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin
move on my #man# as quick as you like $mr_sowerberry$ and $mr_bumble$ being personal #friend# of the clerk sat by the #fire# with him and read the paper
at #length# after a lapse of #something# more than an #hour# $mr_bumble$ and $mr_sowerberry$ and the clerk were seen running towards the grave
$mr_bumble$ then thrashed a #boy# or two to keep up appearances and the reverend #gentleman# having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four #minute# gave his surplice to the clerk and walked away again
immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared putting on his surplice as he came along now $bill_sikes$ said $mr_sowerberry$ to the grave digger
it was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the uppermost coffin was within a few #foot# of the surface
the grave digger shovelled in the earth stamped it loosely down with his #foot# shouldered his spade and walked off followed by the #boy# who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon
fill up come my good fellow said $mr_bumble$ tapping the #man# on the back they want to shut up the yard
the #man# who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the grave #side# started raised his #head# stared at the #person# who had addressed him walked forward for a few paces and fell down in a swoon
the crazy old #woman# was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any attention so they threw a can of cold #water# over him and when he came to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed on their different #way#
well $oliver_twist$ said $mr_sowerberry$ as they walked home how do you like it pretty well thank you #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ with considerable hesitation
not very much #sir# ah you ll get used to it in #time# $oliver_twist$ said $mr_sowerberry$ #nothing# when you are used to it my #boy#
$oliver_twist$ wondered in his own #mind# whether it had taken a very long #time# to get $mr_sowerberry$ used to it
but he #thought# it better not to ask the question and walked back to the shop thinking over all he had seen and heard
#chapter# vi $oliver_twist$ being goaded by the taunts of $mr_noah_claypole$ rouses into action and rather astonishes him the month trial over $oliver_twist$ was formally apprenticed
in commercial phrase coffins were looking up and in the course of a few weeks $oliver_twist$ acquired a great deal of experience
it was a nice sickly season just at this #time# the success of $mr_sowerberry$ ingenious speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes
the oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent or so fatal to infant existence and many were the mournful processions which little $oliver_twist$ headed in a #hat# band reaching down to his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the #mother# in the town
as $oliver_twist$ accompanied his #master# in most of his adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong minded #people# bear their trials and losses
for instance when $mr_sowerberry$ had an order for the burial of some rich old #lady# or #gentleman# who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need be quite cheerful and contented conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety as if #nothing# whatever had happened to disturb them
wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their #mind# to render it as becoming and attractive as possible
it was observable too that #lady# and #gentleman# who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached home and became quite composed before the tea drinking was over
husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness all this was very pleasant and improving to see and $oliver_twist$ beheld it with great admiration
that $oliver_twist$ was moved to resignation by the example of these good #people# i cannot although i am his biographer undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence but i can most distinctly say that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill treatment of $mr_noah_claypole$ who used him far worse than before now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new #boy# promoted to the black stick and hatband while he the old #one# remained stationary in the muffin cap and leathers
$charlotte$ treated him ill because $mr_noah_claypole$ did and mrs $mr_sowerberry$ was his decided enemy because $mr_sowerberry$ was disposed to be his #friend# so between these three on #one# #side# and a glut of funerals on the other $oliver_twist$ was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shut up by mistake in the grain department of a brewery
and now i come to a very important passage in $oliver_twist$ history for i have to record an act slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings
#one# #day# $oliver_twist$ and $mr_noah_claypole$ had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner #hour# to banquet upon a small joint of mutton a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck when $charlotte$ being called out of the #way# there ensued a brief interval of #time# which $mr_noah_claypole$ being hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young $oliver_twist$
intent upon this innocent amusement $mr_noah_claypole$ put his #foot# on the #table# cloth and pulled $oliver_twist$ hair and twitched his ears and expressed his opinion that he was a sneak and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable event should take #place# and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance like a malicious and ill conditioned charity #boy# as he was
but making $oliver_twist$ cry $mr_noah_claypole$ attempted to be more facetious still and in his attempt did what many sometimes do to this #day# when they want to be funny
he got rather personal work us said $mr_noah_claypole$ how your #mother# she dead replied $oliver_twist$ dont you say #anything# about her to me
$oliver_twist$ colour $miss_rose$ as he said this he breathed quickly and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which $mr_noah_claypole$ #thought# must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying
of a broken #heart# some of our old nurses told me replied $oliver_twist$ more as if he were talking to himself than answering $mr_noah_claypole$
under this impression he returned to the charge what did she die of work us said $mr_noah_claypole$ i think i know what it must be to die of that
tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy work us said $mr_noah_claypole$ as a #tear# rolled down $oliver_twist$ cheek what set you a snivelling now
not you replied $oliver_twist$ sharply there that enough dont say #anything# more to me about her you better not
better not exclaimed $mr_noah_claypole$ well better not work us dont be impudent your #mother# too she was a nice un she was
and here $mr_noah_claypole$ nodded his #head# expressively and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the occasion
yer know work us continued $mr_noah_claypole$ emboldened by $oliver_twist$ #silence# and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity of all tones the most annoying yer know work us it cant be helped now and of course yer couldnt help it then and i am very sorry for it and i sure we all are and pity yer very much
but yer must know work us yer #mother# was a regular right down bad un what did you say inquired $oliver_twist$ looking up very quickly
and it a great deal better work us that she died when she did or else she have been hard labouring in bridewell or transported or hung which is more likely than either isnt it
crimson with fury $oliver_twist$ started up overthrew the #chair# and #table# seized $mr_noah_claypole$ by the throat shook him in the violence of his rage till his teeth chattered in his #head# and collecting his whole force into #one# heavy blow felled him to the #ground#
oh lor a regular right down bad un work us replied $mr_noah_claypole$ coolly a #minute# ago the #boy# had looked the quiet #child# mild dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him
his breast heaved his attitude was erect his #eye# bright and vivid his whole #person# changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his #foot# and defied him with an energy he had never known before
but his spirit was roused at last the cruel insult to his dead #mother# had set his blood on #fire# he ll murder me
$mr_noah_claypole$ shouts were responded to by a loud scream from $charlotte$ and a louder from mrs $mr_sowerberry$ the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a #side# #door# while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human #life# to come further down
blubbered $mr_noah_claypole$ $charlotte$ missis here the new #boy# a murdering of me help help $oliver_twist$ gone mad char lotte oh you little wretch
screamed $charlotte$ seizing $oliver_twist$ with her utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong #man# in particularly good training
and between every syllable $charlotte$ gave $oliver_twist$ a blow with all her might accompanying it with a scream for the benefit of society
$charlotte$ fist was by no means a #light# #one# but lest it should not be effectual in calming $oliver_twist$ wrath mrs $mr_sowerberry$ plunged into the kitchen and assisted to hold him with #one# #hand# while she scratched his #face# with the other
oh you little un grate ful mur de rous hor rid villain in this favourable position of affairs $mr_noah_claypole$ $miss_rose$ from the #ground# and pommelled him behind
when they were all wearied out and could #tear# and beat no longer they dragged $oliver_twist$ struggling and shouting but #nothing# daunted into the dust cellar and there locked him up
this was rather too violent exercise to last long this being done mrs $mr_sowerberry$ sunk into a #chair# and burst into #tear#
$charlotte$ said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ speaking as well as she could through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold #water# which $mr_noah_claypole$ had poured over her #head# and shoulders
bless her she going off said $charlotte$ a glass of #water# $mr_noah_claypole$ #dear# make haste oh oh $charlotte$ what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our #bed#
this ll teach #master# not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle
ah mercy indeed ma am was the reply i only hope poor $mr_noah_claypole$ he was all but killed ma am when i come in
$mr_noah_claypole$ whose top waistcoat button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of $oliver_twist$ #head# rubbed his #eye# with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed some affecting #tear# and sniffs
your #master# not at home there not a #man# in the #house# and he ll kick that #door# down in ten #minute#
poor fellow said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ looking piteously on the charity #boy# what to be done exclaimed mrs $mr_sowerberry$ $oliver_twist$ vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question rendered this occurance highly probable
#dear# dear i dont know ma am said $charlotte$ unless we send for the police officers or the millingtary suggested $mr_noah_claypole$
run to $mr_bumble$ $mr_noah_claypole$ and tell him to come here directly and not to lose a #minute# never #mind# your cap
no no said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ bethinking herself of $oliver_twist$ old #friend# make haste you can hold a knife to that black #eye# as you run along
$mr_noah_claypole$ stopped to make no reply but started off at his fullest speed and very much it astonished the #people# who were out walking to see a charity #boy# tearing through the #street# pell mell with no cap on his #head# and a clasp knife at his #eye#
#chapter# vii $oliver_twist$ continues refractory $mr_noah_claypole$ ran along the #street# at his swiftest pace and paused not once for breath until he reached the workhouse gate
having rested here for a #minute# or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of #tear# and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket and presented such a rueful #face# to the aged pauper who opened it that even he who saw #nothing# but rueful #face# about him at the best of #time# started back in astonishment
it ll keep the swelling down why what the #matter# with the #boy# said the old pauper $mr_bumble$ mr $mr_bumble$
cried $mr_noah_claypole$ with well affected dismay and in tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of $mr_bumble$ himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked #hat# which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance as showing that even a #beadle# acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self possession and forgetfulness of personal dignity
oh $mr_bumble$ #sir# said $mr_noah_claypole$ $oliver_twist$ #sir# $oliver_twist$ has what what interposed $mr_bumble$ with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic #eye#
not run away he hasnt run away has he $mr_noah_claypole$ no #sir# no not run away #sir# but he turned wicious replied $mr_noah_claypole$
he tried to murder me #sir# and then he tried to murder $charlotte$ and then missis oh what dreadful pain it is
and here $mr_noah_claypole$ writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel like positions thereby giving $mr_bumble$ to understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of $oliver_twist$ he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from which he was at that #moment# suffering the acutest torture
when $mr_noah_claypole$ saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed $mr_bumble$ he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten #time# louder than before and when he observed a #gentleman# in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the #gentleman# aforesaid
the #gentleman# notice was very soon attracted for he had not walked three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young cur was howling for and why $mr_bumble$ did not favour him with #something# which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated an involuntary process
it a poor #boy# from the free school #sir# replied $mr_bumble$ who has been nearly murdered all but murdered #sir# by young twist
such agony please #sir# by jove exclaimed the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat stopping short i knew it i felt a strange presentiment from the very first that that audacious young savage would come to be hung
he has likewise attempted #sir# to murder the female servant said $mr_bumble$ with a #face# of ashy paleness and his missis interposed $mr_noah_claypole$
and his #master# too i think you said $mr_noah_claypole$ added $mr_bumble$ no he out or he would have murdered him replied $mr_noah_claypole$
he said he wanted to ah said he wanted to did he my #boy# inquired the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat
and please #sir# missis wants to know whether $mr_bumble$ can spare #time# to step up there directly and flog him cause #master# out
certainly my #boy# certainly said the #gentleman# in the white waistcoat smiling benignly and patting $mr_noah_claypole$ #head# which was about three inches higher than his own
yes #sir# replied $mr_noah_claypole$ you re a good #boy# a very good #boy# here a penny for you $mr_bumble$ just step up to $mr_sowerberry$ with your cane and see what best to be done
and the cocked #hat# and cane having been by this #time# adjusted to their owner satisfaction $mr_bumble$ and $mr_noah_claypole$ betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker shop
dont spare him $mr_bumble$ no i will not #sir# replied the #beadle# here the position of affairs had not at all improved
the accounts of his ferocity as related by mrs $mr_sowerberry$ and $charlotte$ were of so startling a nature that $mr_bumble$ judged it prudent to parley before opening the #door#
with this view he gave a kick at the outside by #way# of prelude and then applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone $oliver_twist$
$mr_sowerberry$ had not yet returned and $oliver_twist$ continued to kick with undiminished vigour at the cellar #door# come you let me out
replied $oliver_twist$ from the inside do you know this here #voice# $oliver_twist$ said $mr_bumble$ yes replied $oliver_twist$
aint you afraid of it #sir# aint you a trembling while i speak #sir# said $mr_bumble$ no replied $oliver_twist$ boldly
an answer so different from the #one# he had expected to elicit and was in the habit of receiving staggered $mr_bumble$ not a little
he stepped back from the keyhole drew himself up to his full height and looked from #one# to another of the three bystanders in mute astonishment
oh you know $mr_bumble$ he must be mad said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ no #boy# in half his senses could venture to speak so to you
it not madness ma am replied $mr_bumble$ after a few #moment# of deep meditation it meat what exclaimed mrs $mr_sowerberry$
you ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him ma am unbecoming a #person# of his condition as the board mrs $mr_sowerberry$ who are practical philosophers will tell you
meat ma am meat replied $mr_bumble$ with stern emphasis you ve over fed him ma am what have paupers to do with soul or spirit
it quite enough that we let em have live bodies if you had kept the #boy# on gruel ma am this would never have happened
the liberality of mrs $mr_sowerberry$ to $oliver_twist$ had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat so there was a great deal of meekness and self devotion in her voluntarily remaining under $mr_bumble$ heavy accusation
#dear# dear ejaculated mrs $mr_sowerberry$ piously raising her #eye# to the kitchen ceiling this comes of being liberal of which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in #thought# #word# or deed
ah said $mr_bumble$ when the #lady# brought her #eye# down to earth again the only #thing# that can be done now that i know of is to leave him in the cellar for a #day# or so till he a little starved down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship
both the nurse and #doctor# said that that #mother# of his made her #way# here against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well disposed #woman# weeks before
at this point of $mr_bumble$ discourse $oliver_twist$ just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his #mother# recommenced kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible
$oliver_twist$ offence having been explained to him with such exaggerations as the #lady# #thought# best calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellar #door# in a twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar
$oliver_twist$ clothes had been torn in the beating he had received his #face# was bruised and scratched and his hair scattered over his forehead
the angry flush had not disappeared however and when he was pulled out of his prison he scowled boldly on $mr_noah_claypole$ and looked quite undismayed
now you are a nice young fellow aint you said $mr_sowerberry$ giving $oliver_twist$ a shake and a box on the ear
he comes of a bad family excitable natures mrs $mr_sowerberry$ sowerberry returned at this juncture he called my #mother# #name# replied $oliver_twist$
well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ she deserved what he said and worse
she didnt said $oliver_twist$ she did said mrs $mr_sowerberry$ it a lie said $oliver_twist$ mrs $mr_sowerberry$ burst into a flood of #tear#
if he had hesitated for #one# instant to punish $oliver_twist$ most severely it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of a #man# and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this #chapter#
to do him justice he was as far as his power went it was not very extensive kindly disposed towards the #boy# perhaps because it was his interest to be so perhaps because his wife disliked him
the flood of #tear# however left him no resource so he at once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even mrs $mr_sowerberry$ herself and rendered $mr_bumble$ subsequent application of the parochial cane rather unnecessary
for the rest of the #day# he was shut up in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of bread and at #night# mrs $mr_sowerberry$ after making various remarks outside the #door# by no means complimentary to the memory of his #mother# looked into the #room# and amidst the jeers and pointings of $mr_noah_claypole$ and $charlotte$ ordered him upstairs to his dismal #bed#
it was not until he was left alone in the #silence# and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker that $oliver_twist$ gave #way# to the feelings which the #day# treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere #child#
this flood of #tear# left $mr_sowerberry$ no alternative he had listened to their taunts with a #look# of contempt he had borne the lash without a cry
for he felt that pride swelling in his #heart# which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they had roasted him alive
but now when there were none to see or hear him he fell upon his knees on the floor and hiding his #face# in his #hand# wept such #tear# as god send for the credit of our nature few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him
for a long #time# $oliver_twist$ remained motionless in this attitude the candle was burning low in the socket when he $miss_rose$ to his #foot#
having gazed cautiously round him and listened intently he gently undid the fastenings of the #door# and looked abroad it was a cold dark #night#
the stars seemed to the #boy# #eye# farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before there was no wind and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the #ground# looked sepulchral and #death# like from being so still
having availed himself of the expiring #light# of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had sat himself down upon a bench to wait for #morning#
with the first ray of #light# that struggled through the crevices in the shutters $oliver_twist$ arose and again unbarred the #door#
he softly reclosed the #door# #one# timid #look# around #one# #moment# pause of hesitation he had closed it behind him and was in the open #street#
he looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly he remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up the hill
he took the same route and arriving at a footpath across the fields which he knew after some distance led out again into the road struck into it and walked quickly on
along this same footpath $oliver_twist$ well remembered he had trotted beside $mr_bumble$ when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm
his #way# lay directly in front of the cottage his #heart# beat quickly when he bethought himself of this and he half resolved to turn back
he had come a long #way# though and should lose a great deal of #time# by doing so besides it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen so he walked on
he reached the #house# there was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early #hour# $oliver_twist$ stopped and peeped into the garden
a #child# was weeding #one# of the little #bed# as he stopped he raised his pale #face# and disclosed the features of #one# of his former #companion#
$oliver_twist$ felt glad to see him before he went for though younger than himself he had been his little #friend# and playmate
said $oliver_twist$ as the #boy# ran to the gate and thrust his thin #arm# between the rails to greet him
they had been beaten and starved and shut up together many and many a #time# hush $dick$ is any #one# up
nobody but me replied the #child# you musnt say you saw me $dick$ said $oliver_twist$ i am running away
they beat and ill use me $dick$ and i am going to seek my fortune some long #way# off i dont know where
how pale you are i heard the #doctor# tell them i was dying replied the #child# with a faint smile
i am very glad to see you #dear# but dont stop dont stop yes yes i will to say good ye to you replied $oliver_twist$
i shall see you again $dick$ i know i shall you will be well and happy i hope so replied the #child#
i know the #doctor# must be right $oliver_twist$ because i dream so much of heaven and angels and kind #face# that i never see when i am awake
after i am dead but not before kiss me said the #child# climbing up the low gate and flinging his little #arm# round $oliver_twist$ neck
the blessing was from a young #child# lips but it was the first that $oliver_twist$ had ever heard invoked upon his #head# and through the struggles and sufferings and troubles and changes of his after #life# he never once forgot it
a strange sort of young #gentleman# $oliver_twist$ reached the stile at which the by path terminated and once more gained the high road
good ye #dear# god bless you #chapter# viii $oliver_twist$ walks to london he encounters on the road it was eight clock now
though he was nearly five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by turns till noon fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken
then he sat down to rest by the #side# of the milestone and began to think for the first #time# where he had better go and try to live
the stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london
the #name# awakened a new train of ideas in the #boy# #mind# london that great #place# nobody not even $mr_bumble$ could ever find him there
he had often heard the old #man# in the workhouse too say that no lad of spirit need want in london and that there were #way# of living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in country #part# had no idea of
it was the very #place# for a homeless #boy# who must die in the #street# unless some #one# helped him as these #thing# passed through his #thought# he jumped upon his #foot# and again walked forward
he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four miles more before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his #place# of destination
as this consideration forced itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his means of getting there
he had a penny too a gift of $mr_sowerberry$ after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well in his #pocket#
a clean shirt #thought# $oliver_twist$ is a very comfortable #thing# and so are two pairs of darned stockings and so is a penny but they are small helps to a sixty five miles walk in winter #time#
but $oliver_twist$ #thought# like those of most other #people# although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them so after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and trudged on
$oliver_twist$ walked twenty miles that #day# and all that #time# tasted #nothing# but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of #water# which he begged at the cottage #door# by the road #side#
when the #night# came he turned into a meadow and creeping close under a hay rick determined to lie there till #morning#
he felt frightened at first for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields and he was cold and hungry and more alone than he had ever felt before
he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and two pairs of stockings in his bundle being very tired with his walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles
he felt cold and stiff when he got up next #morning# and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very first village through which he passed
he had walked no more than twelve miles when #night# closed in again his #foot# were sore and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him
another #night# passed in the bleak damp #air# made him worse when he set forward on his journey next #morning# he could hardly crawl along
he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage coach came up and then begged of the outside passengers but there were very few who took any notice of him and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny
poor $oliver_twist$ tried to keep up with the coach a little #way# but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore #foot#
when the outsides saw this they put their halfpence back into their #pocket# again declaring that he was an idle young #dog# and didnt deserve #anything# and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind
in some villages large painted boards were fixed up warning all #person# who begged within the district that they would be sent to jail
in others he would stand about the inn yards and #look# mournfully at every #one# who passed a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady ordering #one# of the post #boy# who were lounging about to drive that strange #boy# out of the #place# for she was sure he had come to steal #something#
if he begged at a farmer #house# ten to #one# but they threatened to set the #dog# on him and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about the #beadle# which brought $oliver_twist$ #heart# into his mouth very often the only #thing# he had there for many #hour# together
in fact if it had not been for a good hearted turnpike #man# and a benevolent old #lady# $oliver_twist$ troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his #mother# in other #word# he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king highway
but the turnpike #man# gave him a meal of bread and cheese and the old #lady# who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant #part# of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little she could afford and more with such kind and gentle #word# and such #tear# of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into $oliver_twist$ soul than all the sufferings he had ever undergone
early on the seventh #morning# after he had left his native #place# $oliver_twist$ limped slowly into the little town of barnet
this frightened $oliver_twist$ very much and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition the #window# shutters were closed the #street# was empty not a soul had awakened to the business of the #day#
the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty but the #light# only served to show the #boy# his own lonesomeness and desolation as he sat with bleeding #foot# and covered with dust upon a #door# step
some few stopped to gaze at $oliver_twist$ for a #moment# or two or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there
by degrees the shutters were opened the #window# blinds were drawn up and #people# began passing to and fro he had no #heart# to beg
he had been crouching on the step for some #time# wondering at the great number of public #house# every other #house# in barnet was a tavern large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with ease in a few #hour# what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his #year# to accomplish when he was roused by observing that a #boy# who had passed him carelessly some #minute# before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite #side# of the #way#
he took little heed of this at first but the #boy# remained in the same attitude of close observation so long that $oliver_twist$ raised his #head# and returned his steady #look#
and there he sat upon this the #boy# crossed over and walking close up to $oliver_twist$ said hullo my covey what the row
the #boy# who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his own age but #one# of the queerest looking #boy# that $oliver_twist$ had even seen
he was a snub nosed flat browed common faced #boy# enough and as dirty a juvenile as #one# would wish to see but he had about him all the #air# and #manner# of a #man#
his #hat# was stuck on the top of his #head# so lightly that it threatened to fall off every #moment# and would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his #head# a sudden twitch which brought it back to its old #place# again
he was short of his age with rather bow legs and little sharp ugly #eye# he wore a #man# coat which reached nearly to his heels
he had turned the cuffs back half #way# up his #arm# to get his #hand# out of the sleeves apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the #pocket# of his corduroy trousers for there he kept them
he was altogether as roystering and swaggering a young #gentleman# as ever stood four #foot# six or #something# less in the bluchers
hullo my covey what the row said this strange young #gentleman# to $oliver_twist$ i am very hungry and tired replied $oliver_twist$ the #tear# standing in his #eye# as he spoke
i have walked a long #way# i have been walking these seven #day# walking for sivin #day# said the young #gentleman#
oh i see beak order eh but he added noticing $oliver_twist$ #look# of surprise i suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash com pan i on
$oliver_twist$ mildly replied that he had always heard a bird mouth described by the term in question my #eye# how green exclaimed the young #gentleman#
why a beak a madgst rate and when you walk by a beak order it not straight forerd but always agoing up and niver a coming down agin
why the mill the mill as takes up so little #room# that it ll work inside a stone jug and always goes better when the wind low with #people# than when it high acos then they cant get workmen
was you never on the mill what mill inquired $oliver_twist$ what mill but come said the young #gentleman# you want grub and you shall have it
i at low #water# mark myself only #one# bob and a magpie but as far as it goes i ll fork out and stump
assisting $oliver_twist$ to rise the young #gentleman# took him to an adjacent chandler shop where he purchased a sufficiency of ready dressed ham and a half quartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny bran
the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb and stuffing it therein
taking the bread under his #arm# the young gentlman turned into a small public #house# and led the #way# to a tap #room# in the rear of the premises
here a pot of beer was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth and $oliver_twist$ falling to at his new #friend# bidding made a long and hearty meal during the progress of which the strange #boy# eyed him from #time# to #time# with great attention
up with you on your pins there now then morrice going to london said the strange #boy# when $oliver_twist$ had at #length# concluded
the strange #boy# whistled and put his #arm# into his #pocket# as far as the big coat sleeves would let them go
yes got any lodgings no money no do you live in london inquired $oliver_twist$ yes i do when i at home replied the #boy#
i have not slept under a roof since i left the country dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young #gentleman#
i ve got to be in london to #night# and i know a spectable old #gentleman# as #life# there wot ll give you lodgings for nothink and never ask for the change that is if any genelman he knows interduces you
i suppose you want some #place# to sleep in to #night# dont you i do indeed answered $oliver_twist$ and dont he know me
the young #gentleman# smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical and finished the beer as he did so
this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the old #gentleman# referred to would doubtless provide $oliver_twist$ with a comfortable #place# without loss of #time#
this led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue from which $oliver_twist$ discovered that his #friend# #name# was jack dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly #gentleman# before mentioned
mr dawkin appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection but as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate #friend# he was better known by the sobriquet of the artful dodger $oliver_twist$ concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him
under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old #gentleman# as quickly as possible and if he found the dodger incorrigible as he more than half suspected he should to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance
as $mr_john_dawkins$ objected to their entering london before nightfall it was nearly eleven clock when they reached the turnpike at islington
they crossed from the angel into st $mr_john_dawkins$ road struck down the small #street# which terminates at sadler wells theatre through exmouth #street# and coppice row down the little court by the #side# of the workhouse across the classic #ground# which once bore the #name# of hockley in the hole thence into little saffron hill and so into saffron hill the great along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace directing $oliver_twist$ to follow close at his heels
although $oliver_twist$ had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either #side# of the #way# as he passed along
oh no not in the least by no means certainly not a dirtier or more wretched #place# he had never seen
there were a good many small shops but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of #child# who even at that #time# of #night# were crawling in and out at the #door# or screaming from the inside
the sole #place# that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the #place# were the public #house# and in them the lowest orders of irish were wrangling with might and main
covered #way# and yards which here and there diverged from the main #street# disclosed little knots of #house# where drunken #man# and #woman# were positively wallowing in filth and from several of the #door# #way# great ill looking fellows were cautiously emerging bound to all appearance on no very well disposed or harmless errands
the #street# was very narrow and muddy and the #air# was impregnated with filthy odours $oliver_twist$ was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when they reached the bottom of the hill
his conductor catching him by the #arm# pushed open the #door# of a #house# near field lane and drawing him into the passage closed it behind them
now then cried a #voice# from below in reply to a whistle from the dodger plummy and slam was the reply
this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right for the #light# of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage and a #man# #face# peeped out from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away
there two on you said the #man# thrusting the candle farther out and shielding his #eye# with his #hand# who thet other #one#
a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling $oliver_twist$ forward where did he come from greenland is $mr_fagin$ upstairs
$oliver_twist$ groping his #way# with #one# #hand# and having the other firmly grasped by his #companion# ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them
yes he a sortin the wipes up with you the candle was drawn back and the #face# disappeared he threw open the #door# of a back #room# and drew $oliver_twist$ in after him
there was a deal #table# before the #fire# upon which were a candle stuck in a ginger beer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf and butter and a plate
in a frying pan which was on the #fire# and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string some sausages were cooking and standing over them with a toasting fork in his #hand# was a very old shrivelled jew whose villainous looking and repulsive #face# was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair
he was dressed in a greasy flannel gown with his throat bare and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying pan and the clothes horse over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging
the walls and ceiling of the #room# were perfectly black with age and dirt several rough #bed# made of old sacks were huddled #side# by #side# on the floor
seated round the #table# were four or five #boy# none older than the dodger smoking long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the #air# of middle aged #man#
these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few #word# to the jew and then turned round and grinned at $oliver_twist$
the jew grinned and making a low obeisance to $oliver_twist$ took him by the #hand# and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance
upon this the young #gentleman# with the pipes came round him and shook both his #hand# very hard especially the #one# in which he held his little bundle
#one# young #gentleman# was very anxious to hang up his cap for him and another was so obliging as to put his #hand# in his #pocket# in order that as he was very tired he might not have the trouble of emptying them himself when he went to #bed#
these civilities would probably be extended much farther but for a liberal exercise of the jew toasting fork on the #head# and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them
so did the jew himself toasting fork in #hand# this is him $mr_fagin$ said jack dawkins my #friend# $oliver_twist$ we are very glad to see you $oliver_twist$ very said the jew
dodger take off the sausages and draw a tub near the #fire# for $oliver_twist$ ah you re a staring at the #pocket# handkerchiefs eh my #dear#
there are a good many of em aint there we ve just looked em out ready for the wash that all $oliver_twist$ that all
the latter #part# of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old #gentleman#
$oliver_twist$ ate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin and #water# telling him he must drink it off directly because another #gentleman# wanted the tumbler
immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to #one# of the sacks and then he sunk into a deep sleep
ha ha ha in the midst of which they went to supper $oliver_twist$ did as he was desired #chapter# ix containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old #gentleman# and his hopeful pupils
there was no other #person# in the #room# but the old jew who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon
he would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and stirring again as before
it was late next #morning# when $oliver_twist$ awoke from a sound long sleep although $oliver_twist$ had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly awake
there is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you dream more in five #minute# with your #eye# half open and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in five #night# with your #eye# fast closed and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness
at such #time# a mortal knows just enough of what his #mind# is doing to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning #time# and space when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate
he saw the jew with his half closed #eye# heard his low whistling and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan #side# and yet the self same senses were mentally engaged at the same #time# in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known
standing then in an irresolute attitude for a few #minute# as if he did not well know how to employ himself he turned round and looked at $oliver_twist$ and called him by his #name#
$oliver_twist$ was precisely in this condition when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob he did not answer and was to all appearances asleep
after satisfying himself upon this #head# the jew stepped gently to the #door# which he fastened he then drew forth as it seemed to $oliver_twist$ from some trap in the floor
a small box which he placed carefully on the #table# his #eye# glistened as he raised the lid and looked in
dragging an old #chair# to the #table# he sat down and took from it a magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels
aha said the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every feature with a hideous grin clever #dog# clever #dog#
staunch to the last never told the old parson where they were never poached upon old $mr_fagin$ and why should they
it wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept the drop up a #minute# longer no no no fine fellows fine fellows
with these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the jew once more deposited the watch in its #place# of safety
at least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed with equal pleasure besides rings brooches bracelets and other articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly workmanship that $oliver_twist$ had no idea even of their #name#
there seemed to be some very #minute# inscription on it for the jew laid it flat upon the #table# and shading it with his #hand# pored over it long and earnestly
at #length# he put it down as if despairing of success and leaning back in his #chair# muttered what a fine #thing# capital punishment is
having replaced these trinkets the jew took out another so small that it lay in the palm of his #hand# dead #man# never repent dead #man# never bring awkward stories to #light#
ah it a fine #thing# for the trade five of em strung up in a row and none left to play booty or turn white livered
as the jew uttered these #word# his bright dark #eye# which had been staring vacantly before him fell on $oliver_twist$ #face# the #boy# #eye# were fixed on his in mute curiousity and although the recognition was only for an instant for the briefest space of #time# that can possibly be conceived it was enough to show the old #man# that he had been observed
he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and laying his #hand# on a bread knife which was on the #table# started furiously up
he trembled very much though for even in his terror $oliver_twist$ could see that the knife quivered in the #air#
what that said the jew what do you watch me for why are you awake what have you seen speak out #boy#
quick quick for your #life# i wasnt able to sleep any longer #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ meekly i am very sorry if i have disturbed you #sir#
you were not awake an #hour# ago said the jew scowling fiercely on the #boy# no no indeed replied $oliver_twist$
are you sure cried the jew with a still fiercer #look# than before and a threatening attitude upon my #word# i was not #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ earnestly
tush tush my #dear# said the jew abruptly resuming his old #manner# and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport
i was not indeed #sir# of course i know that my #dear# i only tried to frighten you you re a brave #boy#
ha ha you re a brave #boy# $oliver_twist$ the jew rubbed his #hand# with a chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding
did you see any of these pretty #thing# my #dear# said the jew laying his #hand# upon it after a short pause
yes #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ ah said the jew turning rather pale they they re mine $oliver_twist$ my little property all i have to live upon in my old age
$oliver_twist$ #thought# the old #gentleman# must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty #place# with so many watches but thinking that perhaps his fondness for the dodger and the other #boy# cost him a good deal of money he only cast a deferential #look# at the jew and asked if he might get up
the folks call me a miser my #dear# only a miser that all certainly my #dear# certainly replied the old #gentleman#
stay there a pitcher of #water# in the #corner# by the #door# bring it here and i ll give you a basin to wash in my #dear#
$oliver_twist$ got up walked across the #room# and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher when he turned his #head# the box was gone
he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying the basin out of the #window# agreeably to the jew directions when the dodger returned
accompanied by a very sprightly young #friend# whom $oliver_twist$ had seen smoking on the previous #night# and who was now formally introduced to him as $charley_bates$
the four sat down to breakfast on the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought home in the crown of his #hat#
well said the jew glancing slyly at $oliver_twist$ and addressing himself to the dodger i hope you ve been at work this #morning# my #dear#
hard replied the dodger as nails added $charley_bates$ good #boy# good #boy# said the jew what have you got dodger
a couple of #pocket# #book# replied that young gentlman lined inquired the jew with eagerness pretty well replied the dodger producing two #pocket# #book# #one# green and the other red
not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the insides carefully but very neat and nicely made
at which mr charles $charley_bates$ laughed uproariously very much to the amazement of $oliver_twist$ who saw #nothing# to laugh at in #anything# that had passed
ingenious workman aint he $oliver_twist$ very indeed #sir# said $oliver_twist$ and what have you got my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ to $charley_bates$
wipes replied #master# $charley_bates$ at the same #time# producing four #pocket# handkerchiefs well said the jew inspecting them closely they re very good #one# very
you havent marked them well though $charley_bates$ so the marks shall be picked out with a needle and we ll teach $oliver_twist$ how to do it
shall us $oliver_twist$ eh ha ha ha if you please #sir# said $oliver_twist$ you like to be able to make #pocket# handkerchiefs as easy as $charley_bates$ wouldnt you my #dear# said the jew
#master# $charley_bates$ saw #something# so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that he burst into another laugh which laugh meeting the coffee he was drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation
very much indeed if you ll teach me #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ he is so jolly green said $charley_bates$ when he recovered as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour
the dodger said #nothing# but he smoothed $oliver_twist$ hair over his #eye# and said he know better by and by upon which the old #gentleman# observing $oliver_twist$ colour mounting changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that #morning#
this made him wonder more and more for it was plain from the replies of the two #boy# that they had both been there and $oliver_twist$ naturally wondered how they could possibly have found #time# to be so very industrious
when the breakfast was cleared away the merry old gentlman and the two #boy# played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in this #way#
the merry old #gentleman# placing a snuff box in #one# #pocket# of his trousers a note case in the other and a watch in his waistcoat #pocket# with a guard chain round his neck and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his spectacle case and handkerchief in his #pocket# trotted up and down the #room# with a stick in imitation of the #manner# in which old #gentleman# walk about the #street# any #hour# in the #day#
sometimes he stopped at the #fire# #place# and sometimes at the #door# making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop #window#
at such #time# he would #look# constantly round him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping all his #pocket# in turn to see that he hadnt lost #anything# in such a very funny and natural #manner# that $oliver_twist$ laughed till the #tear# ran down his #face#
all this #time# the two #boy# followed him closely about getting out of his sight so nimbly every #time# he turned round that it was impossible to follow their motions
at last the dodger trod upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidently while $charley_bates$ stumbled up against him behind and in that #one# #moment# they took from him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuff box note case watch guard chain shirt pin #pocket# handkerchief even the spectacle case
if the old gentlman felt a #hand# in any #one# of his #pocket# he cried out where it was and then the game began all over again
when this game had been played a great many #time# a couple of young #lady# called to see the young #gentleman# #one# of whom was named bet and the other $miss_nancy$
they wore a good deal of hair not very neatly turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings
they were not exactly pretty perhaps but they had a great deal of colour in their #face# and looked quite stout and hearty
being remarkably free and agreeable in their #manner# $oliver_twist$ #thought# them very nice #girl# indeed as there is no doubt they were
spirits were produced in consequence of #one# of the young #lady# complaining of a coldness in her inside and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn
the visitors stopped a long #time# at #length# $charley_bates$ expressed his opinion that it was #time# to pad the hoof
this it occurred to $oliver_twist$ must be french for going out for directly afterwards the dodger and $charley_bates$ and the two young #lady# went away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with money to spend
there my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ that a pleasant #life# isnt it they have gone out for the #day# have they done work #sir# inquired $oliver_twist$
yes said the jew that is unless they should unexpectedly come across any when they are out and they wont neglect it if they do my #dear# depend upon it
make em your models tapping the #fire# shovel on the hearth to add force to his #word# do everything they bid you and take their advice in all #matter# especially the dodger my #dear#
he ll be a great #man# himself and will make you #one# too if you take pattern by him is my handkerchief hanging out of my #pocket# my #dear# said the jew stopping short
see if you can take it out without my feeling it as you saw them do when we were at play this #morning#
$oliver_twist$ held up the bottom of the #pocket# with #one# #hand# as he had seen the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other
make em your models my #dear# yes #sir# said $oliver_twist$ is it gone cried the jew here it is #sir# said $oliver_twist$ showing it in his #hand#
you re a clever #boy# my #dear# said the playful old #gentleman# patting $oliver_twist$ on the #head# approvingly i never saw a sharper lad
here a shilling for you if you go on in this #way# you ll be the greatest #man# of the #time# and now come here and i ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs
$oliver_twist$ wondered what picking the old #gentleman# #pocket# in play had to do with his chances of being a great #man#
but thinking that the jew being so much his senior must know best he followed him quietly to the #table# and was soon deeply involved in his new study
#chapter# $oliver_twist$ becomes better acquainted with the characters of his new associates and purchases experience at a high price being a short but very important #chapter# in this history
for many #day# $oliver_twist$ remained in the jew #room# picking the marks out of the #pocket# handkerchief of which a great number were brought home and sometimes taking #part# in the game already described which the two #boy# and the jew played regularly every #morning#
at #length# he began to languish for fresh #air# and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old #gentleman# to allow him to go out to work with his two #companion#
$oliver_twist$ was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old #gentleman# character
whenever the dodger or $charley_bates$ came home at #night# empty handed he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active #life# by sending them supperless to #bed#
on #one# occasion indeed he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent
at #length# #one# #morning# $oliver_twist$ obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two or three #day# and the dinners had been rather meagre
perhaps these were reasons for the old #gentleman# giving his assent but whether they were or no he told $oliver_twist$ he might go and placed him under the joint guardianship of $charley_bates$ and his #friend# the dodger
the three #boy# sallied out the dodger with his coat sleeves tucked up and his #hat# cocked as usual #master# $charley_bates$ sauntering along with his #hand# in his #pocket# and $oliver_twist$ between them wondering where they were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first
the pace at which they went was such a very lazy ill looking saunter that $oliver_twist$ soon began to think his #companion# were going to deceive the old #gentleman# by not going to work at all
the dodger had a vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the #head# of small #boy# and tossing them down areas while $charley_bates$ exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel #side# and thrusting them into #pocket# which were so surprisingly capacious that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction
these #thing# looked so bad that $oliver_twist$ was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his #way# back in the best #way# he could when his #thought# were suddenly directed into another channel by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the #part# of the dodger
they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion of terms the green when the dodger made a sudden stop and laying his finger on his lip drew his #companion# back again with the greatest caution and circumspection
what the #matter# demanded $oliver_twist$ hush replied the dodger do you see that old cove at the #book# stall
the old #gentleman# over the #way# said $oliver_twist$ yes i see him he ll do said the dodger a prime plant observed #master# $charley_bates$
$oliver_twist$ looked from #one# to the other with the greatest surprise but he was not permitted to make any inquiries for the two #boy# walked stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old #gentleman# towards whom his attention had been directed
$oliver_twist$ walked a few paces after them and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood looking on in silent amazement
he was dressed in a bottle green coat with a black velvet collar wore white trousers and carried a smart bamboo cane under his #arm#
he had taken up a #book# from the stall and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his elbow #chair# in his own study
it is very possible that he fancied himself there indeed for it was plain from his abstraction that he saw not the #book# stall nor the #street# nor the #boy# nor in short #anything# but the #book# itself which he was reading straight through turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at the top line of the next #one# and going regularly on with the greatest interest and eagerness
what was $oliver_twist$ horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the dodger plunge his #hand# into the old #gentleman# #pocket# and draw from thence a handkerchief
to see him #hand# the same to $charley_bates$ and finally to behold them both running away round the #corner# at full speed
in an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs and the watches and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the #boy# #mind#
he stood for a #moment# with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning #fire# then confused and frightened he took to his heels and not knowing what he did made off as fast as he could lay his #foot# to the #ground#
the old #gentleman# was a very respectable looking personage with a powdered #head# and gold spectacles this was all done in a #minute# space
in the very instant when $oliver_twist$ began to run the old #gentleman# putting his #hand# to his #pocket# and missing his handkerchief turned sharp round
seeing the #boy# scudding away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator and shouting stop thief
with all his might made off after him #book# in #hand# but the old #gentleman# was not the only #person# who raised the hue and cry
the dodger and #master# $charley_bates$ unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open #street# had merely retired into the very first doorway round the #corner#
they no sooner heard the cry and saw $oliver_twist$ running than guessing exactly how the #matter# stood they issued forth with great promptitude and shouting stop thief
although $oliver_twist$ had been brought up by philosophers he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self preservation is the first law of nature
not being prepared however it alarmed him the more so away he went like the wind with the old #gentleman# and the two #boy# roaring and shouting behind him
too joined in the pursuit like good citizens if he had been perhaps he would have been prepared for this stop thief
the tradesman leaves his counter and the car #man# his waggon the butcher throws down his tray the baker his basket the milkman his pail the errand #boy# his parcels the school #boy# his marbles the paviour his pickaxe the #child# his battledore
helter skelter slap dash tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as they turn the #corner# rousing up the #dog# and astonishing the fowls and #street# squares and courts re echo with the sound
stop thief there is a magic in the sound away they run pell mell stop thief stop thief the cry is taken up by a hundred #voice# and the crowd accumulate at every turning
away they fly splashing through the mud and rattling along the pavements up go the #window# out run the #people# onward bear the mob a whole audience desert punch in the very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throng swell the shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry stop thief
#one# wretched breathless #child# panting with exhaustion terror in his #look# agony in his #eye# large drops of perspiration streaming down his #face# strains every nerve to make #head# upon his pursuers and as they follow on his track and gain upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with joy
stop thief stop thief stop thief there is a passion for hunting #something# deeply implanted in the human breast stop thief
he is down upon the pavement and the crowd eagerly gather round him each new comer jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse
ay stop him for god sake were it only in mercy stopped at last a clever blow stand aside give him a little #air#
nonsense he dont deserve it where the #gentleman# here his is coming down the #street# make #room# there for the #gentleman# is this the #boy# #sir# yes
$oliver_twist$ lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth looking wildly round upon the heap of #face# that surrounded him when the old #gentleman# was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers
yes said the #gentleman# i am afraid it is the #boy# afraid murmured the crowd that a good un poor fellow said the #gentleman# he has hurt himself
i did that #sir# said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward and preciously i cut my knuckle agin his mouth
the fellow touched his #hat# with a grin expecting #something# for his pains but the old #gentleman# eyeing him with an expression of dislike #look# anxiously round as if he contemplated running away himself which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is generally the last #person# to arrive in such cases at that #moment# made his #way# through the crowd and seized $oliver_twist$ by the collar
i stopped him #sir# come get up said the #man# roughly it wasnt me indeed #sir# indeed indeed it was two other #boy# said $oliver_twist$ clasping his #hand# passionately and looking round
he meant this to be ironical but it was true besides for the dodger and $charley_bates$ had filed off down the first convenient court they came to
they are here somewhere oh no they aint said the officer come get up dont hurt him said the old #gentleman# compassionately
oh no i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half off his back in proof thereof come i know you it wont do
$oliver_twist$ who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his #foot# and was at once lugged along the #street# by the jacket collar at a rapid pace
the #gentleman# walked on with them by the officer #side# and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat got a little ahead and stared back at $oliver_twist$ from #time# to #time#
will you stand upon your legs you young devil the #boy# shouted in triumph and on they went #chapter# xi treats of mr
the offence had been committed within the district and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of a very notorious metropolitan police office
the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying $oliver_twist$ through two or three #street# and down a #place# called mutton hill when he was led beneath a low archway and up a dirty court into this dispensary of summary justice by the back #way#
it was a small paved yard into which they turned and here they encountered a stout #man# with a bunch of whiskers on his #face# and a bunch of keys in his #hand#
$mr_fang$ the police magistrate and furnishes a slight specimen of his mode of administering justice what the #matter# now said the #man# carelessly
a young fogle hunter replied the #man# who had $oliver_twist$ in charge are you the party that been robbed #sir# inquired the #man# with the keys
yes i am replied the old #gentleman# but i am not sure that this #boy# actually took the handkerchief i i would rather not press the case
must go before the magistrate now #sir# replied the #man# his worship will be disengaged in half a #minute# now young gallows
this was an invitation for $oliver_twist$ to enter through a #door# which he unlocked as he spoke and which led into a stone cell
here he was searched and #nothing# being found upon him locked up this cell was in shape and size #something# like an area cellar only not so #light#
it was most intolerably dirty for it was monday #morning# and it had been tenanted by six drunken #people# who had been locked up elsewhere since saturday #night#
in our station #house# #man# and #woman# are every #night# confined on the most trivial charges the #word# is worth noting in dungeons compared with which those in newgate occupied by the most atrocious felons tried found guilty and under sentence of #death# are palaces
but this is little let any #one# who doubts this compare the two the old #gentleman# looked almost as rueful as $oliver_twist$ when the key grated in the lock
there is #something# in that #boy# #face# said the old #gentleman# to himself as he walked slowly away tapping his chin with the cover of the #book# in a thoughtful #manner# #something# that touches and interests me
he turned with a sigh to the #book# which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance can he be innocent
he looked like bye the bye exclaimed the old #gentleman# halting very abruptly and staring up into the sky bless my soul where
after musing for some #minute# the old #gentleman# walked with the same meditative #face# into a back anteroom opening from the yard and there retiring into a #corner# called up before his #mind# #eye# a vast amphitheatre of #face# over which a dusky curtain had hung for many #year#
have i seen #something# like that #look# before no said the old #gentleman# shaking his #head# it must be imagination he wandered over them again
he had called them into view and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them
there were the #face# of #friend# and foes and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd there were the #face# of young and blooming #girl# that were now old #woman# there were #face# that the grave had changed and closed upon but which the #mind# superior to its power still dressed in their old freshness and beauty calling back the lustre of the #eye# the brightness of the smile the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be set up as a #light# to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to heaven
so he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened and being happily for himself an absent old #gentleman# buried them again in the pages of the musty #book#
he was roused by a touch on the shoulder and a request from the #man# with the keys to follow him into the office
but the old #gentleman# could recall no #one# countenance of which $oliver_twist$ features bore a trace he closed his #book# hastily and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned $mr_fang$
$mr_fang$ sat behind a bar at the upper end and on #one# #side# the #door# was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little $oliver_twist$ was already deposited trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene
$mr_fang$ was a lean long backed stiff necked middle sized #man# with no great quantity of hair and what he had growing on the back and #side# of his #head#
if he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him he might have brought action against his countenance for libel and have recovered heavy damages
the old #gentleman# bowed respectfully and advancing to the magistrate desk said suiting the action to the #word# that is my #name# and address #sir#
he then withdrew a pace or two and with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the #head# waited to be questioned
now it so happened that $mr_fang$ was at that #moment# perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the #morning# adverting to some recent decision of his and commending him for the three hundred and fiftieth #time# to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state for the home department
the office was a front parlour with a panelled wall his #face# was stern and much flushed he was out of temper and he looked up with an angry scowl
who are you said $mr_fang$ the old #gentleman# pointed with some surprise to his card officer said $mr_fang$ tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper
who is this fellow my #name# #sir# said the old #gentleman# speaking like a #gentleman# my #name# #sir# is $mr_brownlow$
permit me to inquire the #name# of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable #person# under the protection of the bench
saying this $mr_brownlow$ looked around the office as if in search of some #person# who would afford him the required information
officer said $mr_fang$ throwing the paper on #one# #side# what this fellow charged with he not charged at all your worship replied the officer
he appears against this #boy# your worship his worship knew this perfectly well but it was a good annoyance and a safe #one#
before i am sworn i must beg to say #one# #word# said $mr_brownlow$ and that is that i really never without actual experience could have believed
appears against the #boy# does he said $mr_fang$ surveying $mr_brownlow$ contemptuously from #head# to #foot# swear him
hold your tongue #sir# said $mr_fang$ peremptorily i will not #sir# replied the old #gentleman# hold your tongue this instant or i ll have you turned out of the office said $mr_fang$
you re an insolent impertinent fellow how dare you bully a magistrate what exclaimed the old #gentleman# reddening swear this #person# said $mr_fang$ to the clerk
$mr_brownlow$ indignation was greatly roused but reflecting perhaps that he might only injure the #boy# by giving vent to it he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once
i ll not hear another #word# swear him now said $mr_fang$ what the charge against this #boy# what have you got to say #sir#
i was standing at a bookstall $mr_brownlow$ began hold your tongue #sir# said $mr_fang$ policeman where the policeman
the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the charge how he had searched $oliver_twist$ and found #nothing# on his #person# and how that was all he knew about it
here swear this policeman now policeman what is this are there any witnesses inquired $mr_fang$ none your worship replied the policeman
$mr_fang$ sat silent for some #minute# and then turning round to the prosecutor said in a towering passion do you mean to state what your complaint against this #boy# is #man# or do you not
now if you stand there refusing to give evidence i ll punish you for disrespect to the bench i will by by what or by whom nobody knows for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud just at the right #moment# and the former dropped a heavy #book# upon the floor thus preventing the #word# from being heard accidently of course
with many interruptions and repeated insults $mr_brownlow$ contrived to state his case observing that in the surprise of the #moment# he had run after the #boy# because he had saw him running away and expressing his hope that if the magistrate should believe him although not actually the thief to be connected with the thieves he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow
you have been sworn he has been hurt already said the old #gentleman# in conclusion and i fear he added with great energy looking towards the bar i really fear that he is ill
oh yes i dare say said $mr_fang$ with a sneer come none of your tricks here you young vagabond they wont do
what your #name# $oliver_twist$ tried to reply but his tongue failed him he was deadly pale and the whole #place# seemed turning round and round
what your #name# you hardened scoundrel demanded $mr_fang$ officer what his #name# this was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat who was standing by the bar
he bent over $oliver_twist$ and repeated the inquiry but finding him really incapable of understanding the question and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more and add to the severity of his sentence he hazarded a guess
he says his #name# $tom_white$ your worship said the kind hearted thief taker oh he wont speak out wont he said $mr_fang$
very well very well where does he live where he can your worship replied the officer again pretending to receive $oliver_twist$ answer
has he any parents inquired $mr_fang$ he says they died in his infancy your worship replied the officer hazarding the usual reply
at this point of the inquiry $oliver_twist$ raised his #head# and looking round with imploring #eye# murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of #water#
stuff and nonsense said $mr_fang$ dont try to make a fool of me i think he really is ill your worship remonstrated the officer
i know better said $mr_fang$ take care of him officer said the old #gentleman# raising his #hand# instinctively he ll fall down
stand away officer cried $mr_fang$ let him if he likes $oliver_twist$ availed himself of the kind permission and fell to the floor in a fainting fit
the #man# in the office looked at each other but no #one# dared to stir i knew he was shamming said $mr_fang$ as if this were incontestable proof of the fact
let him lie there he ll soon be tired of that how do you propose to deal with the case #sir# inquired the clerk in a low #voice#
the #door# was opened for this purpose and a couple of #man# were preparing to carry the insensible #boy# to his cell when an elderly #man# of decent but poor appearance clad in an old suit of black rushed hastily into the office and advanced towards the bench
summarily replied $mr_fang$ he stands committed for three months hard labour of course clear the office stop stop dont take him away
although the presiding genii in such an office as this exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties the good #name# the character almost the #life# of her majesty subjects expecially of the poorer class and although within such walls enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping they are closed to the public save through the medium of the daily press footnote
for heaven sake stop a #moment# cried the new comer breathless with haste or were virtually then $mr_fang$ was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder
what is this who is this turn this #man# out clear the office cried $mr_fang$ i will speak cried the #man# i will not be turned out
i saw it all i keep the #book# stall i demand to be sworn i will not be put down $mr_fang$ you must hear me
you must not refuse #sir# the #man# was right his #manner# was determined and the #matter# was growing rather too serious to be hushed up
swear the #man# growled $mr_fang$ with a very ill grace now #man# what have you got to say
this said the #man# i saw three #boy# two others and the prisoner here loitering on the opposite #side# of the #way# when this #gentleman# was reading
the robbery was committed by another #boy# i saw it done and i saw that this #boy# was perfectly amazed and stupified by it
having by this #time# recovered a little breath the worthy #book# stall keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent #manner# the exact circumstances of the robbery
why didnt you come here before said $mr_fang$ after a pause i hadnt a soul to #mind# the shop replied the #man#
everybody who could have helped me had joined in the pursuit i could get nobody till five #minute# ago and i ve run here all the #way#
the prosecutor was reading was he inquired $mr_fang$ after another pause yes replied the #man# the very #book# he has in his #hand#
oh that #book# eh said $mr_fang$ is it paid for no it is not replied the #man# with a smile
a nice #person# to prefer a charge against a poor #boy# said $mr_fang$ with a comical effort to #look# humane
i consider #sir# that you have obtained possession of that #book# under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute
#dear# me i forgot all about it exclaimed the absent old #gentleman# innocently let this be a lesson to you my #man# or the law will overtake you yet
the #boy# is discharged clear the office n me cried the old #gentleman# bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long n me
the mandate was obeyed and the indignant $mr_brownlow$ was conveyed out with the #book# in #one# #hand# and the bamboo cane in the other in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance
i ll clear the office said the magistrate officers do you hear clear the office he reached the yard and his passion vanished in a #moment#
little $oliver_twist$ lay on his back on the pavement with his shirt unbuttoned and his temples bathed with #water# his #face# a deadly white and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame
a coach was obtained and $oliver_twist$ having been carefully laid on the seat the old #gentleman# got in and sat himself on the other
poor #boy# poor #boy# said $mr_brownlow$ bending over him call a coach somebody pray directly may i accompany you said the #book# stall keeper looking in
bless me yes my #dear# #sir# said $mr_brownlow$ quickly i forgot you #dear# dear i have this unhappy #book# still
jump in poor fellow there no #time# to lose the #book# stall keeper got into the coach and away they drove #chapter# xii in which $oliver_twist$
is taken better care of than he ever was before and in which the narrative reverts to the merry old #gentleman#
the coach rattled away over nearly the same #ground# as that which $oliver_twist$ had traversed when he first entered london in company with the dodger and turning a different #way# when it reached the angel at islington stopped at #length# before a neat #house# in a quiet shady #street# near pentonville
here a #bed# was prepared without loss of #time# in which $mr_brownlow$ saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited and here he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds
the sun $miss_rose$ and sank and $miss_rose$ and sank again and many #time# after that and still the #boy# lay stretched on his uneasy #bed# dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever
the worm does not work more surely on the dead body than does this slow creeping #fire# upon the living frame
and his youthful #friend# but for many #day# $oliver_twist$ remained insensible to all the goodness of his new #friend# weak and thin and pallid he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream
feebly raising himself in the #bed# with his #head# resting on his trembling #arm# he looked anxiously around what #room# is this
where have i been brought to said $oliver_twist$ this is not the #place# i went to sleep in he uttered these #word# in a feeble #voice# being very faint and weak but they were overheard at once
the curtain at the #bed# #head# was hastily drawn back and a motherly old #lady# very neatly and precisely dressed $miss_rose$ as she undrew it from an #arm# #chair# close by in which she had been sitting at needle work
you must be very quiet or you will be ill again and you have been very bad as bad as bad could be pretty nigh
with those #word# the old #lady# very gently placed $oliver_twist$ #head# upon the pillow and smoothing back his hair from his forehead looked so kindly and loving in his #face# that he could not help placing his little withered #hand# in hers and drawing it round his neck
hush my #dear# said the old #lady# softly lie down again there a #dear# save us said the old #lady# with #tear# in her #eye#
what a grateful little #dear# it is pretty creetur what would his #mother# feel if she had sat by him as i have and could see him now
perhaps she does see me whispered $oliver_twist$ folding his #hand# together perhaps she has sat by me i almost feel as if she had
i suppose it was replied $oliver_twist$ because heaven is a long #way# off and they are too happy there to come down to the bedside of a poor #boy#
but if she knew i was ill she must have pitied me even there for she was very ill herself before she died
that was the fever my #dear# said the old #lady# mildly she cant know #anything# about me though added $oliver_twist$ after a #moment# #silence#
if she had seen me hurt it would have made her sorrowful and her #face# has always looked sweet and happy when i have dreamed of her
the old #lady# made no reply to this but wiping her #eye# first and her spectacles which lay on the counterpane afterwards as if they were #part# and parcel of those features brought some cool stuff for $oliver_twist$ to drink and then patting him on the cheek told him he must lie very quiet or he would be ill again
so $oliver_twist$ kept very still partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old #lady# in all #thing# and partly to tell the truth because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said
he soon fell into a gentle doze from which he was awakened by the #light# of a candle which being brought near the #bed# showed him a #gentleman# with a very large and loud ticking gold watch in his #hand# who felt his pulse and said he was a great deal better
you are a great deal better are you not my #dear# said the #gentleman# yes thank you #sir# replied $oliver_twist$
yes i know you are said the #gentleman# you re hungry too ant you no #sir# answered $oliver_twist$ hem said the #gentleman#
the old #lady# made a respectful inclination of the #head# which seemed to say that she #thought# the #doctor# was a very clever #man#
no i know you re not he is not hungry $mrs_bedwin$ said the #gentleman# looking very wise the #doctor# appeared much of the same opinion himself
you feel sleepy dont you my #dear# said the #doctor# no #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ no said the #doctor# with a very shrewd and satisfied #look#
you re not sleepy nor thirsty are you yes #sir# rather thirsty answered $oliver_twist$ just as i expected $mrs_bedwin$ said the #doctor#
it very natural that he should be thirsty you may give him a little tea ma am and some dry toast without any butter
dont keep him too warm ma am but be careful that you dont let him be too cold will you have the goodness
the #doctor# after tasting the cool stuff and expressing a qualified approval of it hurried away his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy #manner# as he went downstairs
the old #lady# dropped a curtsey $oliver_twist$ dozed off again soon after this when he awoke it was nearly twelve clock
the old #lady# tenderly bade him good #night# shortly afterwards and left him in charge of a fat old #woman# who had just come bringing with her in a little bundle a small prayer #book# and a large nightcap
putting the latter on her #head# and the former on the #table# the old #woman# after telling $oliver_twist$ that she had come to sit up with him drew her #chair# close to the #fire# and went off into a series of short naps chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward and divers moans and chokings
these however had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard and then fall asleep again and thus the #night# crept slowly on
$oliver_twist$ lay awake for some #time# counting the little circles of #light# which the reflection of the rushlight shade threw upon the ceiling or tracing with his languid #eye# the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall
the darkness and the deep stillness of the #room# were very solemn as they brought into the #boy# #mind# the #thought# that #death# had been hovering there for many #day# and #night# and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence he turned his #face# upon the pillow and fervently prayed to heaven
gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from
who if this were #death# would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of #life# to all its cares for the present its anxieties for the future more than all its weary recollections of the past
it had been bright #day# for #hour# when $oliver_twist$ opened his #eye# he felt cheerful and happy the crisis of the disease was safely past
in three #day# #time# he was able to sit in an easy #chair# well propped up with pillows and as he was still too weak to walk $mrs_bedwin$ had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper #room# which belonged to her
having him set here by the #fire# #side# the good old #lady# sat herself down too and being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better forthwith began to cry most violently
he belonged to the world again never #mind# me my #dear# said the old #lady# i only having a regular good cry
there it all over now and i quite comfortable you re very very kind to me ma am said $oliver_twist$ well never you #mind# that my #dear# said the old #lady# that got #nothing# to do with your broth and
it full #time# you had it for the #doctor# says $mr_brownlow$ may come in to see you this #morning# and we must get up our best #look# because the better we #look# the more he ll be pleased
and with this the old #lady# applied herself to warming up in a little saucepan a basin full of broth strong enough $oliver_twist$ #thought# to furnish an ample dinner when reduced to the regulation strength for three hundred and fifty paupers at the lowest computation
are you fond of pictures #dear# inquired the old #lady# seeing that $oliver_twist$ had fixed his #eye# most intently on a portrait which hung against the wall just opposite his #chair#
i dont quite know ma am said $oliver_twist$ without taking his #eye# from the canvas i have seen so few that i hardly know
ah said the old #lady# painters always make #lady# out prettier than they are or they wouldnt get any custom #child#
the #man# that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed it a deal too honest
what a beautiful mild #face# that #lady# is a deal said the old #lady# laughing very heartily at her own acuteness
is is that a likeness ma am said $oliver_twist$ yes said the old #lady# looking up for a #moment# from the broth that a portrait
whose ma am asked $oliver_twist$ why really my #dear# i dont know answered the old #lady# in a good humoured #manner#
it not a likeness of anybody that you or i know i expect it seems to strike your fancy #dear# it is so pretty replied $oliver_twist$
why sure you re not afraid of it said the old #lady# observing in great surprise the #look# of awe with which the #child# regarded the painting
oh no no returned $oliver_twist$ quickly but the #eye# #look# so sorrowful and where i sit they seem fixed upon me
it makes my #heart# beat added $oliver_twist$ in a low #voice# as if it was alive and wanted to speak to me but couldnt
lord save us exclaimed the old #lady# starting dont talk in that #way# #child# you re weak and nervous after your illness
let me wheel your #chair# round to the other #side# and then you wont see it there said the old #lady# suiting the action to the #word# you dont see it now at all events
$oliver_twist$ did see it in his #mind# #eye# as distinctly as if he had not altered his position but he #thought# it better not to worry the kind old #lady# so he smiled gently when she looked at him and $mrs_bedwin$ satisfied that he felt more comfortable salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation
he had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful when there came a soft rap at the #door# come in said the old #lady# and in walked $mr_brownlow$
now the old #gentleman# came in as brisk as need be but he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead and thrust his #hand# behind the skirts of his dressing gown to take a good long #look# at $oliver_twist$ than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions
$oliver_twist$ looked very worn and shadowy from sickness and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up out of respect to his benefactor which terminated in his sinking back into the #chair# again and the fact is if the truth must be told that $mr_brownlow$ #heart# being large enough for any six ordinary old #gentleman# of humane disposition forced a supply of #tear# into his #eye# by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain
$oliver_twist$ got through it with extraordinary expedition poor #boy# poor #boy# said $mr_brownlow$ clearing his throat i rather hoarse this #morning# $mrs_bedwin$
i afraid i have caught cold i hope not #sir# said $mrs_bedwin$ everything you have had has been well aired #sir#
i dont know said $mr_brownlow$ i rather think i had a damp napkin at dinner #time# yesterday but never #mind# that
i dont know $mrs_bedwin$ how do you feel my #dear# very happy #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ and very grateful indeed #sir# for your goodness to me
he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth #sir# replied $mrs_bedwin$ drawing herself up slightly and laying strong emphasis on the last #word# to intimate that between slops and broth will compounded there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever
ugh said $mr_brownlow$ with a slight shudder a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good
wouldnt they $tom_white$ eh my #name# is $oliver_twist$ #sir# replied the little invalid with a #look# of great astonishment
good by said $mr_brownlow$ stoutly have you given him any nourishment $mrs_bedwin$ any slops eh $oliver_twist$ said $mr_brownlow$ $oliver_twist$ what
$oliver_twist$ white eh no #sir# twist $oliver_twist$ queer #name# said the old #gentleman# what made you tell the magistrate your #name# was white i never told him so #sir# returned $oliver_twist$ in amazement
this sounded so like a falsehood that the old #gentleman# looked somewhat sternly in $oliver_twist$ #face# it was impossible to doubt him there was truth in every #one# of its thin and sharpened lineaments
but although his motive for looking steadily at $oliver_twist$ no longer existed the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar #face# came upon him so strongly that he could not withdraw his gaze
some mistake said $mr_brownlow$ i hope you are not angry with me #sir# said $oliver_twist$ raising his #eye# beseechingly
no no replied the old #gentleman# why what this $mrs_bedwin$ #look# there as he spoke he pointed hastily to the picture over $oliver_twist$ #head# and then to the #boy# #face#
there was its living copy the #eye# the #head# the mouth every feature was the same the expression was for the instant so precisely alike that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy
$oliver_twist$ knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation for not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him he fainted away
a weakness on his #part# which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense in behalf of the two young pupils of the merry old #gentleman# and of recording that when the dodger and his accomplished #friend# #master# $charley_bates$ joined in the hue and cry which was raised at $oliver_twist$ heels in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of $mr_brownlow$ personal property as has been already described they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true hearted englishman so i need hardly beg the reader to observe that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic #man# in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound judging philosophers have laid down as the main springs of all nature deeds and actions the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good #lady# proceedings to #matter# of maxim and theory and by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding putting entirely out of sight any considerations of #heart# or generous impulse and feeling
for these are #matter# totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex
if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young #gentleman# in their very delicate predicament i should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a foregoing #part# of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when the general attention was fixed upon $oliver_twist$ and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut
although i do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings like unto those in which drunken #man# under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge still i do mean to say and do say distinctly that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers in carrying out their theories to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves
thus to do a great right you may do a little wrong and you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify the amount of the right or the amount of the wrong or indeed the distinction between the two being left entirely to the philosopher concerned to be settled and determined by his clear comprehensive and impartial view of his own particular case
it was not until the two #boy# had scoured with great rapidity through a most intricate maze of narrow #street# and courts that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway
having remained silent here just long enough to recover breath to speak #master# $charley_bates$ uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight and bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter flung himself upon a doorstep and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth
what the #matter# inquired the dodger ha ha ha roared $charley_bates$ hold your noise remonstrated the dodger looking cautiously round
to see him splitting away at that pace and cutting round the #corner# and knocking up again the posts and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them and me with the wipe in my #pocket# singing out arter him oh my #eye#
do you want to be grabbed stupid i cant help it said $charley_bates$ i cant help it the vivid imagination of #master# $charley_bates$ presented the scene before him in too strong colours
what ll $mr_fagin$ say inquired the dodger taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the #part# of his #friend# to propound the question
as he arrived at this apostrophe he again rolled upon the #door# step and laughed louder than before what repeated $charley_bates$
ah what said the dodger why what should he say inquired $charley_bates$ stopping rather suddenly in his merriment for the dodger #manner# was impressive
what should he say $mr_john_dawkins$ whistled for a couple of #minute# then taking off his #hat# scratched his #head# and nodded thrice
toor rul lol loo gammon and spinnage the frog he wouldnt and high cockolorum said the dodger with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance
what do you mean said $charley_bates$ this was explanatory but not satisfactory #master# $charley_bates$ felt it so and again said what do you mean
the dodger made no reply but putting his #hat# on again and gathering the skirts of his long tailed coat under his #arm# thrust his tongue into his cheek slapped the bridge of his nose some half dozen #time# in a familiar but expressive #manner# and turning on his heel slunk down the court
the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few #minute# after the occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old #gentleman# as he sat over the #fire# with a saveloy and a small loaf in his #hand# a #pocket# knife in his right and a pewter pot on the trivet
there was a rascally smile on his white #face# as he turned round and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows bent his ear towards the #door# and listened
#master# $charley_bates$ followed with a thoughtful countenance why how this muttered the jew changing countenance only two of em where the third
they cant have got into trouble hark the footsteps approached nearer they reached the landing the #door# was slowly opened and the dodger and $charley_bates$ entered closing it behind them
#chapter# xiii some new acquaintances are introduced to the intelligent reader connected with whom various pleasant #matter# are related appertaining to this history where $oliver_twist$
said the jew rising with a menacing #look# where the #boy# the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence and looked uneasily at each other
what become of the #boy# said the jew seizing the dodger tightly by the collar and threatening him with horrid imprecations
$mr_fagin$ looked so very much in earnest that $charley_bates$ who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe #side# and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised a loud well sustained and continuous roar #something# between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet
will you speak thundered the jew shaking the dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly miraculous
but they made no reply speak out or i ll throttle you why the traps have got him and that all about it said the dodger sullenly
and swinging himself at #one# jerk clean out of the big coat which he left in the jew #hand# the dodger snatched up the toasting fork and made a pass at the merry old #gentleman# waistcoat which if it had taken effect would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced
the jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could have been anticipated in a #man# of his apparent decrepitude and seizing up the pot prepared to hurl it at his assailant #head#
but $charley_bates$ at this #moment# calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl he suddenly altered its destination and flung it full at that young #gentleman#
come let go me will you why what the blazes is in the wind now growled a deep #voice#
who pitched that ere at me it well it the beer and not the pot as hit me or i have settled somebody
i might have know as nobody but an infernal rich plundering thundering old jew could afford to throw away any drink but #water# and not that unless he done the river company every quarter
wot it all about $mr_fagin$ me if my neck handkercher ant lined with beer come in you sneaking warmint wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your #master#
the #man# who growled out these #word# was a stoutly built fellow of about five and thirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab breeches lace up half boots and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs with large swelling calves the kind of legs which in such costume always #look# in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them
he had a brown #hat# on his #head# and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his #face# as he spoke
he disclosed when he had done so a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three #day# growth and two scowling #eye# #one# of which displayed various parti coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow
come in come in ye hear growled this engaging ruffian a white shaggy #dog# with his #face# scratched and torn in twenty different #place# skulked into the #room#
why didnt you come in afore said the #man# you re getting too proud to own me afore company are you
he appeared well used to it however for he coiled himself up in a #corner# very quietly without uttering a sound and winking his very ill looking #eye# twenty #time# in a #minute# appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment
lie down this command was accompanied with a kick which sent the animal to the other end of the #room# what are you up to
ill treating the #boy# you covetous avaricious in sa ti a ble old fence said the #man# seating himself deliberately i wonder they dont murder you
if i been your prentice i have done it long ago and no i couldnt have sold you afterwards for you re fit for #nothing# but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle and i suppose they dont blow glass bottles large enough
i would if i was them hush hush $mr_william_sikes$ said the jew trembling dont speak so loud none of your mistering replied the ruffian you always mean mischief when you come that
you know my #name# out with it i shant disgrace it when the #time# comes well well then $bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ said the jew with abject humility
perhaps i am replied $mr_william_sikes$ i should think you was rather out of sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about as you do when you blab and are you mad said the jew catching the #man# by the sleeve and pointing towards the #boy#
$mr_william_sikes$ contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear and jerking his #head# over on the right shoulder a piece of dumb show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly
he then in cant terms with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here demanded a glass of liquor
you seem out of humour $bill_sikes$ and #mind# you dont poison it said $mr_william_sikes$ laying his #hat# upon the #table#
this was said in jest but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard he might have #thought# the caution not wholly unnecessary or the wish at all events to improve upon the distiller ingenuity not very far from the old #gentleman# merry #heart#
after swallowing two of three glasses of spirits $mr_william_sikes$ condescended to take some notice of the young #gentleman# which gracious act led to a conversation in which the cause and #manner# of $oliver_twist$ capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances
i afraid said the jew that he may say #something# which will get us into trouble that very likely returned $mr_william_sikes$ with a malicious grin
and i afraid you see added the jew speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption and regarding the other closely as he did so i afraid that if the game was up with us it might be up with a good many more and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me my #dear#
but the old #gentleman# shoulders were shrugged up to his ears and his #eye# were vacantly staring on the opposite wall
every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections not excepting the #dog# who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first #gentleman# or #lady# he might encounter in the #street# when he went out
somebody must find out wot been done at the office said $mr_william_sikes$ in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in
you re blowed upon $mr_fagin$ the #man# started and turned round upon the jew there was a long pause the jew nodded assent
if he hasnt peached and is committed there no fear till he comes out again said $mr_william_sikes$ and then he must be taken care on
the prudence of this line of action indeed was obvious but unfortunately there was #one# very strong objection to its being adopted
this was that the dodger and $charley_bates$ and $mr_fagin$ and $mr_william_sikes$ happened #one# and all to entertain a violent and deeply rooted antipathy to going near a police office on any #ground# or pretext whatever
you must get hold of him somehow again the jew nodded how long they might have sat and looked at each other in a state of uncertainty
it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject however for the sudden entrance of the two young #lady# whom $oliver_twist$ had seen on a former occasion caused the conversation to flow afresh
not the most pleasant of its kind it is difficult to guess the very #thing# said the jew bet will go wont you my #dear# wheres inquired the young #lady#
it is due to the young #lady# to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be blessed if she would a polite and delicate evasion of the request which shows the young #lady# to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow creature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal
he turned from this young #lady# who was gaily not to say gorgeously attired in a red gown green boots and yellow curl papers to the other female
only just up to the office my #dear# said the jew coaxingly the jew countenance fell $miss_nancy$ my #dear# said the jew in a soothing #manner# what do you say
that it wont do so it no use a trying it on $mr_fagin$ replied $miss_nancy$ what do you mean by that said $mr_william_sikes$ looking up in a surly #manner#
what i say $bill_sikes$ replied the #lady# collectedly why you re just the very #person# for it reasoned $mr_william_sikes$ nobody about here knows #anything# of you
and as i dont want em to neither replied $miss_nancy$ in the same composed #manner# it rather more no than yes with me $bill_sikes$
she ll go $mr_fagin$ said $mr_william_sikes$ no she wont $mr_fagin$ said $miss_nancy$ yes she will $mr_fagin$ said $mr_william_sikes$ and $mr_william_sikes$ was right
she was not indeed withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable #friend# for having recently removed into the neighborhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb of ratcliffe she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances
accordingly with a clean white apron tied over her gown and her curl papers tucked up under a straw bonnet both articles of dress being provided from the jew inexhaustible stock miss
by dint of alternate threats promises and bribes the #lady# in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission $miss_nancy$ prepared to issue forth on her errand
it #look# more respectable my #dear# give her a #door# key to carry in hert other #one# $mr_fagin$ said $mr_william_sikes$ it #look# real and genivine like
yes yes my #dear# so it does said the jew hanging a large #street# #door# key on the forefinger of the young #lady# right #hand#
stop a #minute# my #dear# said the jew producing a little covered basket carry that in #one# #hand# there very good
my poor #dear# sweet innocent little brother exclaimed $miss_nancy$ bursting into #tear# and wringing the little basket and the #street# #door# key in an agony of distress
very good indeed my #dear# said the jew rubbing his #hand# oh my brother what has become of him where have they taken him to
oh do have pity and tell me what been done with the #dear# #boy# #gentleman# do #gentleman# if you please #gentleman#
having uttered those #word# in a most lamentable and #heart# broken tone to the immeasurable delight of her hearers $miss_nancy$ paused winked to the company nodded smilingly round and disappeared
ah she a clever #girl# my #dear# said the jew turning round to his young #friend# and shaking his #head# gravely as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld
she a honour to her sex said $mr_william_sikes$ filling his glass and smiting the #table# with his enormous fist
while these and many other encomiums were being passed on the accomplished $miss_nancy$ that young #lady# made the best of her #way# to the police office whither notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the #street# alone and unprotected she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards
here her health and wishing they was all like her entering by the back #way# she tapped softly with the key at #one# of the cell #door# and listened
there was no sound within so she coughed and listened again still there was no reply so she spoke nolly #dear#
there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal who had been taken up for playing the flute and who the offence against society having been clearly proved had been very properly committed by $mr_fang$ to the #house# of correction for #one# month with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument
he made no answer being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute which had been confiscated for the use of the county so $miss_nancy$ passed on to the next cell and knocked there
murmured $miss_nancy$ in a gentle #voice# nolly well cried a faint and feeble #voice# is there a little #boy# here inquired $miss_nancy$ with a preliminary sob
this was a vagrant of sixty five who was going to prison for not playing the flute or in other #word# for begging in the #street# and doing #nothing# for his livelihood
in the next cell was another #man# who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license thereby doing #something# for his living in defiance of the stamp office
but as neither of these criminals answered to the #name# of $oliver_twist$ or knew #anything# about him $miss_nancy$ made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the #street# #door# key and the little basket demanded her own #dear# brother
no replied the #voice# god forbid i havent got him my #dear# said the old #man# where is he screamed $miss_nancy$ in a distracted #manner#
in reply to this incoherent questioning the old #man# informed the deeply affected sister that $oliver_twist$ had been taken ill in the office and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another #boy# not in custody and that the prosecutor had carried him away in an insensible condition to his own residence of and concerning which all the informant knew was that it was somewhere in pentonville he having heard that #word# mentioned in the directions to the coachman
in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised young #woman# staggered to the gate and then exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of to the domicile of the jew
mr $bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered than he very hastily called up the white #dog# and putting on his #hat# expeditiously departed without devoting any #time# to the formality of wishing the company good #morning#
why the #gentleman# got him replied the officer what #gentleman# oh gracious heavens what #gentleman# exclaimed $miss_nancy$ we must know where he is my #dear# he must be found said the jew greatly excited
$charley_bates$ do #nothing# but skulk about till you bring home some news of him $miss_nancy$ my #dear# i must have him found
i trust to you my #dear# to you and the artful for everything stay stay added the jew unlocking a drawer with a shaking #hand#
there money my #dear# i shall shut up this shop to #night# you ll know where to find me dont stop here a #minute#
with these #word# he pushed them from the #room# and carefully double locking and barring the #door# behind them drew from its #place# of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to $oliver_twist$
not an instant my #dear# then he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing a rap at the #door# startled him in this occupation
who there he cried in a shrill tone me replied the #voice# of the dodger through the key hole what now cried the jew impatiently
is he to be kidnapped to the other ken $miss_nancy$ says inquired the dodger yes replied the jew wherever she lays #hand# on him
find him find him out that all i shall know what to do next never fear the #boy# murmured a reply of intelligence and hurried downstairs after his #companion#
he has not peached so far said the jew as he pursued his occupation if he means to blab us among his new #friend# we may stop his mouth yet
#chapter# xiv comprising further particulars of $oliver_twist$ stay at $mr_brownlow$ with the remarkable prediction which #one# $mr_grimwig$ uttered concerning him
when he went out on an errand $oliver_twist$ soon recovering from the fainting fit into which $mr_brownlow$ abrupt exclamation had thrown him the subject of the picture was carefully avoided both by the old #gentleman# and $mrs_bedwin$ in the conversation that ensued which indeed bore no reference to $oliver_twist$ history or prospects but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him
he was still too weak to get up to breakfast but when he came down into the housekeeper #room# next #day# his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall in the hope of again looking on the #face# of the beautiful #lady#
his expectations were disappointed however for the picture had been removed ah said the housekeeper watching the direction of $oliver_twist$ #eye#
it is gone you see i see it is ma am replied $oliver_twist$ why have they taken it away
it has been taken down #child# because $mr_brownlow$ said that as it seemed to worry you perhaps it might prevent your getting well you know rejoined the old #lady#
oh no indeed it didnt worry me ma am said $oliver_twist$ i liked to see it i quite loved it
well well said the old #lady# good humouredly you get well as fast as ever you can #dear# and it shall be hung up again
there i promise you that now let us talk about #something# else this was all the information $oliver_twist$ could obtain about the picture at that #time#
as the old #lady# had been so kind to him in his illness he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers who was married to an amiable and handsome #man# and lived in the country and about a son who was clerk to a merchant in the west indies and who was also such a good young #man# and wrote such dutiful letters home four #time# a #year# that it brought the #tear# into her #eye# to talk about them
when the old #lady# had expatiated a long #time# on the excellences of her #child# and the merits of her kind good husband besides who had been dead and gone poor #dear# soul
after tea she began to teach $oliver_twist$ cribbage which he learnt as quickly as she could teach and at which game they played with great interest and gravity until it was #time# for the invalid to have some warm wine and #water# with a slice of dry toast and then to go cosily to #bed#
everything was so quiet and neat and orderly everybody so kind and gentle that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived it seemed like heaven itself
he was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on properly than $mr_brownlow$ caused a complete new suit and a new cap and a new pair of shoes to be provided for him
as $oliver_twist$ was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him and asked her to sell them to a jew and keep the money for herself
this she very readily did and as $oliver_twist$ looked out of the parlour #window# and saw the jew roll them up in his bag and walk away he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again
just six and twenty #year# it was #time# to have tea they were happy #day# those of $oliver_twist$ recovery they were sad rags to tell the truth and $oliver_twist$ had never had a new suit before
#one# evening about a week after the affair of the picture as he was sitting talking to $mrs_bedwin$ there came a message down from $mr_brownlow$ that if $oliver_twist$ felt pretty well he should like to see him in his study and talk to him a little while
bless us and save us wash your #hand# and let me #part# your hair nicely for you #child# said $mrs_bedwin$
if we had known he would have asked for you we would have put you a clean collar on and made you as smart as sixpence
$oliver_twist$ did as the old #lady# bade him and although she lamented grievously meanwhile that there was not even #time# to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt collar he looked so delicate and handsome despite that important personal advantage that she went so far as to say looking at him with great complacency from #head# to #foot# that she really didnt think it would have been possible on the longest notice to have made much difference in him for the better
on $mr_brownlow$ calling to him to come in he found himself in a little back #room# quite full of #book# with a #window# looking into some pleasant little gardens
#dear# #heart# alive thus encouraged $oliver_twist$ tapped at the study #door# there was a #table# drawn up before the #window# at which $mr_brownlow$ was seated reading
when he saw $oliver_twist$ he pushed the #book# away from him and told him to come near the #table# and sit down
$oliver_twist$ complied marvelling where the #people# could be found to read such a great number of #book# as seemed to be written to make the world wiser
there are a good many #book# are there not my #boy# said $mr_brownlow$ observing the curiosity with which $oliver_twist$ surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling
which is still a marvel to more experienced #people# than $oliver_twist$ every #day# of their #life# a great number #sir# replied $oliver_twist$
you shall read them if you behave well said the old #gentleman# kindly and you will like that better than looking at the outsides that is some cases because there are #book# of which the backs and covers are by far the best #part#
i suppose they are those heavy #one# #sir# said $oliver_twist$ pointing to some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the binding
said the old #gentleman# patting $oliver_twist$ on the #head# and smiling as he did so there are other equally heavy #one# though of a much smaller size
i never saw so many not always those how should you like to grow up a clever #man# and write #book# eh
i think i would rather read them #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ what wouldnt you like to be a #book# writer said the old #gentleman#
$oliver_twist$ considered a little while and at last said he should think it would be a much better #thing# to be a #book# seller upon which the old #gentleman# laughed heartily and declared he had said a very good #thing#
which $oliver_twist$ felt glad to have done though he by no means knew what it was well well said the old #gentleman# composing his features
dont be afraid we wont make an author of you while there an honest trade to be learnt or brick making to turn to
at the earnest #manner# of his reply the old #gentleman# laughed again and said #something# about a curious instinct which $oliver_twist$ not understanding paid no very great attention to
now said $mr_brownlow$ speaking if possible in a kinder but at the same #time# in a much more serious #manner# than $oliver_twist$ had ever known him assume yet i want you to pay great attention my #boy# to what i am going to say
i shall talk to you without any reserve because i am sure you are well able to understand me as many older #person# would be
oh dont tell you are going to send me away #sir# pray exclaimed $oliver_twist$ alarmed at the serious tone of the old #gentleman# commencement
thank you #sir# said $oliver_twist$ dont turn me out of #door# to wander in the #street# again let me stay here and be a servant
my #dear# #child# said the old #gentleman# moved by the warmth of $oliver_twist$ sudden appeal you need not be afraid of my deserting you unless you give me cause
dont send me back to the wretched #place# i came from have mercy upon a poor #boy# #sir# i never never will #sir# interposed $oliver_twist$
i have been deceived before in the objects whom i have endeavoured to benefit but i feel strongly disposed to trust you nevertheless and i am more interested in your behalf than i can well account for even to myself
the #person# on whom i have bestowed my dearest love lie deep in their graves but although the happiness and delight of my #life# lie buried there too i have not made a coffin of my #heart# and sealed it up forever on my best affections
i hope not rejoined the old #gentleman# i do not think you ever will deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them
as the old #gentleman# said this in a low #voice# more to himself than to his #companion# and as he remained silent for a short #time# afterwards $oliver_twist$ sat quite still
well well said the old #gentleman# at #length# in a more cheerful tone i only say this because you have a young #heart# and knowing that i have suffered great pain and sorrow you will be more careful perhaps not to wound me again
you say you are an orphan without a #friend# in the world all the inquiries i have been able to make confirm the statement
let me hear your story where you come from who brought you up and how you got into the company in which i found you
$oliver_twist$ sobs checked his utterance for some #minute# when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm and carried to the workhouse by $mr_bumble$ a peculiarly impatient little double knock was heard at the #street# #door# and the servant running upstairs announced $mr_grimwig$
speak the truth and you shall not be friendless while i live is he coming up inquired $mr_brownlow$ yes #sir# replied the servant
he asked if there were any muffins in the #house# and when i told him yes he said he had come to tea
$mr_brownlow$ smiled and turning to $oliver_twist$ said that $mr_grimwig$ was an old #friend# of his and he must not #mind# his being a little rough in his #manner# for he was a worthy creature at bottom as he had reason to know
at this #moment# there walked into the #room# supporting himself by a thick stick a stout old #gentleman# rather lame in #one# leg who was dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat nankeen breeches and gaiters and a broad brimmed white #hat# with the #side# turned up with green
a very small plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat and a very long steel watch chain with #nothing# but a key at the end dangled loosely below it
the ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted defy description
he had a #manner# of screwing his #head# on #one# #side# when he spoke and of looking out of the #corner# of his #eye# at the same #time# which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot
in this attitude he fixed himself the #moment# he made his appearance and holding out a small piece of orange peel at #arm# #length# exclaimed in a growling discontented #voice#
shall i go downstairs #sir# inquired $oliver_twist$ no replied $mr_brownlow$ i would rather you remained here #look# here do you see this
isnt it a most wonderful and extraordinary #thing# that i cant call at a #man# #house# but i find a piece of this poor surgeon #friend# on the staircase
i ve been lamed with orange peel once and i know orange peel will be my #death# or i ll be content to eat my own #head# #sir#
this was the handsome offer with which $mr_grimwig$ backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made and it was the more singular in his case because even admitting for the sake of argument the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a #gentleman# to eat his own #head# in the event of his being so disposed $mr_grimwig$ #head# was such a particularly large #one# that the most sanguine #man# alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting to put entirely out of the question a very thick coating of powder
i ll eat my #head# #sir# repeated $mr_grimwig$ striking his stick upon the #ground# hallo what that looking at $oliver_twist$ and retreating a pace or two
you dont mean to say that the #boy# who had the fever i hope said $mr_grimwig$ recoiling a little more
this is young $oliver_twist$ whom we were speaking about said $mr_brownlow$ $oliver_twist$ bowed wait a #minute# dont speak
stop continued $mr_grimwig$ abruptly losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery that the #boy# who had the orange
if that not the #boy# #sir# who had the orange and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase i ll eat my #head# and his too
put down your #hat# and speak to my young #friend# i feel strongly on this subject #sir# said the irritable old #gentleman# drawing off his gloves
there always more or less orange peel on the pavement in our #street# and i know it put there by the surgeon #boy# at the #corner#
no no he has not had #one# said $mr_brownlow$ laughing come a young #woman# stumbled over a bit last #night# and fell against my garden railings directly she got up
i saw her #look# towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime #light# dont go to him i called out of the #window# he an assassin
if he is not here the irascible old #gentleman# gave a great knock on the #ground# with his stick which was always understood by his #friend# to imply the customary offer whenever it was not expressed in #word#
then still keeping his stick in his #hand# he sat down and opening a double #eye# glass which he wore attached to a broad black riband took a view of $oliver_twist$ who seeing that he was the object of inspection coloured and bowed again
a #man# trap so he is that the #boy# is it said $mr_grimwig$ at #length# that the #boy# replied $mr_brownlow$
$mr_brownlow$ seeming to apprehend that his singular #friend# was about to say #something# disagreeable asked $oliver_twist$ to step downstairs and tell $mrs_bedwin$ they were ready for tea which as he did not half like the visitor #manner# he was very happy to do
how are you #boy# said $mr_grimwig$ a great deal better thank you #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ he is a nice looking #boy# is he not inquired $mr_brownlow$
i dont know replied $mr_grimwig$ pettishly dont know no i dont know i never see any difference in #boy#
i know a #friend# who has a beef faced #boy# a fine #boy# they call him with a round #head# and red cheeks and glaring #eye# a horrid #boy# with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes with the #voice# of a pilot and the appetite of a wolf
i only knew two sort of #boy# mealy #boy# and beef faced #boy# and which is $oliver_twist$ mealy i know him
the wretch come said $mr_brownlow$ these are not the characteristics of young $oliver_twist$ so he neednt excite your wrath
they are not replied $mr_grimwig$ he may have worse here $mr_brownlow$ coughed impatiently which appeared to afford $mr_grimwig$ the most exquisite delight
he may have worse i say repeated $mr_grimwig$ where does he come from who is he what is he
he has had a fever what of that fevers are not peculiar to good #people# are they bad #people# have fevers sometimes havent they eh
i knew a #man# who was hung in jamaica for murdering his #master# he had had a fever six #time# he wasnt recommended to mercy on that account
now the fact was that in the inmost recesses of his own #heart# $mr_grimwig$ was strongly disposed to admit that $oliver_twist$ appearance and #manner# were unusually prepossessing but he had a strong appetite for contradiction sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange peel and inwardly determining that no #man# should dictate to him whether a #boy# was well looking or not he had resolved from the first to oppose his #friend#
when $mr_brownlow$ admitted that on no #one# point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer and that he had postponed any investigation into $oliver_twist$ previous history until he #thought# the #boy# was strong enough to hear it $mr_grimwig$ chuckled maliciously
and he demanded with a sneer whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at #night# because if she didnt find a #table# spoon or two missing some sunshiny #morning# why he would be content to and so forth
all this $mr_brownlow$ although himself somewhat of an impetuous #gentleman# knowing his #friend# peculiarities bore with great good humour as $mr_grimwig$ at tea was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins #matter# went on very smoothly and $oliver_twist$ who made #one# of the party began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old #gentleman# presence
and when are you going to hear a full true and particular account of the #life# and adventures of $oliver_twist$
asked $mr_grimwig$ of $mr_brownlow$ at the conclusion of the meal looking sideways at $oliver_twist$ as he resumed his subject
pooh nonsense to morrow #morning# replied $mr_brownlow$ i would rather he was alone with me at the #time# come up to me to morrow #morning# at ten clock my #dear#
yes #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ he answered with some hesitation because he was confused by $mr_grimwig$ looking so hard at him
i ll tell you what whispered that #gentleman# to $mr_brownlow$ he wont come up to you to morrow #morning# i saw him hesitate
he is deceiving you my good #friend# i ll swear he is not replied $mr_brownlow$ warmly if he is not said $mr_grimwig$ i ll and down went the stick
i ll answer for that #boy# truth with my #life# said $mr_brownlow$ knocking the #table# and i for his falsehood with my #head# rejoined $mr_grimwig$ knocking the #table# also
we shall see said $mr_brownlow$ checking his rising anger we will replied $mr_grimwig$ with a provoking smile we will
as fate would have it $mrs_bedwin$ chanced to bring in at this #moment# a small parcel of #book# which $mr_brownlow$ had that #morning# purchased of the identical bookstall keeper who has already figured in this history having laid them on the #table# she prepared to leave the #room#
stop the #boy# $mrs_bedwin$ said $mr_brownlow$ there is #something# to go back he has gone #sir# replied $mrs_bedwin$
call after him said $mr_brownlow$ it particular he is a poor #man# and they are not paid for there are some #book# to be taken back too
$oliver_twist$ ran #one# #way# and the #girl# ran another and $mrs_bedwin$ stood on the step and screamed for the #boy# but there was no #boy# in sight
the #street# #door# was opened $oliver_twist$ and the #girl# returned in a breathless state to report that there were no tidings of him
send $oliver_twist$ with them said $mr_grimwig$ with an ironical smile he will be sure to deliver them safely you know
#dear# me i am very sorry for that exclaimed $mr_brownlow$ i particularly wished those #book# to be returned to #night#
the old #gentleman# was just going to say that $oliver_twist$ should not go out on any account when a most malicious cough from $mr_grimwig$ determined him that he should and that by his prompt discharge of the commission he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions on this #head# at least at once
yes do let me take them if you please #sir# said $oliver_twist$ i ll run all the #way# #sir# you shall go my #dear# said the old #gentleman#
$oliver_twist$ delighted to be of use brought down the #book# under his #arm# in a great bustle and waited cap in #hand# to hear what message he was to take
you are to say said $mr_brownlow$ glancing steadily at $mr_grimwig$ you are to say that you have brought those #book# back and that you have come to pay the four pound ten i owe him
this is a five pound note so you will have to bring me back ten shillings change i wont be ten #minute# #sir# said $oliver_twist$ eagerly
having buttoned up the bank note in his jacket #pocket# and placed the #book# carefully under his #arm# he made a respectful bow and left the #room#
$mrs_bedwin$ followed him to the #street# #door# giving him many directions about the nearest #way# and the #name# of the bookseller and the #name# of the #street# all of which $oliver_twist$ said he clearly understood
having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold the old #lady# at #length# permitted him to depart
the #book# are on a #chair# by my #table# fetch them down bless his sweet #face# said the old #lady# looking after him
i cant bear somehow to let him go out of my sight at this #moment# $oliver_twist$ looked gaily round and nodded before he turned the #corner#
let me see he ll be back in twenty #minute# at the longest said $mr_brownlow$ pulling out his watch and placing it on the #table#
the old #lady# smilingly returned his salutation and closing the #door# went back to her own #room# it will be dark by that #time#
the spirit of contradiction was strong in $mr_grimwig$ breast at the #moment# and it was rendered stronger by his #friend# confident smile
oh you really expect him to come back do you inquired $mr_grimwig$ dont you asked $mr_brownlow$ smiling no he said smiting the #table# with his fist i do not
the #boy# has a new suit of clothes on his back a set of valuable #book# under his #arm# and a five pound note in his #pocket#
he ll join his old #friend# the thieves and laugh at you if ever that #boy# returns to this #house# #sir# i ll eat my #head#
with these #word# he drew his #chair# closer to the #table# and there the two #friend# sat in silent expectation with the watch between them
it is worthy of remark as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions that although $mr_grimwig$ was not by any means a bad hearted #man# and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected #friend# duped and deceived he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that #moment# that $oliver_twist$ might not come back
it grew so dark that the figures on the dial plate were scarcely discernible but there the two old #gentleman# continued to sit in #silence# with the watch between them
in the obscure parlour of a low public #house# in the filthiest #part# of little saffron hill a dark and gloomy den where a flaring gas #light# burnt all #day# in the winter #time# and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer there sat brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor a #man# in a velveteen coat drab shorts half boots and stockings whom even by that dim #light# no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as $mr_william_sikes$
at his #foot# sat a white coated red eyed #dog# who occupied himself alternately in winking at his #master# with both #eye# at the same #time# and in licking a large fresh cut on #one# #side# of his mouth which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict
#chapter# xv showing how very fond of $oliver_twist$ the merry old jew and $miss_nancy$ were keep quiet you warmint
whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the #dog# winking or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them is #matter# for argument and consideration
keep quiet said $mr_william_sikes$ suddenly breaking #silence# whatever was the cause the effect was a kick and a curse bestowed upon the #dog# simultaneously
#dog# are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their #master# but $mr_william_sikes$ #dog# having faults of temper in common with his owner and labouring perhaps at this #moment# under a powerful sense of injury made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in #one# of the half boots
having given in a hearty shake he retired growling under a form just escaping the pewter measure which $mr_william_sikes$ levelled at his #head#
said $mr_william_sikes$ seizing the poker in #one# #hand# and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife which he drew from his #pocket#
the #dog# no doubt heard because $mr_william_sikes$ spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh #voice# but appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut he remained where he was and growled more fiercely than before at the same #time# grasping the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild beast
you would would you come here you born devil come here ye hear this resistance only infuriated $mr_william_sikes$ the more who dropping on his knees began to assail the animal most furiously
the #dog# jumped from right to left and from left to right snapping growling and barking the #man# thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for #one# or other when the #door# suddenly opening the #dog# darted out leaving $bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ with the poker and the clasp knife in his #hand#
$mr_william_sikes$ being disappointed of the #dog# participation at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer
there must always be two parties to a quarrel says the old adage what the devil do you come in between me and my #dog# for said $mr_william_sikes$ with a fierce gesture
i didnt know my #dear# i didnt know replied $mr_fagin$ humbly for the jew was the new comer didnt know you white livered thief growled $mr_william_sikes$
couldnt you hear the noise not a sound of it as i a living #man# $bill_sikes$ replied the jew oh no
you hear #nothing# you dont retorted $mr_william_sikes$ with a fierce sneer sneaking in and out so as nobody hears how you come or go
cause the government as cares for the #life# of such #man# as you as havent half the pluck of curs lets a #man# kill a #dog# how he likes replied $mr_william_sikes$ shutting up the knife with a very expressive #look# that why
i wish you had been the #dog# $mr_fagin$ half a #minute# ago why inquired the jew with a forced smile the jew rubbed his #hand# and sitting down at the #table# affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his #friend#
he was obviously very ill at ease however grin away said $mr_william_sikes$ replacing the poker and surveying him with savage contempt grin away
you ll never have the laugh at me though unless it behind a nightcap i ve got the upper #hand# over you $mr_fagin$ and me i ll keep it
there if i go you go so take care of me well well my #dear# said the jew i know all that we we have a mutual interest $bill_sikes$ a mutual interest
humph said $mr_william_sikes$ as if he #thought# the interest lay rather more on the jew #side# than on his well what have you got to say to me
it rather more than it ought to be my #dear# but as i know you ll do me a good turn another #time# and
it all passed safe through the melting pot replied $mr_fagin$ and this is your share stow that gammon interposed the robber impatiently
where is it #hand# over yes yes $bill_sikes$ give me #time# give me #time# replied the jew soothingly here it is
as he spoke he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast and untying a large knot in #one# #corner# produced a small brown paper packet
all safe $mr_william_sikes$ snatching it from him hastily opened it and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained this is all is it inquired $mr_william_sikes$
all replied the jew you havent opened the parcel and swallowed #one# or two as you come along have you
inquired $mr_william_sikes$ suspiciously dont put on an injured #look# at the question you ve done it many a #time# jerk the tinkler
these #word# in plain english conveyed an injunction to ring the bell it was answered by another jew younger than $mr_fagin$ but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance
the jew perfectly understanding the hint retired to fill it previously exchanging a remarkable #look# with $mr_fagin$ who raised his #eye# for an instant as if in expectation of it and shook his #head# in reply so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third #person#
$bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ merely pointed to the empty measure it was lost upon $mr_william_sikes$ who was stooping at the #moment# to tie the boot lace which the #dog# had torn
possibly if he had observed the brief interchange of signals he might have #thought# that it boded no good to him
is anybody here $barney$ inquired $mr_fagin$ speaking now that that $mr_william_sikes$ was looking on without raising his #eye# from the #ground#
dot a shoul replied $barney$ whose #word# whether they came from the #heart# or not made their #way# through the nose
inquired $mr_fagin$ in a tone of surprise which perhaps might mean that $barney$ was at liberty to tell the truth
nobody dobody but biss dadsy replied $barney$ $miss_nancy$ exclaimed $mr_william_sikes$ where strike me blind if i dont honour that ere #girl# for her native talents
she bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar replied $barney$ send her here said $mr_william_sikes$ pouring out a glass of liquor
$barney$ looked timidly at $mr_fagin$ as if for permission the jew remaining silent and not lifting his #eye# from the #ground# he retired and presently returned ushering in $miss_nancy$ who was decorated with the bonnet apron basket and #street# #door# key complete
send her here you are on the scent are you $miss_nancy$ inquired $mr_william_sikes$ proffering the glass yes i am $bill_sikes$ replied the young #lady# disposing of its contents and tired enough of it i am too
now whether a peculiar contraction of the jew red #eye# brows and a half closing of his deeply set #eye# warned $miss_nancy$ that she was disposed to be too communicative is not a #matter# of much importance
the fact is all we need care for here and the fact is that she suddenly checked herself and with several gracious smiles upon $mr_william_sikes$ turned the conversation to other #matter#
in about ten #minute# #time# $mr_fagin$ was seized with a fit of coughing upon which $miss_nancy$ pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was #time# to go
$mr_william_sikes$ finding that he was walking a short #part# of her #way# himself expressed his intention of accompanying her they went away together followed at a little distant by the #dog# who slunk out of a back yard as soon as his #master# was out of sight
the jew thrust his #head# out of the #room# #door# when $mr_william_sikes$ had left it looked after him as he walked up the dark passage shook his clenched fist muttered a deep curse and then with a horrible grin reseated himself at the #table# where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the hue and cry
meanwhile $oliver_twist$ little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old #gentleman# was on his #way# to the #book# stall
when he got into clerkenwell he accidently turned down a by #street# which was not exactly in his #way# but not discovering his mistake until he had got half #way# down it and knowing it must lead in the right direction he did not think it worth while to turn back and so marched on as quickly as he could with the #book# under his #arm#
he was walking along thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel and how much he would give for only #one# #look# at poor little $dick$ who starved and beaten might be weeping bitterly at that very #moment# when he was startled by a young #woman# screaming out very loud
the young brat been ill and confined to the crib and ah $miss_nancy$ #dear# said $mr_fagin$ looking up oh my #dear# brother
and he had hardly looked up to see what the #matter# was when he was stopped by having a pair of #arm# thrown tight round his neck
the only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from the young #woman# who had embraced him and who had a little basket and a #street# #door# key in her #hand#
dont cried $oliver_twist$ struggling let go of me who is it what are you stopping me for oh my gracious said the young #woman# i have found him
oh $oliver_twist$ $oliver_twist$ oh you naughty #boy# to make me suffer such distress on your account come home #dear# come oh i ve found him
with these incoherent exclamations the young #woman# burst into another fit of crying and got so dreadfully hysterical that a couple of #woman# who came up at the #moment# asked a butcher #boy# with a shiny #head# of hair anointed with suet who was also looking on whether he didnt think he had better run for the #doctor#
to which the butcher #boy# who appeared of a lounging not to say indolent disposition replied that he #thought# not
thank gracious goodness heavins i ve found him oh no no never #mind# said the young #woman# grasping $oliver_twist$ #hand# i better now
oh ma am replied the young #woman# he ran away near a month ago from his parents who are hard working and respectable #people# and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters and almost broke his #mother# #heart#
come home directly you cruel #boy# come young wretch said #one# #woman# go home do you little brute said the other
i am not replied $oliver_twist$ greatly alarmed i dont know her i havent any sister or father and #mother# either
i an orphan i live at pentonville only hear him how he braves it out cried the young #woman#
why it $miss_nancy$ exclaimed $oliver_twist$ who now saw her #face# for the first #time# and started back in irrepressible astonishment
you see he knows me cried $miss_nancy$ appealing to the bystanders he cant help himself make him come home there good #people# or he ll kill his #dear# #mother# and father and break my #heart#
what the devil this said a #man# bursting out of a beer shop with a white #dog# at his heels young $oliver_twist$
come home to your poor #mother# you young #dog# come home directly i dont belong to them i dont know them
help help cried $oliver_twist$ struggling in the #man# powerful grasp help repeated the #man# yes i ll help you you young rascal
what #book# are these you ve been a stealing em have you give em here with these #word# the #man# tore the volumes from his grasp and struck him on the #head#
that right cried a looker on from a garret #window# that the only #way# of bringing him to his senses to be sure cried a sleepy faced carpenter casting an approving #look# at the garret #window#
it ll do him good said the two #woman# and he shall have it too rejoined the #man# administering another blow and seizing $oliver_twist$ by the collar
weak with recent illness stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack terrified by the fierce growling of the #dog# and the brutality of the #man# overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be what could #one# poor #child# do
come on you young villain here bull #eye# #mind# him #boy# #mind# him darkness had set in it was a low neighborhood no help was near resistance was useless
in another #moment# he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to unintelligible
it was of little #moment# indeed whether they were intelligible or no for there was nobody to care for them had they been ever so plain
the gas lamps were lighted $mrs_bedwin$ was waiting anxiously at the open #door# the servant had run up the #street# twenty #time# to see if there were any traces of $oliver_twist$ and still the two old #gentleman# sat perseveringly in the dark parlour with the watch between them
the narrow #street# and courts at #length# terminated in a large open space scattered about which were pens for beasts and other indications of a cattle market
$mr_william_sikes$ slackened his pace when they reached this spot the #girl# being quite unable to support any longer the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked
#chapter# xvi relates what became of $oliver_twist$ after he had been claimed by $miss_nancy$ turning to $oliver_twist$ he roughly commanded him to take hold of $miss_nancy$ #hand#
do you hear growled $mr_william_sikes$ as $oliver_twist$ hesitated and looked round they were in a dark #corner# quite out of the track of passengers
$oliver_twist$ saw but too plainly that resistance would be of no avail he held out his #hand# which $miss_nancy$ clasped tight in hers
see here #boy# said $mr_william_sikes$ putting his other #hand# to $oliver_twist$ throat if he speaks ever so soft a #word# hold him
give me the other said $mr_william_sikes$ seizing $oliver_twist$ unoccupied #hand# here bull #eye# the #dog# looked up and growled ye #mind#
the #dog# growled again and licking his lips eyed $oliver_twist$ as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay
he as willing as a christian strike me blind if he isnt said $mr_william_sikes$ regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval
now you know what you ve got to expect #master# so call away as quick as you like the #dog# will soon stop that game
bull #eye# wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech and giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of $oliver_twist$ led the #way# onward
it was smithfield that they were crossing although it might have been grosvenor square for #anything# $oliver_twist$ knew to the contrary
the #light# in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist which thickened every #moment# and shrouded the #street# and #house# in gloom rendering the strange #place# still stranger in $oliver_twist$ #eye# and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing
get on young un the #night# was dark and foggy they had hurried on a few paces when a deep church bell struck the #hour#
with its first stroke his two conductors stopped and turned their #head# in the direction whence the sound proceeded eight clock $bill_sikes$ said $miss_nancy$ when the bell ceased
what the good of telling me that i can hear it cant i replied $mr_william_sikes$ i wonder whether they can hear it said $miss_nancy$
it was bartlemy #time# when i was shopped and there warnt a penny trumpet in the fair as i couldnt hear the squeaking on
arter i was locked up for the #night# the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent that i could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the #door#
of course they can replied $mr_william_sikes$ poor fellow said $miss_nancy$ who still had her #face# turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded
oh $bill_sikes$ such fine young chaps as them yes that all you #woman# think of answered $mr_william_sikes$ fine young chaps
with this consolation $mr_william_sikes$ appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy and clasping $oliver_twist$ wrist more firmly told him to step out again
wait a #minute# said the #girl# i wouldnt hurry by if it was you that was coming out to be hung the next #time# eight clock struck $bill_sikes$
i walk round and round the #place# till i dropped if the snow was on the #ground# and i hadnt a shawl to cover me
well they re as good as dead so it dont much #matter# and what good would that do inquired the unsentimental $mr_william_sikes$
unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope you might as well be walking fifty mile off or not walking at all for all the good it would do me
come on and dont stand preaching there the #girl# burst into a laugh drew her shawl more closely round her and they walked away
but $oliver_twist$ felt her #hand# tremble and looking up in her #face# as they passed a gas lamp saw that it had turned a deadly white
they walked on by little frequented and dirty #way# for a full half #hour# meeting very few #people# and those appearing from their #look# to hold much the same position in society as $mr_william_sikes$ himself
at #length# they turned into a very filthy narrow #street# nearly full of old clothes shops the #dog# running forward as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the #door# of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted the #house# was in a ruinous condition and on the #door# was nailed a board intimating that it was to let which looked as if it had hung there for many #year#
all right cried $mr_william_sikes$ glancing cautiously about $miss_nancy$ stooped below the shutters and $oliver_twist$ heard the sound of a bell they crossed to the opposite #side# of the #street# and stood for a few #moment# under a lamp
$mr_william_sikes$ then seized the terrified #boy# by the collar with very little ceremony and all three were quickly inside the #house#
a noise as if a sash #window# were gently raised was heard and soon afterwards the #door# softly opened the passage was perfectly dark
they waited while the #person# who had let them in chained and barred the #door# anybody here inquired $mr_william_sikes$
no replied a #voice# which $oliver_twist$ #thought# he had heard before is the old un here asked the robber
yes replied the #voice# and precious down in the mouth he has been wont he be glad to see you oh no
the style of this reply as well as the #voice# which delivered it seemed familiar to $oliver_twist$ ears but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness
let have a glim said $mr_william_sikes$ or we shall go breaking our necks or treading on the #dog# #look# after your legs if you do
the receding footsteps of the speaker were heard and in another #minute# the form of $mr_john_dawkins$ otherwise the artful dodger appeared
stand still a #moment# and i ll get you #one# replied the #voice# he bore in his right #hand# a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick
the young #gentleman# did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon $oliver_twist$ than a humourous grin but turning away beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs
they crossed an empty kitchen and opening the #door# of a low earthy smelling #room# which seemed to have been built in a small back yard were received with a shout of laughter
oh my wig my wig cried #master# charles $charley_bates$ from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded here he is oh cry here he is
oh $mr_fagin$ #look# at him $mr_fagin$ do #look# at him i cant bear it it is such a jolly game i cant bear it
with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth #master# $charley_bates$ laid himself flat on the floor and kicked convulsively for five #minute# in an ectasy of facetious joy
then jumping to his #foot# he snatched the cleft stick from the dodger and advancing to $oliver_twist$ viewed him round and round while the jew taking off his nightcap made a great number of low bows to the bewildered #boy#
the artful meantime who was of a rather saturnine disposition and seldom gave #way# to merriment when it interfered with business rifled $oliver_twist$ #pocket# with steady assiduity
#look# at his togs $mr_fagin$ said $charley_bates$ putting the #light# so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on #fire#
hold me somebody while i laugh it out #look# at his togs superfine cloth and the heavy swell cut oh my #eye# what a game
and his #book# too #nothing# but a #gentleman# $mr_fagin$ delighted to see you looking so well my #dear# said the jew bowing with mock humility
the artful shall give you another suit my #dear# for fear you should spoil that sunday #one# why didnt you write my #dear# and say you were coming
at his #master# $charley_bates$ roared again so loud that $mr_fagin$ himself relaxed and even the dodger smiled but as the artful drew forth the five pound note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment
we have got #something# warm for supper hallo what that inquired $mr_william_sikes$ stepping forward as the jew seized the note
that mine $mr_fagin$ no no my #dear# said the jew mine $bill_sikes$ mine you shall have the #book#
if that aint mine said $bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ putting on his #hat# with a determined #air# mine and $miss_nancy$ that is i ll take the #boy# back again
$oliver_twist$ started too though from a very different cause for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back
the jew started come #hand# over will you said $mr_william_sikes$ this is hardly fair $bill_sikes$ hardly fair is it $miss_nancy$ inquired the jew
do you think $miss_nancy$ and me has got #nothing# else to do with our precious #time# but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young #boy# as gets grabbed through you
fair or not fair retorted $mr_william_sikes$ #hand# over i tell you give it here you avaricious old skeleton give it here
with this gentle remonstrance $mr_william_sikes$ plucked the note from between the jew finger and thumb and looking the old #man# coolly in the #face# folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief
that for our share of the trouble said $mr_william_sikes$ and not half enough neither you may keep the #book# if you re fond of reading
they re very pretty said $charley_bates$ who with sundry grimaces had been affecting to read #one# of the volumes in question beautiful writing isnt is $oliver_twist$
at sight of the dismayed #look# with which $oliver_twist$ regarded his tormentors #master# $charley_bates$ who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous fell into another ectasy more boisterous than the first
they belong to the old #gentleman# said $oliver_twist$ wringing his #hand# to the good kind old #gentleman# who took me into his #house# and had me nursed when i was near dying of the fever
if you aint sell em oh pray send them back send him back the #book# and money keep me here all my #life# long but pray pray send them back
he ll think i stole them the old #lady# all of them who were so kind to me will think i stole them
with these #word# which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief $oliver_twist$ fell upon his knees at the jew #foot# and beat his #hand# together in perfect desperation
oh do have mercy upon me and send them back the #boy# right remarked $mr_fagin$ looking covertly round and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot
you re right $oliver_twist$ you re right they will think you have stolen em ha ha chuckled the jew rubbing his #hand# it couldnt have happened better if we had chosen our #time#
of course it couldnt replied $mr_william_sikes$ i know that directly i see him coming through clerkenwell with the #book# under his #arm#
they re soft hearted psalm singers or they wouldnt have taken him in at all and they ll ask no questions after him fear they should be obliged to prosecute and so get him lagged
$oliver_twist$ had looked from #one# to the other while these #word# were being spoken as if he were bewildered and could scarecely understand what passed but when $bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ concluded he jumped suddenly to his #foot# and tore wildly from the #room# uttering shrieks for help which made the bare old #house# echo to the roof
cried $miss_nancy$ springing before the #door# and closing it as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit
it all right enough he safe enough keep back the #dog# $bill_sikes$ keep back the #dog# he ll #tear# the #boy# to pieces serve him right
cried $mr_william_sikes$ struggling to disengage himself from the #girl# grasp stand off from me or i ll split your #head# against the wall
i dont care for that $bill_sikes$ i dont care for that screamed the #girl# struggling violently with the #man# the #child# shant be torn down by the #dog# unless you kill me first
the housebreaker flung the #girl# from him to the further end of the #room# just as the jew and the two #boy# returned dragging $oliver_twist$ among them
shant he said $mr_william_sikes$ setting his teeth i ll soon do that if you dont keep off what the #matter# here
said $mr_fagin$ looking round the #girl# gone mad i think replied $mr_william_sikes$ savagely no she hasnt said $miss_nancy$ pale and breathless from the scuffle no she hasnt $mr_fagin$ dont think it
then keep quiet will you said the jew with a threatening #look# no i wont do that neither replied $miss_nancy$ speaking very loud
$mr_fagin$ was sufficiently well acquainted with the #manner# and customs of that particular species of humanity to which $miss_nancy$ belonged to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her at present
come what do you think of that with the view of diverting the attention of the company he turned to $oliver_twist$
so you wanted to get away my #dear# did you said the jew taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a #corner# of the fireplace eh
$oliver_twist$ made no reply but he watched the jew motions and breathed quickly wanted to get assistance called for the police did you
the jew inflicted a smart blow on $oliver_twist$ shoulders with the club and was raising it for a second when the #girl# rushing forward wrested it from his #hand#
she flung it into the #fire# with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the #room#
sneered the jew catching the #boy# by the #arm# we ll cure you of that my young #master# i wont stand by and see it done $mr_fagin$ cried the #girl#
him be let him be or i shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows before my #time#
the #girl# stamped her #foot# violently on the floor as she vented this threat and with her lips compressed and her #hand# clenched looked alternately at the jew and the other robber
you ve got the #boy# and what more would you have let her #face# quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself
why $miss_nancy$ said the jew in a soothing tone after a pause during which he and $mr_william_sikes$ had stared at #one# another in a disconcerted #manner# you you re more clever than ever to #night#
you will be the worse for it $mr_fagin$ if i do and so i tell you in good #time# to keep clear of me
there is #something# about a roused #woman# especially if she add to all her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair which few #man# like to provoke
the jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of $miss_nancy$ rage and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a glance half imploring and half cowardly at $mr_william_sikes$ as if to hint that he was the fittest #person# to pursue the dialogue
$mr_william_sikes$ thus mutely appealed to and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of $miss_nancy$ to reason gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention
as they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged however he resorted to more tangible arguments
what do you mean by this said $mr_william_sikes$ backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand #time# that it is uttered below would render blindness as common a disorder as measles what do you mean by it
ha ha my #dear# you are acting beautifully am i said the #girl# take care i dont overdo it burn my body
oh yes i know all about it replied the #girl# laughing hysterically and shaking her #head# from #side# to #side# with a poor assumption of indifference
well then keep quiet rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his #dog# or i ll quiet you for a good long #time# to come
the #girl# laughed again even less composedly than before and darting a hasty #look# at $mr_william_sikes$ turned her #face# aside and bit her lip till the blood came
you re a nice #one# added $mr_william_sikes$ as he surveyed her with a contemptuous #air# to take up the humane and gen teel #side#
do you know who you are and what you are a pretty subject for the #child# as you call him to make a #friend# of
cried the #girl# passionately and i wish i had been struck dead in the #street# or had changed #place# with them
god almighty help me i am we passed so near to #night# before i had lent a #hand# in bringing him here
isnt that enough for the old wretch without blows come come $mr_william_sikes$ said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone and motioning towards the #boy# who were eagerly attentive to all that passed we must have civil #word# civil #word# $bill_sikes$ civil #word#
he a thief a liar a devil all that bad from this #night# forth cried the #girl# whose passion was frightful to see
civil #word# you villain yes you deserve em from me i thieved for you when i was a #child# not half as old as this pointing to $oliver_twist$
i have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve #year# since dont you know it speak out
dont you know it well well replied the jew with an attempt at pacification and if you have it your living
aye it is returned the #girl# not speaking but pouring out the #word# in #one# continuous and vehement scream
it is my living and the cold wet dirty #street# are my home and you re the wretch that drove me to them long ago and that ll keep me there #day# and #night# #day# and #night# till i die
i shall do you a mischief interposed the jew goaded by these reproaches a mischief worse than that if you say much more
the #girl# said #nothing# more but tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion made such a rush at the jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been seized by $mr_william_sikes$ at the right #moment# upon which she made a few ineffectual struggles and fainted
she all right now said $mr_william_sikes$ laying her down in a #corner# she uncommon strong in the #arm# when she up in this #way#
the jew wiped his forehead and smiled as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over but neither he nor $mr_william_sikes$ nor the #dog# nor the #boy# seemed to consider it in any other #light# than a common occurance incidental to business
it the worst of having to do with #woman# said the jew replacing his club but they re clever and we cant get on in our line without em
$charley_bates$ show $oliver_twist$ to #bed# i suppose he better not wear his best clothes tomorrow $mr_fagin$ had he inquired $charley_bates$
#master# $charley_bates$ apparently much delighted with his commission took the cleft stick and led $oliver_twist$ into an adjacent kitchen where there were two or three of the #bed# on which he had slept before and here with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter he produced the identical old suit of clothes which $oliver_twist$ had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at $mr_brownlow$ and the accidental display of which to $mr_fagin$ by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue received of his whereabout
certainly not replied the jew reciprocating the grin with which $charley_bates$ put the question put off the smart #one# said $charley_bates$ and i ll give em to $mr_fagin$ to take care of
#master# $charley_bates$ rolling up the new clothes under his #arm# departed from the #room# leaving $oliver_twist$ in the dark and locking the #door# behind him
the noise of $charley_bates$ laughter and the #voice# of miss betsy who opportunely arrived to throw #water# over her #friend# and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery might have kept many #people# awake under more happy circumstances than those in which $oliver_twist$ was placed
what fun it is poor $oliver_twist$ unwillingly complied but he was sick and weary and he soon fell sound asleep #chapter# xvii
it is the custom on the stage in all good murderous melodramas to present the tragic and the comic scenes in as regular alternation as the layers of red and white in a #side# of streaky bacon
the hero sinks upon his straw #bed# weighed down by fetters and misfortunes in the next scene his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song
we behold with throbbing bosoms the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron her virtue and her #life# alike in danger drawing forth her dagger to preserve the #one# at the cost of the other and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch a whistle is heard and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle where a grey headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals who are free of all sorts of #place# from church vaults to palaces and roam about in company carolling perpetually
$oliver_twist$ destiny continuing unpropitious brings a great #man# to london to injure his reputation such changes appear absurd but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight
the transitions in real #life# from well spread boards to #death# #bed# and from mourning weeds to holiday garments are not a whit less startling only there we are busy actors instead of passive lookers on which makes a vast difference
the actors in the mimic #life# of the theatre are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling which presented before the #eye# of mere spectators are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous
as sudden shiftings of the scene and rapid changes of #time# and #place# are not only sanctioned in #book# by long usage but are by many considered as the great art of authorship an author skill in his craft being by such critics chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every #chapter# this brief introduction to the present #one# may perhaps be deemed unnecessary
if so let it be considered a delicate intimation on the #part# of the historian that he is going back to the town in which $oliver_twist$ was born the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition
$mr_bumble$ emerged at early #morning# from the workhouse gate and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps up the high #street#
he was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood his cocked #hat# and coat were dazzling in the #morning# sun he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power
there was an abstraction in his #eye# an elevation in his #air# which might have warned an observant stranger that #thought# were passing in the #beadle# #mind# too great for utterance
$mr_bumble$ stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him deferentially as he passed along
he merely returned their salutations with a wave of his #hand# and relaxed not in his dignified pace until he reached the farm where $mrs_mann$ tended the infant paupers with parochial care
$mr_bumble$ always carried his #head# high but this #morning# it was higher than usual drat that #beadle# said $mrs_mann$ hearing the well known shaking at the garden gate
if it isnt him at this #time# in the #morning# lauk $mr_bumble$ only think of its being you well #dear# me it is a pleasure this is
the first sentence was addressed to susan and the exclamations of delight were uttered to $mr_bumble$ as the good #lady# unlocked the garden gate and showed him with great attention and respect into the #house#
$mrs_mann$ said $mr_bumble$ not sitting upon or dropping himself into a seat as any common jackanapes would but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a #chair# $mrs_mann$ ma am good #morning#
come into the parlour #sir# please well and good #morning# to you #sir# replied $mrs_mann$ with many smiles
and hoping you find yourself well #sir# so so $mrs_mann$ replied the #beadle# a porochial #life# is not a #bed# of roses $mrs_mann$
ah that it isnt indeed $mr_bumble$ rejoined the #lady# and all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety if they had heard it
a porochial #life# ma am continued $mr_bumble$ striking the #table# with his cane is a #life# of worrit and vexation and hardihood but all public characters as i may say must suffer prosecution
$mrs_mann$ not very well knowing what the #beadle# meant raised her #hand# with a #look# of sympathy and sighed
finding she had done right $mrs_mann$ sighed again evidently to the satisfaction of the public character who repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked #hat# said $mrs_mann$ i am going to london
ah you may well sigh $mrs_mann$ said the #beadle# lauk $mr_bumble$ cried $mrs_mann$ starting back to london ma am resumed the inflexible #beadle# by coach
a legal action is a coming on about a settlement and the board has appointed me me $mrs_mann$ to dispose to the #matter# before the quarter sessions at clerkinwell
and i very much question added $mr_bumble$ drawing himself up whether the clerkinwell sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me
the clerkinwell sessions have brought it upon themselves ma am replied $mr_bumble$ and if the clerkinwell sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected the clerkinwell sessions have only themselves to thank
there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing #manner# in which $mr_bumble$ delivered himself of these #word# that $mrs_mann$ appeared quite awed by them
i and two paupers $mrs_mann$ oh you mustnt be too hard upon them #sir# said $mrs_mann$ coaxingly at #length# she said you re going by coach #sir#
i #thought# it was always usual to send them paupers in carts that when they re ill $mrs_mann$ said the #beadle#
we put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather to prevent their taking cold oh said $mrs_mann$
they are both in a very low state and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury em that is if we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to do if they dont die upon the road to spite us
the opposition coach contracts for these two and takes them cheap said $mr_bumble$ ha ha ha when $mr_bumble$ had laughed a little while his #eye# again encountered the cocked #hat# and he became grave
$mr_bumble$ produced some silver money rolled up in paper from his #pocket# #book# and requested a receipt which $mrs_mann$ wrote
we are forgetting business ma am said the #beadle# here is your porochial stipend for the month it very much blotted #sir# said the farmer of infants
but it formal enough i dare say thank you $mr_bumble$ #sir# i am very much obliged to you i sure
$mr_bumble$ nodded blandly in acknowledgment of $mrs_mann$ curtsey and inquired how the #child# were bless their #dear# little #heart# said $mrs_mann$ with emotion they re as well as can be the #dear#
of course except the two that died last week and little $dick$ isnt that #boy# no better inquired $mr_bumble$ $mrs_mann$ shook her #head#
he a ill conditioned wicious bad disposed porochial #child# that said $mr_bumble$ angrily where is he i ll bring him to you in #one# #minute# #sir# replied $mrs_mann$
having had his #face# put under the pump and dried upon $mrs_mann$ gown he was led into the awful presence of $mr_bumble$ the #beadle#
here you $dick$ after some calling $dick$ was discovered the #child# was pale and thin his cheeks were sunken and his #eye# large and bright
the scanty parish dress the livery of his misery hung loosely on his feeble body and his young limbs had wasted away like those of an old #man#
such was the little being who stood trembling beneath $mr_bumble$ glance not daring to lift his #eye# from the floor and dreading even to hear the #beadle# #voice#
cant you #look# at the #gentleman# you obstinate #boy# said $mrs_mann$ the #child# meekly raised his #eye# and encountered those of $mr_bumble$
what the #matter# with you porochial $dick$ inquired $mr_bumble$ with well timed jocularity #nothing# #sir# replied the #child# faintly
i should think not said $mrs_mann$ who had of course laughed very much at $mr_bumble$ humour you want for #nothing# i sure
i should like faltered the #child# hey #day# interposed mr mann i suppose you re going to say that you do want for #something# now
like what #sir# eh i should like faltered the #child# if somebody that can write would put a few #word# down for me on a piece of paper and fold it up and seal it and keep it for me after i am laid in the #ground# why what does the #boy# mean exclaimed $mr_bumble$ on whom the earnest #manner# and wan aspect of the #child# had made some impression
why you little wretch stop $mrs_mann$ stop said the #beadle# raising his #hand# with a show of authority accustomed as he was to such #thing#
what do you mean #sir# i should like said the #child# to leave my #dear# love to poor $oliver_twist$ and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark #night# with nobody to help him
and i should like to tell him said the #child# pressing his small #hand# together and speaking with great fervour that i was glad to die when i was very young
for perhaps if i had lived to be a #man# and had grown old my little sister who is in heaven might forget me or be unlike me and it would be so much happier if we were both #child# there together
$mr_bumble$ surveyed the little speaker from #head# to #foot# with indescribable astonishment and turning to his #companion# said they re all in #one# story $mrs_mann$
that out dacious $oliver_twist$ had demogalized them all i couldnt have believed it #sir# said $mrs_mann$ holding up her #hand# and looking malignantly at $dick$
i never see such a hardened little wretch take him away ma am said $mr_bumble$ imperiously this must be stated to the board $mrs_mann$
i hope the #gentleman# will understand that it isnt my fault #sir# said $mrs_mann$ whimpering pathetically they shall understand that ma am they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case said $mr_bumble$
there take him away i cant bear the sight on him $dick$ was immediately taken away and locked up in the coal cellar
at six clock next #morning# $mr_bumble$ having exchanged his cocked #hat# for a round #one# and encased his #person# in a blue great coat with a cape to it took his #place# on the outside of the coach accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed with whom in due course of #time# he arrived in london
he experienced no other crosses on the #way# than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers who persisted in shivering and complaining of the cold in a #manner# which $mr_bumble$ declared caused his teeth to chatter in his #head# and made him feel quite uncomfortable although he had a great coat on
having disposed of these evil minded #person# for the #night# $mr_bumble$ sat himself down in the #house# at which the coach stopped and took a temperate dinner of steaks oyster sauce and porter
putting a glass of hot gin and #water# on the chimney piece he drew his #chair# to the #fire# and with sundry moral reflections on the too prevalent sin of discontent and complaining composed himself to read the paper
$mr_bumble$ shortly afterwards took himself off to prepare for his journey the very first paragraph upon which $mr_bumble$ #eye# rested was the following advertisement
whereas a young #boy# named $oliver_twist$ absconded or was enticed on thursday evening last from his home at pentonville and has not since been heard of
the above reward will be paid to any #person# who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said $oliver_twist$ or tend to throw any #light# upon his previous history in which the advertiser is for many reasons warmly interested
and then followed a full description of $oliver_twist$ dress #person# appearance and disappearance with the #name# and address of $mr_brownlow$ at full #length#
$mr_bumble$ opened his #eye# read the advertisement slowly and carefully three several #time# and in #something# more than five #minute# was on his #way# to pentonville having actually in his excitement left the glass of hot gin and #water# untasted
to this inquiry the #girl# returned the not uncommon but rather evasive reply of i dont know where do you come from
$mr_bumble$ no sooner uttered $oliver_twist$ #name# in explanation of his errand than $mrs_bedwin$ who had been listening at the parlour #door# hastened into the passage in a breathless state
five guineas reward is $mr_brownlow$ at home inquired $mr_bumble$ of the #girl# who opened the #door# come in come in said the old #lady#
i knew we should hear of him poor #dear# i knew we should i was certain of it bless his #heart#
having heard this the worthy old #lady# hurried back into the parlour again and seating herself on a sofa burst into #tear#
the #girl# who was not quite so susceptible had run upstairs meanwhile and now returned with a request that $mr_bumble$ would follow her immediately which he did
he was shown into the little back study where sat $mr_brownlow$ and his #friend# $mr_grimwig$ with decanters and glasses before them
i said so all along the latter #gentleman# at once burst into the exclamation a #beadle# a parish #beadle# or i ll eat my #head#
pray dont interrupt just now said $mr_brownlow$ take a seat will you $mr_bumble$ sat himself down quite confounded by the oddity of $mr_grimwig$ #manner#
$mr_brownlow$ moved the lamp so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the #beadle# countenance and said with a little impatience now #sir# you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement
yes #sir# said $mr_bumble$ and you are a #beadle# are you not inquired $mr_grimwig$ i am a porochial #beadle# #gentleman# rejoined $mr_bumble$ proudly
$mr_brownlow$ gently shook his #head# to impose #silence# on his #friend# and resumed do you know where this poor #boy# is now
of course observed $mr_grimwig$ aside to his #friend# i knew he was a #beadle# all over no more than nobody replied $mr_bumble$
well what do you know of him inquired the old #gentleman# speak out my #friend# if you have #anything# to say
you dont happen to know any good of him do you said $mr_grimwig$ caustically after an attentive perusal of $mr_bumble$ features
what do you know of him $mr_bumble$ catching at the inquiry very quickly shook his #head# with portentous solemnity
$mr_brownlow$ looked apprehensively at $mr_bumble$ pursed up countenance and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding $oliver_twist$ in as few #word# as possible
$mr_bumble$ put down his #hat# unbuttoned his coat folded his #arm# inclined his #head# in a retrospective #manner# and after a few #moment# reflection commenced his story
it would be tedious if given in the #beadle# #word# occupying as it did some twenty #minute# in the telling but the sum and substance of it was that $oliver_twist$ was a foundling born of low and vicious parents
you see said $mr_grimwig$ looking triumphantly at $mr_brownlow$ that he had from his birth displayed no better qualities than treachery ingratitude and malice
that he had terminated his brief career in the #place# of his birth by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad and running away in the #night# #time# from his #master# #house#
in proof of his really being the #person# he represented himself $mr_bumble$ laid upon the #table# the papers he had brought to town
folding his #arm# again he then awaited $mr_brownlow$ observations i fear it is all too true said the old #gentleman# sorrowfully after looking over the papers
this is not much for your intelligence but i would gladly have given you treble the money if it had been favourable to the #boy#
it is not improbable that if $mr_bumble$ had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history
it was too late to do it now however so he shook his #head# gravely and pocketing the five guineas withdrew
$mr_brownlow$ paced the #room# to and fro for some #minute# evidently so much disturbed by the #beadle# tale that even $mr_grimwig$ forbore to vex him further
at #length# he stopped and rang the bell violently $mrs_bedwin$ said $mr_brownlow$ when the housekeeper appeared that #boy# $oliver_twist$ is an imposter
it cant be #sir# it cannot be said the old #lady# energetically i tell you he is retorted the old #gentleman#
we have just heard a full account of him from his birth and he has been a thorough paced little villain all his #life#
what do you mean by cant be i never will believe it #sir# replied the old #lady# firmly never
you old #woman# never believe #anything# but quack #doctor# and lying story #book# growled $mr_grimwig$ i knew it all along
why didnt you take my advise in the beginning you would if he hadnt had a fever i suppose eh he was interesting wasnt he
interesting bah and $mr_grimwig$ poked the #fire# with a flourish he was a #dear# grateful gentle #child# #sir# retorted $mrs_bedwin$ indignantly
i know what #child# are #sir# and have done these forty #year# and #people# who cant say the same shouldnt say #anything# about them
as it extorted #nothing# from that #gentleman# but a smile the old #lady# tossed her #head# and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech when she was stopped by $mr_brownlow$
that my opinion this was a hard hit at $mr_grimwig$ who was a bachelor #silence# said the old #gentleman# feigning an anger he was far from feeling
never let me hear the #boy# #name# again i rang to tell you that never never on any pretence #mind# you may leave the #room# $mrs_bedwin$
when he #thought# of his good #friend# it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard or it might have broken outright
remember i am in earnest there were sad #heart# at $mr_brownlow$ that #night# $oliver_twist$ #heart# sank within him #chapter# xviii
when the dodger and #master# $charley_bates$ had gone out to pursue their customary avocations $mr_fagin$ took the opportunity of reading $oliver_twist$ a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary extent in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious #friend# and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery
$mr_fagin$ laid great stress on the fact of his having taken $oliver_twist$ in and cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished with hunger and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be hanged at the old bailey #one# #morning#
$mr_fagin$ did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe but lamented with #tear# in his #eye# that the wrong headed and treacherous behaviour of the young #person# in question had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown which if it were not precisely true was indispensably necessary for the safety of him $mr_fagin$ and a few select #friend#
$mr_fagin$ concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging and with great friendliness and politeness of #manner# expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit $oliver_twist$ to that unpleasant operation
little $oliver_twist$ blood ran cold as he listened to the jew #word# and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them
that it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship he knew already and that deeply laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over communicative #person# had been really devised and carried out by the jew on more occasions than #one# he #thought# by no means unlikely when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that #gentleman# and $mr_william_sikes$ which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind
as he glanced timidly up and met the jew searching #look# he felt that his pale #face# and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old #gentleman#
the jew smiling hideously patted $oliver_twist$ on the #head# and said that if he kept himself quiet and applied himself to business he saw they would be very good #friend# yet
then taking his #hat# and covering himself with an old patched great coat he went out and locked the #room# #door# behind him
and so $oliver_twist$ remained all that #day# and for the greater #part# of many subsequent #day# seeing nobody between early #morning# and midnight and left during the long #hour# to commune with his own #thought#
which never failing to revert to his kind #friend# and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him were sad indeed
after the lapse of a week or so the jew left the #room# #door# unlocked and he was at liberty to wander about the #house#
how $oliver_twist$ passed his #time# in the improving society of his reputable #friend# about noon next #day# it was a very dirty #place#
the #room# upstairs had great high wooden chimney pieces and large #door# with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling which although they were black with neglect and dust were ornamented in various #way#
from all of these tokens $oliver_twist$ concluded that a long #time# ago before the old jew was born it had belonged to better #people# and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome dismal and dreary as it looked now
spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings and sometimes when $oliver_twist$ walked softly into a #room# the mice would scamper across the floor and run back terrified to their holes
with these exceptions there was neither sight nor sound of any living #thing# and often when it grew dark and he was tired of wandering from #room# to #room# he would crouch in the #corner# of the passage by the #street# #door# to be as near living #people# as he could and would remain there listening and counting the #hour# until the jew or the #boy# returned
in all the #room# the mouldering shutters were fast closed the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood the only #light# which was admitted stealing its #way# through round holes at the top which made the #room# more gloomy and filled them with strange shadows
there was a back garret #window# with rusty bars outside which had no shutter and out of this $oliver_twist$ often gazed with a melancholy #face# for #hour# together but #nothing# was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops blackened chimneys and gable ends
sometimes indeed a grizzly #head# might be seen peering over the parapet wall of a distant #house# but it was quickly withdrawn again and as the #window# of $oliver_twist$ observatory was nailed down and dimmed with the rain and smoke of #year# it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond without making any attempt to be seen or heard which
#one# afternoon the dodger and #master# $charley_bates$ being engaged out that evening the first named young #gentleman# took it into his #head# to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his #person# to do him justice this was by no means an habitual weakness with him and with this end and aim he condescendingly commanded $oliver_twist$ to assist him in his toilet straightway
$oliver_twist$ was but too glad to make himself useful too happy to have some #face# however bad to #look# upon too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so to throw any objection in the #way# of this proposal
so he at once expressed his readiness and kneeling on the floor while the dodger sat upon the #table# so that he could take his #foot# in his laps he applied himself to a process which $mr_john_dawkins$ designated as japanning his trotter cases
he had as much chance of being as if he had lived inside the ball of st paul cathedral the phrase rendered into plain english signifieth cleaning his boots
whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a #table# in an easy attitude smoking a pipe swinging #one# leg carelessly to and fro and having his boots cleaned all the #time# without even the past trouble of having taken them off or the prospective misery of putting them on to disturb his reflections or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the dodger or the mildness of the beer that mollified his #thought# he was evidently tinctured for the nonce with a spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature
he looked down on $oliver_twist$ with a thoughtful countenance for a brief space and then raising his #head# and heaving a gentle sign said half in abstraction and half to #master# $charley_bates$ what a pity it is he isnt a prig
ah said #master# charles $charley_bates$ he dont know what good for him the dodger sighed again and resumed his pipe as did $charley_bates$
they both smoked for some seconds in #silence# i suppose you dont even know what a prig is said the dodger mournfully
i think i know that replied $oliver_twist$ looking up it a the you re #one# are you not inquired $oliver_twist$ checking himself
$mr_john_dawkins$ gave his #hat# a ferocious cock after delivering this sentiment and looked at #master# $charley_bates$ as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying #anything# to the contrary
i am replied the dodger i scorn to be #anything# else i am repeated the dodger so $charley_bates$ so $mr_fagin$
so $mr_william_sikes$ so $miss_nancy$ so bet so we all are down to the #dog# and he the downiest #one# of the lot
he wouldnt so much as bark in a witness box for fear of committing himself no not if you tied him up in #one# and left him there without wittles for a fortnight said the dodger
and the least given to peaching added $charley_bates$ not a bit of it observed $charley_bates$ he a rum #dog#
dont he #look# fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he in company pursued the dodger wont he growl at all when he hears a fiddle playing
and dont he hate other #dog# as aint of his breed oh no he an out and out christian said $charley_bates$ this was merely intended as a tribute to the animal abilities but it was an appropriate remark in another sense
if #master# $charley_bates$ had only known it for there are a good many #lady# and #gentleman# claiming to be out and out christians between whom and
well well said the dodger recurring to the point from which they had strayed with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings
$mr_william_sikes$ #dog# there exist strong and singular points of resemblance this hasnt go #anything# to do with young green here
no more it has said $charley_bates$ why dont you put yourself under $mr_fagin$ $oliver_twist$ and make your fortun out of #hand# added the dodger with a grin
and so be able to retire on your property and do the gen teel as i mean to in the very next leap #year# but four that ever comes and the forty second tuesday in trinity week said $charley_bates$
i dont like it rejoined $oliver_twist$ timidly i wish they would let me go i i would rather go and $mr_fagin$ would rather not rejoined $charley_bates$
$oliver_twist$ knew this too well but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly he only sighed and went on with his boot cleaning
go exclaimed the dodger why where your spirit dont you take any pride out of yourself would you go and be dependent on your #friend#
oh blow that said #master# $charley_bates$ drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his #pocket# and tossing them into a cupboard that too mean that is
you can leave your #friend# though said $oliver_twist$ with a half smile and let them be punished for what you did
that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipe that was all out of consideration for $mr_fagin$ cause the traps know that we work together and he might have got into trouble if we hadnt made our lucky that was the move wasnt it $charley_bates$
#master# $charley_bates$ nodded assent and would have spoken but the recollection of $oliver_twist$ flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his #head# and down into his throat and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping about five #minute# long
i couldnt do it said the dodger with an #air# of haughty disgust #look# here said the dodger drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence
here a jolly #life# what the odds where it comes from here catch hold there plenty more where they were took from
you wont wont you oh you precious flat it naughty aint it $oliver_twist$ inquired $charley_bates$ he ll come to be scragged wont he
as he said it #master# $charley_bates$ caught up an end of his neckerchief and holding it erect in the #air# dropped his #head# on his shoulder and jerked a curious sound through his teeth thereby indicating by a lively pantomimic representation that scragging and hanging were #one# and the same #thing#
i dont know what that means replied $oliver_twist$ #something# in this #way# old feller said charly that what it means said $charley_bates$
#look# how he stares jack i never did see such prime company as that ere #boy# he ll be the #death# of me
i know he will #master# $charley_bates$ having laughed heartily again resumed his pipe with #tear# in his #eye# you ve been brought up bad said the dodger surveying his boots with much satisfaction when $oliver_twist$ had polished them
you better begin at once for you ll come to the trade long before you think of it and you re only losing #time# $oliver_twist$
#master# $charley_bates$ backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own which being exhausted he and his #friend# $mr_john_dawkins$ launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the #life# they led interspersed with a variety of hints to $oliver_twist$ that the best #thing# he could do would be to secure $mr_fagin$ favour without more delay by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it
and always put this in your pipe nolly said the dodger as the jew was heard unlocking the #door# above if you dont take fogels and tickers
$mr_fagin$ will make #something# of you though or you ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable what the good of talking in that #way# interposed #master# $charley_bates$ he dont know what you mean
if you dont take #pocket# handkechers and watches said the dodger reducing his conversation to the level of $oliver_twist$ capacity some other cove will so that the coves that lose em will be all the worse and you ll be all the worse too and nobody half a ha orth the better except the chaps wot gets them and you ve just as good a right to them as they have
to be sure to be sure said the jew who had entered unseen by $oliver_twist$ it all lies in a nutshell my #dear# in a nutshell take the dodger #word# for it
the old #man# rubbed his #hand# gleefully together as he corroborated the dodger reasoning in these terms and chuckled with delight at his pupil proficiency
the conversation proceeded no farther at this #time# for the jew had returned home accompanied by miss betsy and a #gentleman# whom $oliver_twist$ had never seen before but who was accosted by the dodger as $tom_white$ $mr_chitling$ and who having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the #lady# now made his appearance
$mr_chitling$ was older in #year# than the dodger having perhaps numbered eighteen winters but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young #gentleman# which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements
he had small twinkling #eye# and a pock marked #face# wore a fur cap a dark corduroy jacket greasy fustian trousers and an apron
his wardrobe was in truth rather out of repair but he excused himself to the company by stating that his #time# was only out an #hour# before and that in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes
$mr_chitling$ added with strong marks of irritation that the new #way# of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional for it burnt holes in them and there was no remedy against the county
the same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair which he held to be decidedly unlawful
$mr_chitling$ wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of #anything# for forty two moral long hard working #day# and that he wished he might be busted if he warnt as dry as a lime basket
where do you think the #gentleman# has come from $oliver_twist$ inquired the jew with a grin as the other #boy# put a bottle of spirits on the #table#
ha ha ha he understands the catechism of his trade i i dont know #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ who that inquired $tom_white$ $mr_chitling$ casting a contemptuous #look# at $oliver_twist$
a young #friend# of mine my #dear# replied the jew he in luck then said the young #man# with a meaning #look# at $mr_fagin$
never #mind# where i came from young un you ll find your #way# there soon enough i ll bet a crown at this sally the #boy# laughed
after some #word# apart between the last comer and $mr_fagin$ they drew their #chair# towards the #fire# and the jew telling $oliver_twist$ to come and sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers
these were the great advantages of the trade the proficiency of the dodger the amiability of $charley_bates$ and the liberality of the jew himself
at #length# these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted and $mr_chitling$ did the same for the #house# of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two
after some more jokes on the same subject they exchanged a few short whispers with $mr_fagin$ and withdrew miss betsy accordingly withdrew and left the party to their repose
from this #day# $oliver_twist$ was seldom left alone but was placed in almost constant communication with the two #boy# who played the old game with the jew every #day# whether for their own improvement or $oliver_twist$ $mr_fagin$ best knew
at other #time# the old #man# would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger #day# mixed up with so much that was droll and curious that $oliver_twist$ could not help laughing heartily and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings
having prepared his #mind# by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad #thought# in such a dreary #place# he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever
in short the wily old jew had the #boy# in his toils #chapter# xix in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on
it was a chill damp windy #night# when the jew buttoning his great coat tight round his shrivelled body and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower #part# of his #face# emerged from his den
he paused on the step as the #door# was locked and chained behind him and having listened while the #boy# made all secure and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible slunk down the #street# as quickly as he could
the jew stopped for an instant at the #corner# of the #street# and glancing suspiciously round crossed the road and struck off in the direction of the spitalfields
the mud lay thick upon the stones and a black mist hung over the #street# the rain fell sluggishly down and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch
the #house# to which $oliver_twist$ had been conveyed was in the neighborhood of whitechapel it seemed just the #night# when it befitted such a being as the jew to be abroad
as he glided stealthily along creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways the hideous old #man# seemed like some loathsome reptile engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved crawling forth by #night# in search of some rich offal for a meal
he kept on his course through many winding and narrow #way# until he reached bethnal green then turning suddenly off to the left he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty #street# which abound in that close and densely populated quarter
the jew was evidently too familiar with the #ground# he traversed to be at all bewildered either by the darkness of the #night# or the intricacies of the #way#
he hurried through several alleys and #street# and at #length# turned into #one# lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end
at the #door# of a #house# in this #street# he knocked having exchanged a few muttered #word# with the #person# who opened it he walked upstairs
a #dog# growled as he touched the handle of a #room# #door# and a #man# #voice# demanded who was there only me $bill_sikes$ only me my #dear# said the jew looking in
bring in your body then said $mr_william_sikes$ lie down you stupid brute dont you know the devil when he got a great coat on
apparently the #dog# had been somewhat deceived by $mr_fagin$ outer garment for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a #chair# he retired to the #corner# from which he had risen wagging his tail as he went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be
the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception for $mr_fagin$ and his young #friend# had not met since she had interfered in behalf of $oliver_twist$
well said $mr_william_sikes$ well my #dear# replied the jew ah $miss_nancy$ all doubts upon the subject if he had any were speedily removed by the young #lady# behaviour
she took her #foot# off the fender pushed back her #chair# and bade $mr_fagin$ draw up his without saying more about it for it was a cold #night# and no mistake
it is cold $miss_nancy$ #dear# said the jew as he warmed his skinny #hand# over the #fire# it seems to go right through #one# added the old #man# touching his #side#
it must be a piercer if it finds its #way# through your #heart# said $mr_william_sikes$ give him #something# to drink $miss_nancy$
it enough to turn a #man# ill to see his lean old carcase shivering in that #way# like a ugly ghost just $miss_rose$ from the grave
$miss_nancy$ quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which there were many which to judge from the diversity of their appearance were filled with several kinds of liquids
burn my body make haste $mr_william_sikes$ pouring out a glass of brandy bade the jew drink it off quite enough quite thankye $bill_sikes$ replied the jew putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it
what you re afraid of our getting the better of you are you inquired $mr_william_sikes$ fixing his #eye# on the jew
with a hoarse grunt of contempt $mr_william_sikes$ seized the glass and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself which he did at once
the jew glanced round the #room# as his #companion# tossed down the second glassful not in curiousity for he had seen it often before but in a restless and suspicious #manner# habitual to him
it was a meanly furnished apartment with #nothing# but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was #anything# but a working #man# and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a #corner# and a #life# preserver that hung over the chimney piece
ugh there said $mr_william_sikes$ smacking his lips now i ready for business inquired the jew for business replied $mr_william_sikes$
so say what you ve got to say about the crib at chertsey $bill_sikes$ said the jew drawing his #chair# forward and speaking in a very low #voice#
yes wot about it inquired $mr_william_sikes$ ah you know what i mean my #dear# said the jew he knows what i mean $miss_nancy$ dont he
speak out and call #thing# by their right #name# dont sit there winking and blinking and talking to me in hints as if you warnt the very first that #thought# about the robbery
wot ye mean hush $bill_sikes$ hush said the jew who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation somebody will hear us my #dear#
no he dont sneered $mr_william_sikes$ or he wont and that the same #thing# somebody will hear us
but as $mr_william_sikes$ did care on reflection he dropped his #voice# as he said the #word# and grew calmer
let em hear said $mr_william_sikes$ i dont care there there said the jew coaxingly it was only my caution #nothing# more
now my #dear# about that crib at chertsey when is it to be done $bill_sikes$ eh when is it to be done
such plate my #dear# such plate said the jew rubbing his #hand# and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation
not at all replied $mr_william_sikes$ coldly not to be done at all echoed the jew leaning back in his #chair#
no not at all rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ at least it cant be a put up job as we expected then it hasnt been properly gone about said the jew turning pale with anger
i tell you that $mr_toby_crackit$ has been hanging about the #place# for a fortnight and he cant get #one# of the servants in line
dont tell me but i will tell you retorted $mr_william_sikes$ who are you that not to be told do you mean to tell me $bill_sikes$ said the jew softening as the other grew
heated that neither of the two #man# in the #house# can be got over yes i do mean to tell you so replied $mr_william_sikes$
the old #lady# has had em these twenty #year# and if you were to give em five hundred pound they wouldnt be in it
but do you mean to say my #dear# remonstrated the jew that the #woman# cant be got over not a bit of it replied $mr_william_sikes$
not by flash $mr_toby_crackit$ said the jew incredulously think what #woman# are $bill_sikes$ no not even by flash
he says he worn sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole blessed #time# he been loitering down there and it all of no use
$mr_toby_crackit$ replied $mr_william_sikes$ he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers my #dear# said the jew
so he did rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ and they warnt of no more use than the other plant the jew looked blank at this information
after ruminating for some #minute# with his chin sunk on his breast he raised his #head# and said with a deep sigh that if flash $mr_toby_crackit$ reported aright he feared the game was up
and yet said the old #man# dropping his #hand# on his knees it a sad #thing# my #dear# to lose so much when we had set our #heart# upon it
a long #silence# ensued during which the jew was plunged in deep #thought# with his #face# wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal
$miss_nancy$ apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker sat with her #eye# fixed upon the #fire# as if she had been deaf to all that passed
$mr_fagin$ said $mr_william_sikes$ abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed is it worth fifty shiners extra if it safely done from the outside
so it is said $mr_william_sikes$ worse luck $mr_william_sikes$ eyed him furtively from #time# to #time# yes said the jew as suddenly rousing himself
yes my #dear# yes rejoined the jew his #eye# glistening and every muscle in his #face# working with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened
is it a bargain inquired $mr_william_sikes$ then said $mr_william_sikes$ thrusting aside the jew #hand# with some disdain let it come off as soon as you like
$mr_toby_crackit$ and me were over the garden wall the #night# afore last sounding the panels of the #door# and shutters the crib barred up at #night# like a jail but there #one# #part# we can crack safe and softly
which is that $bill_sikes$ asked the jew eagerly why whispered $mr_william_sikes$ as you cross the lawn yes said the jew bending his #head# forward with his #eye# almost starting out of it
umph cried $mr_william_sikes$ stopping short as the #girl# scarcely moving her #head# looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jew #face#
you cant do it without me i know but it best to be on the safe #side# when #one# deals with you
never #mind# which #part# it is as you like my #dear# as you like replied the jew is there no help wanted but yours and $mr_toby_crackit$
none said $mr_william_sikes$ cept a centre bit and a #boy# the first we ve both got the second you must find us
a #boy# exclaimed the jew oh then it a panel eh never #mind# wot it is replied $mr_william_sikes$
i want a #boy# and he musnt be a big un lord said $mr_william_sikes$ reflectively if i only got that young #boy# of ned the chimbley sweeper
but the father gets lagged and then the juvenile delinquent society comes and takes the #boy# away from a trade where he was earning money teaches him to read and write and in #time# makes a prentice of him
and so they go on said $mr_william_sikes$ his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs so they go on and if they got money enough which it a providence they havent we shouldnt have half a dozen #boy# left in the whole trade in a #year# or two
no more we should acquiesced the jew who had been considering during this speech and had only caught the last sentence
the jew nodded his #head# towards $miss_nancy$ who was still gazing at the #fire# and intimated by a sign that he would have her told to leave the #room#
$mr_william_sikes$ shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he #thought# the precaution unnecessary but complied nevertheless by requesting $miss_nancy$ to fetch him a jug of beer
he kept him small on purpose and let him out by the job $bill_sikes$ what now inquired $mr_william_sikes$ you dont want any beer said $miss_nancy$ folding her #arm# and retaining her seat very composedly
i tell you i do replied $mr_william_sikes$ nonsense rejoined the #girl# coolly go on $mr_fagin$ i know what he going to say $bill_sikes$ he neednt #mind# me
the jew still hesitated $mr_william_sikes$ looked from #one# to the other in some surprise why you dont #mind# the old #girl# do you $mr_fagin$
he asked at #length# you ve known her long enough to trust her or the devil in it she aint #one# to blab
are you $miss_nancy$ i should think not replied the young #lady# drawing her #chair# up to the #table# and putting her elbows upon it
no no my #dear# i know you re not said the jew but and again the old #man# paused but wot inquired $mr_william_sikes$
i didnt know whether she mightnt r aps be out of sorts you know my #dear# as she was the other #night# replied the jew
at this confession $miss_nancy$ burst into a loud laugh and swallowing a glass of brandy shook her #head# with an #air# of defiance and burst into sundry exclamations of keep the game a going
these seemed to have the effect of re assuring both #gentleman# for the jew nodded his #head# with a satisfied #air# and resumed his seat as did $mr_william_sikes$ likewise
never say die and the like now $mr_fagin$ said $miss_nancy$ with a laugh tell $bill_sikes$ at once about $oliver_twist$
you re a clever #one# my #dear# the sharpest #girl# i ever saw said the jew patting her on the neck
ha it was about $oliver_twist$ i was going to speak sure enough ha ha ha what about him demanded $mr_william_sikes$
he the #boy# for you my #dear# replied the jew in a hoarse whisper laying his finger on the #side# of his nose and grinning frightfully
he maynt be so much up as any of the others but that not what you want if he only to open a #door# for you
he exclaimed $mr_william_sikes$ have him $bill_sikes$ said $miss_nancy$ i would if i was in your #place# depend upon it
he a safe #one# $bill_sikes$ i know he is rejoined $mr_fagin$ he been in good training these last few weeks and it #time# he began to work for his bread
besides the others are all too big well he is just the size i want said $mr_william_sikes$ ruminating
and will do everything you want $bill_sikes$ my #dear# interposed the jew he cant help himself that is if you frighten him enough
if there #anything# queer about him when we once get into the work in for a penny in for a pound
frighten him echoed $mr_william_sikes$ it ll be no sham frightening #mind# you you wont see him alive again $mr_fagin$ think of that before you send him
mark my #word# said the robber poising a crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead i ve #thought# of it all said the jew with energy
once let him feel that he is #one# of us once fill his #mind# with the idea that he has been a thief and he ours
i ve i ve had my #eye# upon him my #dear# close close ours for his #life# oho it couldnt have come about better
the old #man# crossed his #arm# upon his breast and drawing his #head# and shoulders into a heap literally hugged himself for joy
ours said $mr_william_sikes$ yours you mean perhaps i do my #dear# said the jew with a shrill chuckle
and wot said $mr_william_sikes$ scowling fiercely on his agreeable #friend# wot makes you take so much pains about #one# chalk faced kid when you know there are fifty #boy# snoozing about common garden every #night# as you might pick and choose from
mine if you like $bill_sikes$ because they re of no use to me my #dear# replied the jew with some confusion not worth the taking
their #look# convict em when they get into trouble and i lose em all with this #boy# properly managed my #dear# i could do what i couldnt with twenty of them
besides said the jew recovering his self possession he has us now if he could only give us leg bail again and he must be in the same boat with us
never #mind# how he came there it quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery that all i want
now how much better this is than being obliged to put the poor leetle #boy# out of the #way# which would be dangerous and we should lose by it besides
when is it to be done asked $miss_nancy$ stopping some turbulent exclamation on the #part# of $mr_william_sikes$ expressive of the disgust with which he received $mr_fagin$ affectation of humanity
i planned with $mr_toby_crackit$ the #night# arter to morrow rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ in a surly #voice# if he heerd #nothing# from me to the contrairy
ah to be sure said the jew when is it to be done $bill_sikes$ good said the jew there no moon
no rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ it all arranged about bringing off the swag is it asked the jew $mr_william_sikes$ nodded
and about oh ah it all planned rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ interrupting him never #mind# particulars you better bring the #boy# here to morrow #night#
i shall get off the stone an #hour# arter daybreak then you hold your tongue and keep the melting pot ready and that all you ll have to do
after some discussion in which all three took an active #part# it was decided that $miss_nancy$ should repair to the jew next evening when the #night# had set in and bring $oliver_twist$ away with her $mr_fagin$ craftily observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would be more willing to accompany the #girl# who had so recently interfered in his behalf than anybody else
it was also solemnly arranged that poor $oliver_twist$ should for the purposes of the contemplated expedition be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of $mr_william_sikes$ and further that the said $mr_william_sikes$ should deal with him as he #thought# fit and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him it being understood that to render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by $mr_william_sikes$ on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash $mr_toby_crackit$
these preliminaries adjusted $mr_william_sikes$ proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming #manner# yelling forth at the same #time# most unmusical snatches of song mingled with wild execrations
at #length# in a fit of professional enthusiasm he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools which he had no sooner stumbled in with and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained and the peculiar beauties of their construction than he fell over the box upon the floor and went to sleep where he fell
good #night# $miss_nancy$ said the jew muffling himself up as before good #night# their #eye# met and the jew scrutinised her narrowly
there was no flinching about the #girl# she was as true and earnest in the #matter# as $mr_toby_crackit$ himself could be
the jew again bade her good #night# and bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of $mr_william_sikes$ while her back was turned groped downstairs
the worst of these #woman# is that a very little #thing# serves to call up some long forgotten feeling and the best of them is that it never lasts
always the #way# muttered the jew to himself as he turned homeward ha ha the #man# against the #child# for a bag of gold
beguiling the #time# with these pleasant reflections $mr_fagin$ wended his #way# through mud and mire to his gloomy abode where the dodger was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return
is $oliver_twist$ a #bed# i want to speak to him was his first remark as they descended the stairs #hour# ago replied the dodger throwing open a #door#
the #boy# was lying fast asleep on a rude #bed# upon the floor so pale with anxiety and sadness and the closeness of his prison that he looked like #death# not #death# as it shows in shroud and coffin but in the guise it wears when #life# has just departed when a young and gentle spirit has but an instant fled to heaven and the gross #air# of the world has not had #time# to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed
here he is not now said the jew turning softly away to morrow to morrow #chapter# xx wherein $oliver_twist$ is delivered over to mr
when $oliver_twist$ awoke in the #morning# he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at his bedside and that his old shoes had been removed
at first he was pleased with the discovery hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release but such #thought# were quickly dispelled on his sitting down to breakfast along with the jew who told him in a tone and #manner# which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the residence of $bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ that #night#
$mr_william_sikes$ to to stop there #sir# asked $oliver_twist$ anxiously no no my #dear# not to stop there replied the jew
we shouldnt like to lose you dont be afraid $oliver_twist$ you shall come back to us again ha ha ha we wont be so cruel as to send you away my #dear#
the old #man# who was stooping over the #fire# toasting a piece of bread looked round as he bantered $oliver_twist$ thus and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could
i suppose said the jew fixing his #eye# on $oliver_twist$ you want to know what you re going to $bill_sikes$ for eh my #dear#
$oliver_twist$ coloured involuntarily to find that the old thief had been reading his #thought# but boldly said yes he did want to know
oh no no why do you think inquired $mr_fagin$ parrying the question indeed i dont know #sir# replied $oliver_twist$
bah said the jew turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the #boy# #face# wait till $bill_sikes$ tells you then
the jew seemed much vexed by $oliver_twist$ not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject but the truth is that although $oliver_twist$ felt very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of $mr_fagin$ #look# and his own speculations to make any further inquiries just then
he had no other opportunity for the jew remained very surly and silent till #night# when he prepared to go abroad
you may burn a candle said the jew putting #one# upon the #table# and here a #book# for you to read till they come to fetch you
good #night# good #night# replied $oliver_twist$ softly the jew walked to the #door# looking over his shoulder at the #boy# as he went
suddenly stopping he called him by his #name# $oliver_twist$ looked up the jew pointing to the candle motioned him to #light# it
he did so and as he placed the candlestick upon the #table# saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him with lowering and contracted brows from the dark end of the #room#
take heed $oliver_twist$ take heed said the old #man# shaking his right #hand# before him in a warning #manner# he a rough #man# and thinks #nothing# of blood when his own is up
placing a strong emphasis on the last #word# he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin and nodding his #head# left the #room#
$oliver_twist$ leaned his #head# upon his #hand# when the old #man# disappeared and pondered with a trembling #heart# on the #word# he had just heard
the more he #thought# of the jew admonition the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning
he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to $mr_william_sikes$ which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with $mr_fagin$ and after meditating for a long #time# concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker until another #boy# better suited for his purpose could be engaged
he was too well accustomed to suffering and had suffered too much where he was to bewail the prospect of change very severely
he remained lost in #thought# for some #minute# and then with a heavy sigh snuffed the candle and taking up the #book# which the jew had left with him began to read
whatever falls out say #nothing# and do what he bids you #mind# he turned over the leaves carelessly at first but lighting on a passage which attracted his attention he soon became intent upon the volume
it was a history of the #life# and trials of great criminals and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use
here he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside of bodies hidden from the #eye# of #man# in deep pits and wells which would not keep them down deep as they were but had yielded them up at last after many #year# and so maddened the murderers with the sight that in their horror they had confessed their guilt and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony
here too he read of #man# who lying in their #bed# at dead of #night# had been tempted so they said and led on by their own bad #thought# to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the limbs quail to think of
the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore and the #word# upon them to be sounded in his ears as if they were whispered in hollow murmurs by the spirits of the dead
then falling upon his knees he prayed heaven to spare him from such deeds and rather to will that he should die at once than be reserved for crimes so fearful and appalling
by degrees he grew more calm and besought in a low and broken #voice# that he might be rescued from his present dangers and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast #boy# who had never known the love of #friend# or kindred it might come to him now when desolate and deserted he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt
he had concluded his prayer but still remained with his #head# buried in his #hand# when a rustling noise aroused him
in a paroxysm of fear the #boy# closed the #book# and thrust it from him what that he cried starting up and catching sight of a figure standing by the #door#
who there me only me replied a tremulous #voice# $oliver_twist$ raised the candle above his #head# and looked towards the #door#
it was $miss_nancy$ put down the #light# said the #girl# turning away her #head# it hurts my #eye# $oliver_twist$ saw that she was very pale and gently inquired if she were ill
the #girl# threw herself into a #chair# with her back towards him and wrung her #hand# but made no reply
god forgive me she cried after a while i never #thought# of this has #anything# happened asked $oliver_twist$ can i help you
i will if i can i will indeed she rocked herself to and fro caught her throat and uttering a gurgling sound gasped for breath
the #girl# beat her #hand# upon her knees and her #foot# upon the #ground# and suddenly stopping drew her shawl close round her and shivered with cold
drawing her #chair# close to it she sat there for a little #time# without speaking but at #length# she raised her #head# and looked round
i dont know what comes over me sometimes said she affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress it this damp dirty #room# i think
$miss_nancy$ cried $oliver_twist$ what is it $oliver_twist$ stirred the #fire# now nolly #dear# are you ready am i to go with you asked $oliver_twist$
yes i have come from $bill_sikes$ replied the #girl# you are to go with me what for asked $oliver_twist$ recoiling
what for echoed the #girl# raising her #eye# and averting them again the #moment# they encountered the #boy# #face#
oh for no harm i dont believe it said $oliver_twist$ who had watched her closely have it your own #way# rejoined the #girl# affecting to laugh
$oliver_twist$ could see that he had some power over the #girl# better feelings and for an instant #thought# of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state
but then the #thought# darted across his #mind# that it was barely eleven clock and that many #people# were still in the #street# of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale
for no good then as the reflection occured to him he stepped forward and said somewhat hastily that he was ready
she eyed him narrowly while he spoke and cast upon him a #look# of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his #thought#
neither his brief consideration nor its purport was lost on his #companion# hush said the #girl# stooping over him and pointing to the #door# as she looked cautiously round
you cant help yourself i have tried hard for you but all to no purpose you are hedged round and round
if ever you are to get loose from here this is not the #time# struck by the energy of her #manner# $oliver_twist$ looked up in her #face# with great surprise
i have saved you from being ill used once and i will again and i do now continued the #girl# aloud for those who would have fetched you if i had not would have been far more rough than me
i have promised for your being quiet and silent if you are not you will only do harm to yourself and me too and perhaps be my #death#
she seemed to speak the truth her countenance was white and agitated and she trembled with very earnestness see here
i have borne all this for you already as true as god sees me show it she pointed hastily to some livid bruises on her neck and #arm# and continued with great rapidity remember this
and dont let me suffer more for you just now if i could help you i would but i have not the power
they dont mean to harm you whatever they make you do is no fault of yours hush every #word# from you is a blow for me
she caught the #hand# which $oliver_twist$ instinctively placed in hers and blowing out the #light# drew him after her up the stairs
the #door# was opened quickly by some #one# shrouded in the darkness and was as quickly closed when they had passed out
a hackney cabriolet was in waiting with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing $oliver_twist$ the #girl# pulled him in with her and drew the curtains close
give me your #hand# make haste your #hand# the driver wanted no directions but lashed his horse into full speed without the delay of an instant
the #girl# still held $oliver_twist$ fast by the #hand# and continued to pour into his ear the warnings and assurances she had already imparted
all was so quick and hurried that he had scarcely #time# to recollect where he was or how he came there when the carriage stopped at the #house# to which the jew steps had been directed on the previous evening
for #one# brief #moment# $oliver_twist$ cast a hurried glance along the empty #street# and a cry for help hung upon his lips
but the #girl# #voice# was in his ear beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her that he had not the #heart# to utter it
while he hesitated the opportunity was gone he was already in the #house# and the #door# was shut this #way# said the #girl# releasing her hold for the first #time#
$bill_sikes$ hallo replied $mr_william_sikes$ appearing at the #head# of the stairs with a candle oh that the #time# of #day#
come on this was a very strong expression of approbation an uncommonly hearty welcome from a #person# of $mr_william_sikes$ temperament
$miss_nancy$ appearing much gratified thereby saluted him cordially bull #eye# gone home with $tom_white$ observed $mr_william_sikes$ as he lighted them up
so you ve got the kid said $mr_william_sikes$ when they had all reached the #room# closing the #door# as he spoke
he have been in the #way# that right rejoined $miss_nancy$ yes here he is replied $miss_nancy$ did he come quiet inquired $mr_william_sikes$
i glad to hear it said $mr_william_sikes$ looking grimly at $oliver_twist$ for the sake of his young carcase as would otherways have suffered for it
like a lamb rejoined $miss_nancy$ come here young un and let me read you a lectur which is as well got over at once
thus addressing his new pupil $mr_william_sikes$ pulled off $oliver_twist$ cap and threw it into a #corner# and then taking him by the shoulder sat himself down by the #table# and stood the #boy# in front of him
now first do you know wot this is inquired $mr_william_sikes$ taking up a #pocket# pistol which lay on the #table# $oliver_twist$ replied in the affirmative
well then #look# here continued $mr_william_sikes$ this is powder that ere a bullet and this is a little bit of a old #hat# for waddin
$oliver_twist$ murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to and $mr_william_sikes$ proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and deliberation
well said the robber grasping $oliver_twist$ wrist and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched at which #moment# the #boy# could not repress a start if you speak a #word# when you re out #door# with me except when i speak to you that loading will be in your #head# without notice
now it loaded said $mr_william_sikes$ when he had finished yes i see it is #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ so if you do make up your #mind# to speak without leave say your prayers first
having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning to increase its effect $mr_william_sikes$ continued as near as i know there isnt anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you
if you was disposed of so i neednt take this devil and all of trouble to explain #matter# to you if it warnt for your own good
the short and the long of what you mean said $miss_nancy$ speaking very emphatically and slightly frowning at $oliver_twist$ as if to bespeak his serious attention to her #word# is that if you re crossed by him in this job you have on #hand# you ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards by shooting him through the #head# and will take your chance of swinging for it as you do for a great many other #thing# in the #way# of business every month of your #life#
d ye hear me that it observed $mr_william_sikes$ approvingly #woman# can always put #thing# in fewest #word# except when it blowing up and then they lengthens it out
in pursuance of this request $miss_nancy$ quickly laid the cloth disappearing for a few #minute# she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep #head# which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the #part# of $mr_william_sikes$ founded upon the singular coincidence of jemmies being a can #name# common to them and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession
indeed the worthy #gentleman# stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service was in great spirits and good humour in proof whereof it may be here remarked that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught and did not utter on a rough calculation more than four score oaths during the whole progress of the meal
and now that he thoroughly up to it let have some supper and get a snooze before starting supper being ended it may be easily conceived that $oliver_twist$ had no great appetite for it mr
$mr_william_sikes$ disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and #water# and threw himself on the #bed# ordering $miss_nancy$ with many imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely
$oliver_twist$ stretched himself in his clothes by command of the same authority on a mattress upon the floor and the #girl# mending the #fire# sat before it in readiness to rouse them at the appointed #time#
for a long #time# $oliver_twist$ lay awake thinking it not impossible that $miss_nancy$ might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice but the #girl# sat brooding over the #fire# without moving save now and then to trim the #light#
when he awoke the #table# was covered with tea #thing# and $mr_william_sikes$ was thrusting various articles into the #pocket# of his great coat which hung over the back of a #chair#
weary with watching and anxiety he at #length# fell asleep $miss_nancy$ was busily engaged in preparing breakfast it was not yet daylight for the candle was still burning and it was quite dark outside
a sharp rain too was beating against the #window# panes and the sky looked black and cloudy now then growled $mr_william_sikes$ as $oliver_twist$ started up half past five
$oliver_twist$ was not long in making his toilet having taken some breakfast he replied to a surly inquiry from $mr_william_sikes$ by saying that he was quite ready
$miss_nancy$ scarcely looking at the #boy# threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat $mr_william_sikes$ gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders
thus attired he gave his #hand# to the robber who merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a #side# #pocket# of his great coat clasped it firmly in his and exchanging a farewell with $miss_nancy$ led him away
#look# sharp or you ll get no breakfast for it late as it is $oliver_twist$ turned for an instant when they reached the #door# in the hope of meeting a #look# from the #girl#
but she had resumed her old seat in front of the #fire# and sat perfectly motionless before it #chapter# xxi the expedition
it was a cheerless #morning# when they got into the #street# blowing and raining hard and the clouds looking dull and stormy
there was a faint glimmering of the coming #day# in the sky but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene the sombre #light# only serving to pale that which the #street# lamps afforded without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet #house# tops and dreary #street#
there appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town the #window# of the #house# were all closely shut and the #street# through which they passed were noiseless and empty
the #night# had been very wet large pools of #water# had collected in the road and the kennels were overflowing by the #time# they had turned into the bethnal green road the #day# had fairly begun to break
many of the lamps were already extinguished a few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards london now and then a stage coach covered with mud rattled briskly by the driver bestowing as he passed an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who by keeping on the wrong #side# of the road had endangered his arriving at the office a quarter of a #minute# after his #time#
the public #house# with gas #light# burning inside were already open by degrees other shops began to be unclosed and a few scattered #people# were met with
then came straggling groups of labourers going to their work then #man# and #woman# with fish baskets on their #head# donkey carts laden with vegetables chaise carts filled with live stock or whole carcasses of meat milk #woman# with pails an unbroken concourse of #people# trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town
as they approached the city the noise and traffic gradually increased when they threaded the #street# between shoreditch and smithfield it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle
it was as #light# as it was likely to be till #night# came on again and the busy #morning# of half the london population had begun
turning down sun #street# and crown #street# and crossing finsbury square $mr_william_sikes$ struck by #way# of chiswell #street# into barbican thence into long lane and so into smithfield from which latter #place# arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled $oliver_twist$ with amazement
the #ground# was covered nearly ankle deep with filth and mire a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest upon the chimney tops hung heavily above
all the pens in the centre of the large area and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space were filled with sheep tied up to posts by the gutter #side# were long lines of beasts and oxen three or four deep
countrymen butchers drovers hawkers #boy# thieves idlers and vagabonds of every low grade were mingled together in a mass the whistling of drovers the barking #dog# the bellowing and plunging of the oxen the bleating of sheep the grunting and squeaking of pigs the cries of hawkers the shouts oaths and quarrelling on all #side# the ringing of bells and roar of #voice# that issued from every public #house# the crowding pushing driving beating whooping and yelling the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every #corner# of the market and the unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty figures constantly running to and fro and bursting in and out of the throng rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene which quite confounded the senses
$mr_william_sikes$ dragging $oliver_twist$ after him elbowed his #way# through the thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the #boy#
he nodded twice or thrice to a passing #friend# and resisting as many invitations to take a #morning# dram pressed steadily onward until they were clear of the turmoil and had made their #way# through hosier lane into holborn
it was market #morning# now young un said $mr_william_sikes$ looking up at the clock of st andrew church hard upon seven you must step out
$mr_william_sikes$ accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little #companion# wrist $oliver_twist$ quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the #house# breaker as well as he could
they held their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park #corner# and were on their #way# to kensington when $mr_william_sikes$ relaxed his pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind came up
seeing hounslow written on it he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume if he would give them a lift as far as isleworth
yes he my #boy# replied $mr_william_sikes$ looking hard at $oliver_twist$ and putting his #hand# abstractedly into the #pocket# where the pistol was
your father walks rather too quick for you dont he my #man# inquired the driver seeing that $oliver_twist$ was out of breath
come dont lag behind already lazy legs jump up said the #man# is that your #boy# not a bit of it replied $mr_william_sikes$ interposing
thus addressing $oliver_twist$ he helped him into the cart and the driver pointing to a heap of sacks told him to lie down there and rest himself
he used to it here take hold of my #hand# ned in with you as they passed the different mile stones $oliver_twist$ wondered more and more where his #companion# meant to take him
kensington hammersmith chiswick kew bridge brentford were all passed and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey
at #length# they came to a public #house# called the coach and horses a little #way# beyond which another road appeared to run off
$mr_william_sikes$ dismounted with great precipitation holding $oliver_twist$ by the #hand# all the while and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious #look# upon him and rapped the #side# #pocket# with his fist in a significant #manner#
and here the cart stopped good bye #boy# said the #man# he sulky replied $mr_william_sikes$ giving him a shake he sulky
a young #dog# dont #mind# him not i rejoined the other getting into his cart it a fine #day# after all
$mr_william_sikes$ waited until he had fairly gone and then telling $oliver_twist$ he might #look# about him if he wanted once again led him onward on his journey
they turned round to the left a short #way# past the public #house# and then taking a right #hand# road walked on for a long #time# passing many large gardens and #gentleman# #house# on both #side# of the #way# and stopping for #nothing# but a little beer until they reached a town
and he drove away here against the wall of a #house# $oliver_twist$ saw written up in pretty large letters hampton they lingered about in the fields for some #hour#
at #length# they came back into the town and turning into an old public #house# with a defaced sign board ordered some dinner by the kitchen #fire#
the kitchen was an old low roofed #room# with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling and benches with high backs to them by the #fire# on which were seated several rough #man# in smock frocks drinking and smoking
they took no notice of $oliver_twist$ and very little of $mr_william_sikes$ and as $mr_william_sikes$ took very little notice of them he and his young comrade sat in a #corner# by themselves without being much troubled by their company
they had some cold meat for dinner and sat so long after it while $mr_william_sikes$ indulged himself with three or four pipes that $oliver_twist$ began to feel quite certain they were not going any further
being much tired with the walk and getting up so early he dozed a little at first then quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco fell asleep
rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and #look# about him he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring #man# over a pint of ale
it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from $mr_william_sikes$ so you re going on to lower halliford are you inquired $mr_william_sikes$
yes i am replied the #man# who seemed a little the worse or better as the case might be for drinking and not slow about it neither
my horse hasnt got a load behind him going back as he had coming up in the mornin and he wont be long a doing of it
could you give my #boy# and me a lift as far as there demanded $mr_william_sikes$ pushing the ale towards his new #friend#
here luck to him ecod he a good un if you re going directly i can replied the #man# looking out of the pot
are you going to halliford going on to shepperton replied $mr_william_sikes$ i your #man# as far as i go replied the other
is all paid becky yes the other #gentleman# paid replied the #girl# i say said the #man# with tipsy gravity that wont do you know
why not rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ you re a going to accommodate us and wot to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so in return
the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound #face# having done so he seized $mr_william_sikes$ by the #hand# and declared he was a real good fellow
to which $mr_william_sikes$ replied he was joking as if he had been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was
after the exchange of a few more compliments they bade the company good #night# and went out the #girl# gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so and lounging out to the #door# with her #hand# full to see the party start
$oliver_twist$ and $mr_william_sikes$ got in without any further ceremony and the #man# to whom he belonged having lingered for a #minute# or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal mounted also
then the hostler was told to give the horse his #head# and his #head# being given him he made a very unpleasant use of it tossing it into the #air# with great disdain and running into the parlour #window# over the #way# after performing those feats and supporting himself for a short #time# on his hind legs he started off at great speed and rattled out of the town right gallantly
the horse whose health had been drunk in his absence was standing outside ready harnessed to the cart the #night# was very dark
a damp mist $miss_rose$ from the river and the marshy #ground# about and spread itself over the dreary fields it was piercing cold too all was gloomy and black
not a #word# was spoken for the driver had grown sleepy and $mr_william_sikes$ was in no mood to lead him into conversation
$oliver_twist$ sat huddled together in a #corner# of the cart bewildered with alarm and apprehension and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees whose branches waved grimly to and fro as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene
there was a #light# in the ferry #house# #window# opposite which streamed across the road and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew tree with graves beneath it
there was a dull sound of falling #water# not far off and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the #night# wind
as they passed sunbury church the clock struck seven it seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead sunbury was passed through and they came again into the lonely road
two or three miles more and the cart stopped $mr_william_sikes$ alighted took $oliver_twist$ by the #hand# and they once again walked on
they turned into no #house# at shepperton as the weary #boy# had expected but still kept walking on in mud and darkness through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes until they came within sight of the #light# of a town at no great distance
on looking intently forward $oliver_twist$ saw that the #water# was just below them and that they were coming to the #foot# of a bridge
$mr_william_sikes$ kept straight on until they were close upon the bridge then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left
he was about to throw himself on the #ground# and make #one# struggle for his young #life# when he saw that they stood before a solitary #house# all ruinous and decayed
the #water# #thought# $oliver_twist$ turning sick with fear he has brought me to this lonely #place# to murder me there was a #window# on each #side# of the dilapidated entrance and #one# story above but no #light# was visible
the #house# was dark dismantled and the all appearance uninhabited $mr_william_sikes$ with $oliver_twist$ #hand# still in his softly approached the low porch and raised the latch
the #door# yielded to the pressure and they passed in together #chapter# xxii the burglary hallo cried a loud hoarse #voice# as soon as they set #foot# in the passage
dont make such a row said $mr_william_sikes$ bolting the #door# show a glim $mr_toby_crackit$ aha my pal cried the same #voice#
the speaker appeared to throw a boot jack or some such article at the #person# he addressed to rouse him from his slumbers for the noise of a wooden body falling violently was heard and then an indistinct muttering as of a #man# between sleep and awake
a glim $barney$ a glim show the #gentleman# in $barney$ wake up first if convenient do you hear cried the same #voice#
there $bill_sikes$ $mr_william_sikes$ in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him and you sleeping there as if you took laudanum with your meals and #nothing# stronger
a pair of slipshod #foot# shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the #room# as this interrogatory was put and there issued from a #door# on the right #hand# first a feeble candle and next the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose and officiating as waiter at the public #house# on saffron hill
are you any fresher now or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly bister $mr_william_sikes$ exclaimed $barney$ with real or counterfeit joy cub
id #sir# cub id here you get on first said $mr_william_sikes$ putting $oliver_twist$ in front of him quicker or i shall tread upon your heels
muttering a curse upon his tardiness $mr_william_sikes$ pushed $oliver_twist$ before him and they entered a low dark #room# with a smoky #fire# two or three broken #chair# a #table# and a very old couch on which with his legs much higher than his #head# a #man# was reposing at full #length# smoking a long clay pipe
he was dressed in a smartly cut snuff coloured coat with large brass buttons an orange neckerchief a coarse staring shawl pattern waistcoat and drab breeches
$mr_toby_crackit$ for he it was had no very great quantity of hair either upon his #head# or #face# but what he had was of a reddish dye and tortured into long corkscrew curls through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers ornamented with large common rings
he was a trifle above the middle size and apparently rather weak in the legs but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top boots which he contemplated in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction
$bill_sikes$ my #boy# said this figure turning his #head# towards the #door# i glad to see you i was almost afraid you given it up in which case i should have made a personal wentur
uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise as his #eye# rested on $oliver_twist$ $mr_toby_crackit$ brought himself into a sitting posture and demanded who that was
hallo the #boy# only the #boy# replied $mr_william_sikes$ drawing a #chair# towards the #fire# wud of bister fagid lads exclaimed $barney$ with a grin
$mr_fagin$ eh exclaimed $mr_toby_crackit$ looking at $oliver_twist$ wot an inwalable #boy# that ll make for the old #lady# #pocket# in chapels
there there enough of that interposed $mr_william_sikes$ impatiently and stooping over his recumbant #friend# he whispered a few #word# in his ear at which $mr_toby_crackit$ laughed immensely and honoured $oliver_twist$ with a long stare of astonishment
now said $mr_william_sikes$ as he resumed his seat if you ll give us #something# to eat and drink while we re waiting you ll put some #heart# in us or in me at all events
sit down by the #fire# younker and rest yourself for you ll have to go out with us again to #night# though not very far off
$oliver_twist$ looked at $mr_william_sikes$ in mute and timid wonder and drawing a stool to the #fire# sat with his aching #head# upon his #hand# scarecely knowing where he was or what was passing around him
here said $mr_toby_crackit$ as the young jew placed some fragments of food and a bottle upon the #table# success to the crack
he $miss_rose$ to honour the toast and carefully depositing his empty pipe in a #corner# advanced to the #table# filled a glass with spirits and drank off its contents
his mug is a fortin to him $mr_william_sikes$ did the same a drain for the #boy# said $mr_toby_crackit$ half filling a wine glass
down with it innocence indeed said $oliver_twist$ looking piteously up into the #man# #face# indeed i down with it echoed $mr_toby_crackit$
do you think i dont know what good for you tell him to drink it $bill_sikes$ he had better said $mr_william_sikes$ clapping his #hand# upon his #pocket#
burn my body if he isnt more trouble than a whole family of dodgers drink it you perwerse imp drink it
frightened by the menacing gestures of the two #man# $oliver_twist$ hastily swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing which delighted $mr_toby_crackit$ and $barney$ and even drew a smile from the surly $mr_william_sikes$
this done and $mr_william_sikes$ having satisfied his appetite $oliver_twist$ could eat #nothing# but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the two #man# laid themselves down on #chair# for a short nap
$oliver_twist$ retained his stool by the #fire# $barney$ wrapped in a blanket stretched himself on the floor close outside the fender
they slept or appeared to sleep for some #time# nobody stirring but $barney$ who $miss_rose$ once or twice to throw coals on the #fire#
$oliver_twist$ fell into a heavy doze imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes or wandering about the dark churchyard or retracing some #one# or other of the scenes of the past #day# when he was roused by $mr_toby_crackit$ jumping up and declaring it was half past #one#
$mr_william_sikes$ and his #companion# enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their great coats $barney$ opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he hastily crammed into the #pocket#
in an instant the other two were on their legs and all were actively engaged in busy preparation barkers for me $barney$ said $mr_toby_crackit$
here they are replied $barney$ producing a pair of pistols you loaded them yourself all right replied $mr_toby_crackit$ stowing them away
crape keys centre bits darkies #nothing# forgotten inquired $mr_toby_crackit$ fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat
the persuaders i ve got em replied $mr_william_sikes$ all right rejoined his #companion# bring them bits of timber $barney$ that the #time# of #day#
with these #word# he took a thick stick from $barney$ #hand# who having delivered another to $mr_toby_crackit$ busied himself in fastening on $oliver_twist$ cape
$oliver_twist$ who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise and the #air# and the drink which had been forced upon him put his #hand# mechanically into that which $mr_william_sikes$ extended for the purpose
now then said $mr_william_sikes$ holding out his #hand# take his other #hand# $mr_toby_crackit$ said $mr_william_sikes$ #look# out $barney$ the #man# went to the #door# and returned to announce that all was quiet
the two robbers issued forth with $oliver_twist$ between them $barney$ having made all fast rolled himself up as before and was soon asleep again
the fog was much heavier than it had been in the early #part# of the #night# and the atmosphere was so damp that although no rain fell $oliver_twist$ hair and eyebrows within a few #minute# after leaving the #house# had become stiff with the half frozen moisture that was floating about
it was now intensely dark they crossed the bridge and kept on towards the #light# which he had seen before they were at no great distance off and as they walked pretty briskly they soon arrived at chertsey
$mr_toby_crackit$ acquiesced and they hurried through the main #street# of the little town which at that late #hour# was wholly deserted
a dim #light# shone at intervals from some #bed# #room# #window# and the hoarse barking of #dog# occasionally broke the #silence# of the #night#
slap through the town whispered $mr_william_sikes$ there ll be nobody in the #way# to #night# to see us but there was nobody abroad
they had cleared the town as the church bell struck two quickening their pace they turned up a road upon the left #hand#
after walking about a quarter of a mile they stopped before a detached #house# surrounded by a wall to the top of which $mr_toby_crackit$ scarcely pausing to take breath climbed in a twinkling
before $oliver_twist$ had #time# to #look# round $mr_william_sikes$ had caught him under the #arm# and in three or four seconds he and $mr_toby_crackit$ were lying on the grass on the other #side#
the #boy# next said $mr_toby_crackit$ hoist him up i ll catch hold of him $mr_william_sikes$ followed directly and they stole cautiously towards the #house#
and now for the first #time# $oliver_twist$ well nigh mad with grief and terror saw that housebreaking and robbery if not murder were the objects of the expedition
a mist came before his #eye# the cold sweat stood upon his ashy #face# his limbs failed him and he sank upon his knees
murmured $mr_william_sikes$ trembling with rage and drawing the pistol from his #pocket# get up or i ll strew your brains upon the grass
he clasped his #hand# together and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror get up oh for god sake let me go
cried $oliver_twist$ let me run away and die in the fields i will never come near london never never oh pray have mercy on me and do not make me steal
the #man# to whom this appeal was made swore a dreadful oath and had cocked the pistol when $mr_toby_crackit$ striking it from his grasp placed his #hand# upon the #boy# mouth and dragged him to the #house#
for the love of all the bright angels that rest in heaven have mercy upon me hush cried the #man# it wont answer here
say another #word# and i ll do your business myself with a crack on the #head# that makes no noise and is quite as certain and more genteel
here $bill_sikes$ wrench the shutter open he game enough now i ll engage i ve seen older #hand# of his age took the same #way# for a #minute# or two on a cold #night#
$mr_william_sikes$ invoking terrific imprecations upon $mr_fagin$ #head# for sending $oliver_twist$ on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little noise
it was a little lattice #window# about five #foot# and a half above the #ground# at the back of the #house# which belonged to a scullery or small brewing #place# at the end of the passage
the aperture was so small that the inmates had probably not #thought# it worth while to defend it more securely but it was large enough to admit a #boy# of $oliver_twist$ size nevertheless
a very brief exercise of mr sike art sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice and it soon stood wide open also
now listen you young limb whispered $mr_william_sikes$ drawing a dark lantern from his #pocket# and throwing the glare full on $oliver_twist$ #face# i a going to put you through there
take this #light# go softly up the steps straight afore you and along the little hall to the #street# #door# unfasten it and let us in
after some delay and some assistance from $mr_toby_crackit$ the shutter to which he had referred swung open on its hinges there a bolt at the top you wont be able to reach interposed $mr_toby_crackit$
there are three there $bill_sikes$ with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on em which is the old #lady# #arm#
stand upon #one# of the hall #chair# keep quiet cant you replied $mr_william_sikes$ with a threatening #look# the #room# #door# is open is it
the game of that is that they always leave it open with a catch so that the #dog# who got a #bed# in here may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful
although $mr_toby_crackit$ spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed without noise $mr_william_sikes$ imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get to work
$mr_toby_crackit$ complied by first producing his lantern and placing it on the #ground# then by planting himself firmly with his #head# against the wall beneath the #window# and his #hand# upon his knees so as to make a step of his back
this was no sooner done than $mr_william_sikes$ mounting upon him put $oliver_twist$ gently through the #window# with his #foot# first and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the floor inside
wide replied $mr_toby_crackit$ after peeping in to satisfy himself ha ha $barney$ ticed him away to #night# so neat take this lantern said $mr_william_sikes$ looking into the #room#
$mr_william_sikes$ pointing to the #street# #door# with the pistol barrel briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the #way# and that if he faltered he would fall dead that instant
you see the stairs afore you $oliver_twist$ more dead than alive gasped out yes it done in a #minute# said $mr_william_sikes$ in the same low whisper
directly i leave go of you do your work hark what that whispered the other #man# they listened intently
in the short #time# he had had to collect his senses the #boy# had firmly resolved that whether he died in the attempt or not he would make #one# effort to dart upstairs from the hall and alarm the family
#nothing# said $mr_william_sikes$ releasing his hold of $oliver_twist$ now filled with this idea he advanced at once but stealthily
scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the #place# and by a loud cry which followed it $oliver_twist$ let his lantern fall and knew not whether to advance or fly
the cry was repeated a #light# appeared a vision of two terrified half dressed #man# at the top of the stairs swam before his #eye# a flash a loud noise a smoke a crash somewhere but where he knew not and he staggered back
$mr_william_sikes$ had disappeared for an instant but he was up again and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away
come back suddenly cried $mr_william_sikes$ aloud back back he fired his own pistol after the #man# who were already retreating and dragged the #boy# up
clasp your #arm# tighter said $mr_william_sikes$ as he drew him through the #window# give me a shawl here they ve hit him
then came the loud ringing of a bell mingled with the noise of #fire# #arm# and the shouts of #man# and the sensation of being carried over uneven #ground# at a rapid pace
and then the noises grew confused in the distance and a cold deadly feeling crept over the #boy# #heart# and he saw or heard no more
quick how the #boy# bleeds #chapter# xxiii which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between $mr_bumble$ and a #lady# and shows that even a #beadle#
the snow lay on the #ground# frozen into a hard thick crust so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and #corner# were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad which as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found caught it savagely up in clouds and whirling it into a thousand misty eddies scattered it in #air#
bleak dark and piercing cold it was a #night# for the well housed and fed to draw round the bright #fire# and thank god they were at home and for the homeless starving wretch to lay him down and die
many hunger worn outcasts close their #eye# in our bare #street# at such #time# who let their crimes have been what they may can hardly open them in a more bitter world
such was the aspect of out of #door# affairs when $mrs_corney$ the #matron# of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of $oliver_twist$ sat herself down before a cheerful #fire# in her own little #room# and glanced with no small degree of complacency at a small round #table# on which stood a tray of corresponding size furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that #matron# enjoy
may be susceptible on some points the #night# was bitter cold in fact $mrs_corney$ was about to solace herself with a cup of tea
as she glanced from the #table# to the fireplace where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small #voice# her inward satisfaction evidently increased so much so indeed that $mrs_corney$ smiled
well said the #matron# leaning her elbow on the #table# and looking reflectively at the #fire# i sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for
$mrs_corney$ shook her #head# mournfully as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it and thrusting a silver spoon private property into the inmost recesses of a two ounce tin tea caddy proceeded to make the tea
a great deal if we did but know it ah how slight a #thing# will disturb the equanimity of our frail #mind#
the black teapot being very small and easily filled ran over while $mrs_corney$ was moralising and the #water# slightly scalded $mrs_corney$ #hand#
drat the pot said the worthy #matron# setting it down very hastily on the hob a little stupid #thing# that only holds a couple of cups
what use is it of to anybody except said $mrs_corney$ pausing except to a poor desolate creature like me oh #dear#
with these #word# the #matron# dropped into her #chair# and once more resting her elbow on the #table# #thought# of her solitary fate
the small teapot and the single cup had awakened in her #mind# sad recollections of mr $mrs_corney$ who had not been dead more than five and twenty #year# and she was overpowered
i shall never get another said $mrs_corney$ pettishly i shall never get another like him whether this remark bore reference to the husband or the teapot is uncertain
it might have been the latter for $mrs_corney$ looked at it as she spoke and took it up afterwards she had just tasted her first cup when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the #room# #door#
oh come in with you said $mrs_corney$ sharply some of the old #woman# dying i suppose they always die when i at meals
dont stand there letting the cold #air# in dont what amiss now eh #nothing# ma am #nothing# replied a #man# #voice#
#dear# me exclaimed the #matron# in a much sweeter tone is that $mr_bumble$ at your service ma am said $mr_bumble$ who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean and to shake the snow off his coat and who now made his appearance bearing the cocked #hat# in #one# #hand# and a bundle in the other
the #lady# modestly hesitated to reply lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with $mr_bumble$ with closed #door#
shall i shut the #door# ma am $mr_bumble$ taking advantage of the hesitation and being very cold himself shut it without permission
we have given away $mrs_corney$ we have given away a #matter# of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very blessed afternoon and yet them
hard weather $mr_bumble$ said the #matron# hard indeed ma am replied the #beadle# anti porochial weather this ma am paupers are not contented
of course not when would they be $mr_bumble$ said the #matron# sipping her tea when indeed ma am rejoined $mr_bumble$
why here #one# #man# that in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese full weight
is he grateful ma am is he grateful not a copper farthing worth of it what does he do ma am but ask for a few coals if it only a #pocket# handkerchief full he says
that the #way# with these #people# ma am give em a apron full of coals to #day# and they ll come back for another the #day# after to morrow as brazen as alabaster
coals what would he do with coals toast his cheese with em and then come back for more the #matron# expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile and the #beadle# went on
the #day# afore yesterday a #man# you have been a married #woman# ma am and i may mention it to you a #man# with hardly a rag upon his back
here $mrs_corney$ looked at the floor goes to our overseer #door# when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be relieved $mrs_corney$
as he wouldnt go away and shocked the company very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal
i never said $mr_bumble$ see #anything# like the pitch it got to my #heart# says the ungrateful villain what the use of this to me
you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles very good says our overseer taking em away again you wont get #anything# else here
then i ll die in the #street# says the vagrant oh no you wont says our overseer ha
ha that was very good so like mr grannett wasnt it interposed the #matron# well $mr_bumble$ well ma am rejoined the #beadle# he went away and he did die in the #street#
there a obstinate pauper for you it beats #anything# i could have believed observed the #matron# emphatically but dont you think out of #door# relief a very bad #thing# any #way# $mr_bumble$
$mrs_corney$ said the #beadle# smiling as #man# smile who are conscious of superior information out of #door# relief properly managed properly managed ma am is the porochial safeguard
the great principle of out of #door# relief is to give the paupers exactly what they dont want and then they get tired of coming
you re a #gentleman# of experience and ought to know come #dear# me exclaimed $mrs_corney$ well that is a good #one# too
betwixt you and me ma am returned $mr_bumble$ that the great principle and that the reason why if you #look# at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers you ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese
but however said the #beadle# stopping to unpack his bundle these are official secrets ma am not to be spoken of except as i may say among the porochial officers such as ourselves
this is the port wine ma am that the board ordered for the infirmary real fresh genuine port wine only out of the cask this forenoon clear as a bell and no sediment
having held the first bottle up to the #light# and shaken it well to test its excellence $mr_bumble$ placed them both on top of a chest of drawers folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped put it carefully in his #pocket# and took up his #hat# as if to go
yes that the rule now $mrs_corney$ all over the country you ll have a very cold walk $mr_bumble$ said the #matron#
the #matron# looked from the little kettle to the #beadle# who was moving towards the #door# and as the #beadle# coughed preparatory to bidding her good #night# bashfully inquired whether whether he wouldnt take a cup of tea
$mr_bumble$ instantaneously turned back his collar again laid his #hat# and stick upon a #chair# and drew another #chair# up to the #table#
it blows ma am replied $mr_bumble$ turning up his coat collar enough to cut #one# ears off as he slowly seated himself he looked at the #lady#
she fixed her #eye# upon the little teapot $mr_bumble$ coughed again and slightly smiled $mrs_corney$ $miss_rose$ to get another cup and saucer from the closet
as she sat down her #eye# once again encountered those of the gallant #beadle# she coloured and applied herself to the task of making his tea
again $mr_bumble$ coughed louder this #time# than he had coughed yet sweet $mr_bumble$ inquired the #matron# taking up the sugar basin
he fixed his #eye# on $mrs_corney$ as he said this and if ever a #beadle# looked tender $mr_bumble$ was that #beadle# at that #moment#
$mr_bumble$ having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts began to eat and drink varying these amusements occasionally by fetching a deep sigh which however had no injurious effect upon his appetite but on the contrary rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department
you have a cat ma am i see said $mr_bumble$ glancing at #one# who in the centre of her family was basking before the #fire# and kittens too i declare
very sweet indeed ma am replied $mr_bumble$ the tea was made and handed in #silence# i am so fond of them $mr_bumble$ you cant think replied the #matron#
they re so happy so frolicsome and so cheerful that they are quite #companion# for me very nice animals ma am replied $mr_bumble$ approvingly so very domestic
oh yes rejoined the #matron# with enthusiasm so fond of their home too that it quite a pleasure i sure
$mrs_corney$ ma am said $mr_bumble$ slowly and marking the #time# with his teaspoon i mean to say this ma am that any cat or kitten that could live with you ma am and not be fond of its home must be a ass ma am
it of no use disguising facts ma am said $mr_bumble$ slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive i would drown it myself with pleasure
then you re a cruel #man# said the #matron# vivaciously as she held out her #hand# for the #beadle# cup and a very hard hearted #man# besides
$mr_bumble$ resigned his cup without another #word# squeezed $mrs_corney$ little finger as she took it and inflicting two open handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat gave a mighty sigh and hitched his #chair# a very little morsel farther from the #fire#
it was a round #table# and as $mrs_corney$ and $mr_bumble$ had been sitting opposite each other with no great space between them and fronting the #fire# it will be seen that $mr_bumble$ in receding from the #fire# and still keeping at the #table# increased the distance between himself and $mrs_corney$ which proceeding some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire and to consider an act of great heroism on $mr_bumble$ #part# he being in some sort tempted by #time# #place# and opportunity to give utterance to certain soft #nothing# which however well they may become the lips of the #light# and thoughtless do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land members of parliament ministers of state lord mayors and other great public functionaries but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a #beadle# who as is well known should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all
whatever were $mr_bumble$ intentions however and no doubt they were of the best it unfortunately happened as has been twice before remarked that the #table# was a round #one# consequently $mr_bumble$ moving his #chair# by little and little soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the #matron# and continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle brought his #chair# in #time# close to that in which the #matron# was seated
oh $mr_bumble$ remonstrated $mrs_corney$ hard hearted ma am said $mr_bumble$ hard indeed the two #chair# touched and when they did so $mr_bumble$ stopped
now if the #matron# had moved her #chair# to the right she would have been scorched by the #fire# and if to the left she must have fallen into $mr_bumble$ #arm# so being a discreet #matron# and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance
hard hearted $mrs_corney$ said $mr_bumble$ stirring his tea and looking up into the #matron# #face# are you hard hearted $mrs_corney$
she remained where she was and handed $mr_bumble$ another cup of tea #dear# me exclaimed the #matron# what a very curious question from a single #man#
the #beadle# drank his tea to the last drop finished a piece of toast whisked the crumbs off his knees wiped his lips and deliberately kissed the #matron#
$mr_bumble$ cried that discreet #lady# in a whisper for the fright was so great that she had quite lost her #voice# $mr_bumble$ i shall scream
what can you want to know for $mr_bumble$ mr $mr_bumble$ made no reply but in a slow and dignified #manner# put his #arm# round the #matron# waist
as the #lady# had stated her intention of screaming of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the #door# which was no sooner heard than $mr_bumble$ darted with much agility to the wine bottles and began dusting them with great violence while the #matron# sharply demanded who was there
it is worthy of remark as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear that her #voice# had quite recovered all its official asperity
if you please mistress said a withered old female pauper hideously ugly putting her #head# in at the #door# old sally is a going fast
well what that to me angrily demanded the #matron# i cant keep her alive can i no no mistress replied the old #woman# nobody can she far beyond the reach of help
i ve seen a many #people# die little babes and great strong #man# and i know when #death# a coming well enough but she troubled in her #mind# and when the fits are not on her and
that not often for she is dying very hard she says she has got #something# to tell which you must hear she ll never die quiet till you come mistress
at this intelligence the worthy $mrs_corney$ muttered a variety of invectives against old #woman# who couldnt even die without purposely annoying their betters and muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up briefly requested $mr_bumble$ to stay till she came back lest #anything# particular should occur
bidding the messenger walk fast and not be all #night# hobbling up the stairs she followed her from the #room# with a very ill grace scolding all the #way#
he opened the closet counted the teaspoons weighed the sugar tongs closely inspected a silver milk pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal and having satisfied his curiosity on these points put on his cocked #hat# #corner# wise and danced with much gravity four distinct #time# round the #table#
having gone through this very extraordinary performance he took off the cocked #hat# again and spreading himself before the #fire# with his back towards it seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture
$mr_bumble$ conduct on being left to himself was rather inexplicable #chapter# xxiv treats on a very poor subject but is a short #one# and may be found of importance in this history
her body was bent by age her limbs trembled with palsy her #face# distorted into a mumbling leer resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil than the work of nature #hand#
it was no unfit messenger of #death# who had disturbed the quiet of the #matron# #room# alas how few of nature #face# are left alone to gladden us with their beauty
the cares and sorrows and hungerings of the world change them as they change #heart# and it is only when those passions sleep and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass off and leave heaven surface clear
it is a common #thing# for the countenances of the dead even in that fixed and rigid state to subside into the long forgotten expression of sleeping infancy and settle into the very #look# of early #life# so calm so peaceful do they grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood kneel by the coffin #side# in awe and see the angel even upon earth
the old crone tottered along the passages and up the stairs muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her #companion# being at #length# compelled to pause for breath she gave the #light# into her #hand# and remained behind to follow as she might while the more nimble superior made her #way# to the #room# where the sick #woman# lay
there was another old #woman# watching by the #bed# the parish apothecary apprentice was standing by the #fire# making a toothpick out of a quill
it was a bare garret #room# with a dim #light# burning at the farther end cold #night# $mrs_corney$ said this young #gentleman# as the #matron# entered
very cold indeed #sir# replied the mistress in her most civil tones and dropping a curtsey as she spoke
you should get better coals out of your contractors said the apothecary deputy breaking a lump on the top of the #fire# with the rusty poker these are not at all the sort of #thing# for a cold #night#
they re the board choosing #sir# returned the #matron# the least they could do would be to keep us pretty warm for our #place# are hard enough
oh said the young mag turning his #face# towards the #bed# as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient it all p there $mrs_corney$
the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick #woman# it is is it #sir# asked the #matron#
if she lasts a couple of #hour# i shall be surprised said the apothecary apprentice intent upon the toothpick point
it a break up of the system altogether is she dozing old #lady# the attendant stooped over the #bed# to ascertain and nodded in the affirmative
then perhaps she ll go off in that #way# if you dont make a row said the young #man# put the #light# on the floor
the attendant did as she was told shaking her #head# meanwhile to intimate that the #woman# would not die so easily having done so she resumed her seat by the #side# of the other nurse who had by this #time# returned
she wont see it there the mistress with an expression of impatience wrapped herself in her shawl and sat at the #foot# of the #bed#
the apothecary apprentice having completed the manufacture of the toothpick planted himself in front of the #fire# and made good use of it for ten #minute# or so when apparently growing rather dull he wished $mrs_corney$ joy of her job and took himself off on tiptoe
when they had sat in #silence# for some #time# the two old #woman# $miss_rose$ from the #bed# and crouching over the #fire# held out their withered #hand# to catch the heat
the flame threw a ghastly #light# on their shrivelled #face# and made their ugliness appear terrible as in this position they began to converse in a low #voice#
did she say any more anny #dear# while i was gone inquired the messenger not a #word# replied the other
she plucked and tore at her #arm# for a little #time# but i held her #hand# and she soon dropped off
she hasnt much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet i aint so weak for an old #woman# although i am on parish allowance no no
did she drink the hot wine the #doctor# said she was to have demanded the first i tried to get it down rejoined the other
but her teeth were tight set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i could do to get it back again
looking cautiously round to ascertain that they were not overheard the two hags cowered nearer to the #fire# and chuckled heartily
i #mind# the #time# said the first speaker when she would have done the same and made rare fun of it afterwards
so i drank it and it did me good ay that she would rejoined the other she had a merry #heart#
my old #eye# have seen them ay and those old #hand# touched them too for i have helped her scores of #time#
stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke the old creature shook them exultingly before her #face# and fumbling in her #pocket# brought out an old #time# discoloured tin snuff box from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her #companion# and a few more into her own
while they were thus employed the #matron# who had been impatiently watching until the dying #woman# should awaken from her stupor joined them by the #fire# and sharply asked how long she was to wait
a many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as waxwork not long mistress replied the second #woman# looking up into her #face#
we have none of us long to wait for #death# patience patience he ll be here soon enough for us all hold your tongue you doting idiot said the #matron# sternly
but will never be again added the second #one# that is she ll never wake again but once and #mind# mistress that wont be for long
long or short said the #matron# snappishly she wont find me here when she does wake take care both of you how you worry me again for #nothing#
you martha tell me has she been in this #way# before often answered the first #woman# it no #part# of my duty to see all the old #woman# in the #house# die and i wont
that more #mind# that you impudent old harridans if you make a fool of me again i ll soon cure you i warrant you
she was bouncing away when a cry from the two #woman# who had turned towards the #bed# caused her to #look# round
the patient had raised herself upright and was stretching her #arm# towards them who that she cried in a hollow #voice#
hush hush said #one# of the #woman# stooping over her lie down lie down i ll never lie down again alive said the #woman# struggling
she clutched the #matron# by the #arm# and forcing her into a #chair# by the bedside was about to speak when looking round she caught sight of the two old #woman# bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners
i will tell her come here nearer let me whisper in your ear turn them away said the #woman# drowsily make haste
the two old crones chiming in together began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor #dear# was too far gone to know her best #friend# and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her when the superior pushed them from the #room# closed the #door# and returned to the bedside
on being excluded the old #lady# changed their tone and cried through the keyhole that old sally was drunk which indeed was not unlikely since in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin and #water# which had been privily administered in the openness of their #heart# by the worthy old #lady# themselves
now listen to me said the dying #woman# aloud as if making a great effort to revive #one# latent spark of energy
in this very #room# in this very #bed# i once nursed a pretty young creetur that was brought into the #house# with her #foot# cut and bruised with walking and all soiled with dust and blood
make haste she gave birth to a #boy# and died let me think what was the #year# again never #mind# the #year# said the impatient auditor what about her
ay murmured the sick #woman# relapsing into her former drowsy state what about her what about i know she cried jumping fiercely up her #face# flushed and her #eye# starting from her #head# i robbed her so i did
she wasnt cold i tell you she wasnt cold when i stole it stole what for god sake cried the #matron# with a gesture as if she would call for help
she wanted clothes to keep her warm and food to eat but she had kept it safe and had it in her bosom
it replied the #woman# laying her #hand# over the other mouth the only #thing# she had it was gold i tell you
rich gold that might have saved her #life# gold echoed the #matron# bending eagerly over the #woman# as she fell back
she charged me to keep it safe replied the #woman# with a groan and trusted me as the only #woman# about her
i stole it in my #heart# when she first showed it me hanging round her neck and the #child# #death# perhaps is on me besides
go on go on yes what of it who was the #mother# when was it they would have treated him better if they had known it all known what asked the other
the #boy# grew so like his #mother# said the #woman# rambling on and not heeding the question that i could never forget it when i saw his #face#
speak poor #girl# poor #girl# she was so young too such a gentle lamb wait there more to tell i have not told you all have i
no no replied the #matron# inclining her #head# to catch the #word# as they came more faintly from the dying #woman#
the #mother# said the #woman# making a more violent effort than before the #mother# when the pains of #death# first came upon her whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive and thrived the #day# might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young #mother# named
she said folding her thin #hand# together whether it be #boy# or #girl# raise up some #friend# for it in this troubled world and take pity upon a lonely desolate #child# abandoned to its mercy the #boy# #name# demanded the #matron#
be quick or it may be too late and oh kind heaven they called him $oliver_twist$ replied the #woman# feebly
she was bending eagerly over the #woman# to hear her reply but drew back instinctively as she once again $miss_rose$ slowly and stiffly into a sitting posture then clutching the coverlid with both #hand# muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat and fell lifeless on the #bed#
the gold i stole was yes yes what cried the other stone dead said #one# of the old #woman# hurrying in as soon as the #door# was opened
the two crones to all appearance too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply were left alone hovering about the body
and #nothing# to tell after all rejoined the #matron# walking carelessly away #chapter# xxv wherein this history reverts to $mr_fagin$ and company
while these #thing# were passing in the country workhouse $mr_fagin$ sat in the old den the same from which $oliver_twist$ had been removed by the #girl# brooding over a dull smoky #fire#
he held a pair of bellows upon his knee with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action but he had fallen into deep #thought# and with his #arm# folded on them and his chin resting on his thumbs fixed his #eye# abstractedly on the rusty bars
at a #table# behind him sat the artful dodger #master# charles $charley_bates$ and $mr_chitling$ all intent upon a game of whist the artful taking dummy against #master# $charley_bates$ and $mr_chitling$
the countenance of the first named #gentleman# peculiarly intelligent at all #time# acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game and his attentive perusal of $mr_chitling$ #hand# upon which from #time# to #time# as occasion served he bestowed a variety of earnest glances wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour cards
he also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the #table# which stood ready filled with gin and #water# for the accommodation of the company
#master# $charley_bates$ was also attentive to the play but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished #friend# it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin and #water# and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber
indeed the artful presuming upon their close attachment more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his #companion# upon these improprieties all of which remonstrances #master# $charley_bates$ received in extremely good #part# merely requesting his #friend# to be blowed or to insert his #head# in a sack or replying with some other neatly turned witticism of a similar kind the happy application of which excited considerable admiration in the #mind# of $mr_chitling$
it was remarkable that the latter #gentleman# and his partner invariably lost and that the circumstance so far from angering #master# $charley_bates$ appeared to afford him the highest amusement inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born #day#
that two doubles and the rub said $mr_chitling$ with a very long #face# as he drew half a crown from his waistcoat #pocket#
it being a cold #night# the dodger wore his #hat# as indeed was often his custom within #door# i never see such a feller as you jack you win everything
either the #master# or the #manner# of this remark which was made very ruefully delighted $charley_bates$ so much that his consequent shout of laughter roused the jew from his reverie and induced him to inquire what was the #matter#
even when we ve good cards $charley_bates$ and i cant make #nothing# of em #matter# $mr_fagin$ cried $charley_bates$ i wish you had watched the play
ay ay said the jew with a grin which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason
tommy $mr_chitling$ hasnt won a point and i went partners with him against the artfull and dumb try em again $tom_white$ try em again
no more of it for me thank ee $mr_fagin$ replied $mr_chitling$ i ve had enough that ere dodger has such a run of luck that there no standing again him
ha ha my #dear# replied the jew you must get up very early in the #morning# to win against the dodger
#morning# said $charley_bates$ you must put your boots on over #night# and have a telescope at each #eye# and a opera glass between your shoulders if you want to come over him
$mr_john_dawkins$ received these handsome compliments with much philosophy and offered to cut any #gentleman# in company for the first picture card at a shilling at a #time#
nobody accepting the challenge and his pipe being by this #time# smoked out he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a #ground# plan of newgate on the #table# with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters whistling meantime with peculiar shrillness
how precious dull you are tommy said the dodger stopping short when there had been a long #silence# and addressing $mr_chitling$
what do you think he thinking of $mr_fagin$ how should i know my #dear# replied the jew looking round as he plied the bellows
is that it my #dear# not a bit of it replied the dodger stopping the subject of discourse as $mr_chitling$ was about to reply
about his losses maybe or the little retirement in the country that he just left eh ha ha what do you say $charley_bates$
i should say replied #master# $charley_bates$ with a grin that he was uncommon sweet upon betsy see how he a blushing oh my #eye#
thoroughly overpowered with the notion of $mr_chitling$ being the victim of the tender passion #master# $charley_bates$ threw himself back in his #chair# with such violence that he lost his balance and pitched over upon the floor where the accident abating #nothing# of his merriment he lay at full #length# until his laugh was over when he resumed his former position and began another laugh
never #mind# him my #dear# said the jew winking at $mr_john_dawkins$ and giving #master# $charley_bates$ a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows
here a merry go rounder tommy $mr_chitling$ in love oh $mr_fagin$ $mr_fagin$ what a spree betsy a fine #girl# stick up to her $tom_white$
what i mean to say $mr_fagin$ replied $mr_chitling$ very red in the #face# is that that isnt #anything# to anybody here
stick up to her no more it is replied the jew $charley_bates$ will talk dont #mind# him my #dear# dont #mind# him
so i do do as she bids me replied $mr_chitling$ i shouldnt have been milled if it hadnt been for her advice
betsy a fine #girl# do as she bids you $tom_white$ and you will make your fortune but it turned out a good job for you didnt it $mr_fagin$
it must come some #time# or another and why not in the winter #time# when you dont want to go out a walking so much eh $mr_fagin$
you wouldnt #mind# it again $tom_white$ would you asked the dodger winking upon $charley_bates$ and the jew if bet was all right
and what six weeks of it ah to be sure my #dear# replied the jew i mean to say that i shouldnt replied $tom_white$ angrily
there now ah who ll say as much as that i should like to know eh $mr_fagin$ nobody my #dear# replied the jew not a soul $tom_white$
i dont know #one# of em that would do it besides you not #one# of em my #dear# i might have got clear off if i split upon her mightnt i $mr_fagin$
a #word# from me would have done it wouldnt it $mr_fagin$ to be sure it would my #dear# replied the jew
angrily pursued the poor half witted dupe but i didnt blab it did i $mr_fagin$ demanded $tom_white$ pouring question upon question with great volubility
a deal too stout my #dear# perhaps i was rejoined $tom_white$ looking round and if i was what to laugh at in that eh $mr_fagin$
the jew perceiving that $mr_chitling$ was considerably roused hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing and to prove the gravity of the company appealed to #master# $charley_bates$ the principal offender
but unfortunately $charley_bates$ in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his #life# was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar that the abused $mr_chitling$ without any preliminary ceremonies rushed across the #room# and aimed a blow at the offender who being skilful in evading pursuit ducked to avoid it and chose his #time# so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old #gentleman# and caused him to stagger to the wall where he stood panting for breath while $mr_chitling$ looked on in intense dismay
no no to be sure replied the jew you were too stout hearted for that hark cried the dodger at this #moment#
i heard the tinkler catching up the #light# he crept softly upstairs the bell was rung again with some impatience while the party were in darkness
the dodger nodded in the affirmative and shading the flame of the candle with his #hand# gave $charley_bates$ a private intimation in dumb show that he had better not be funny just then
after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered $mr_fagin$ mysteriously what cried the jew alone having performed this friendly office he fixed his #eye# on the jew #face# and awaited his directions
the old #man# bit his yellow fingers and meditated for some seconds his #face# working with agitation the while as if he dreaded #something# and feared to know the worst
at #length# he raised his #head# where is he he asked the dodger pointed to the floor above and made a gesture as if to leave the #room#
yes said the jew answering the mute inquiry bring him down hush quiet $charley_bates$ gently $tom_white$ scarce scarce this brief direction to $charley_bates$ and his recent antagonist was softly and immediately obeyed
there was no sound of their whereabout when the dodger descended the stairs bearing the #light# in his #hand# and followed by a #man# in a coarse smock frock who after casting a hurried glance round the #room# pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his #face# and disclosed all haggard unwashed and unshorn the features of flash $mr_toby_crackit$
how are you faguey said this worthy nodding to the jew pop that shawl away in my castor dodger so that i may know where to find it when i cut
with these #word# he pulled up the smock frock and winding it round his middle drew a #chair# to the #fire# and placed his #foot# upon the hob
see there faguey he said pointing disconsolately to his top boots not a drop of #day# and martin since you know when not a bubble of blacking by jove
that the #time# of #day# you ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now but dont #look# at me in that #way# #man#
i cant talk about business till i ve eat and drank so produce the sustainance and let have a quiet fill out for the first #time# these three #day#
the jew motioned to the dodger to #place# what eatables there were upon the #table# and seating himself opposite the housebreaker waited his leisure
at first the jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought but in vain
he looked tired and worn but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore and through dirt and beard and whisker there still shone unimpaired the self satisfied smirk of flash $mr_toby_crackit$
then the jew in an agony of impatience watched every morsel he put into his mouth pacing up and down the #room# meanwhile in irrepressible excitement
all in good #time# to judge from appearances $mr_toby_crackit$ was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation it was all of no use
$mr_toby_crackit$ continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference until he could eat no more then ordering the dodger out he closed the #door# mixed a glass of spirits and #water# and composed himself for talking
$mr_toby_crackit$ stopped to take a draught of spirits and #water# and to declare that the gin was excellent then placing his #foot# against the low mantelpiece so as to bring his boots to about the level of his #eye# he quietly resumed
first and foremost faguey said $mr_toby_crackit$ yes yes interposed the jew drawing up his #chair# first and foremost faguey said the housebreaker how $bill_sikes$
what screamed the jew starting from his seat why you dont mean to say began $mr_toby_crackit$ turning pale mean cried the jew stamping furiously on the #ground#
where are they $mr_william_sikes$ and the #boy# where are they where have they been where are they hiding why have they not been here
the crack failed said $mr_toby_crackit$ faintly i know it replied the jew tearing a newspaper from his #pocket# and pointing to it
what more they fired and hit the #boy# we cut over the fields at the back with him between us straight as the crow flies through hedge and ditch
they gave chase damme the whole country was awake and the #dog# upon us the #boy# $bill_sikes$ had him on his back and scudded like the wind
we stopped to take him between us his #head# hung down and he was cold they were close upon our heels every #man# for himself and each from the gallows
the jew stopped to hear no more but uttering a loud yell and twining his #hand# in his hair rushed from the #room# and from the #house#
we parted company and left the youngster lying in a ditch alive or dead that all i know about him #chapter# xxvi in which
a mysterious character appears upon the scene and many #thing# inseparable from this history are done and performed the old #man# had gained the #street# #corner# before he began to recover the effect of $mr_toby_crackit$ intelligence
he had relaxed #nothing# of his unusual speed but was still pressing onward in the same wild and disordered #manner# when the sudden dashing past of a carriage and a boisterous cry from the #foot# passengers who saw his danger drove him back upon the pavement
avoiding as much as was possible all the main #street# and skulking only through the by #way# and alleys he at #length# emerged on snow hill
here he walked even faster than before nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court when as if conscious that he was now in his proper element he fell into his usual shuffling pace and seemed to breathe more freely
near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet opens upon the right #hand# as you come out of the city a narrow and dismal alley leading to saffron hill
in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second #hand# silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick #pocket#
hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the #window# or flaunting from the #door# posts and the shelves within are piled with them
it is a commercial colony of itself the emporium of petty larceny visited at early #morning# and setting in of dusk by silent merchants who traffic in dark back parlours and who go as strangely as they come
here the clothesman the shoe vamper and the rag merchant display their goods as sign boards to the petty thief here stores of old iron and bones and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen stuff and linen rust and rot in the grimy cellars
confined as the limits of field lane are it has its barber its coffee shop its beer shop and its fried fish warehouse it was into this #place# that the jew turned
he was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane for such of them as were on the #look# out to buy or sell nodded familiarly as he passed along
he replied to their salutations in the same #way# but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley when he stopped to address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his #person# into a #child# #chair# as the #chair# would hold and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse #door#
why the sight of you $mr_fagin$ would cure the hoptalmy said this respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jew inquiry after his health
the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said $mr_fagin$ elevating his eyebrows and crossing his #hand# upon his shoulders
well i ve heerd that complaint of it once or twice before replied the trader but it soon cools down again dont you find it
so $mr_fagin$ nodded in the affirmative pointing in the direction of saffron hill he inquired whether any #one# was up yonder to #night#
at the cripples inquired the #man# the jew nodded let me see pursued the merchant reflecting yes there some half dozen of em gone in that i knows
i dont think your #friend# there $mr_william_sikes$ is not i suppose inquired the jew with a disappointed countenance non istwentus as the lawyers say replied the little #man# shaking his #head# and looking amazingly sly
have you got #anything# in my line to #night# #nothing# to #night# said the jew turning away are you going up to the cripples $mr_fagin$
but as the jew looking back waved his #hand# to intimate that he preferred being alone and moreover as the little #man# could not very easily disengage himself from the #chair# the sign of the cripples was for a #time# bereft of the advantage of mr lively presence
by the #time# he had got upon his legs the jew had disappeared so mr lively after ineffectually standing on tiptoe in the hope of catching sight of him again forced himself into the little #chair# and exchanging a shake of the #head# with a #lady# in the opposite shop in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour
the three cripples or rather the cripples which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons was the public #house# in which $mr_william_sikes$ and his #dog# have already figured
merely making a sign to a #man# at the bar $mr_fagin$ walked straight upstairs and opening the #door# of a #room# and softly insinuating himself into the chamber looked anxiously about shading his #eye# with his #hand# as if in search of some particular #person#
the #room# was illuminated by two gas #light# the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters and closely drawn curtains of faded red from being visible outside
the ceiling was blackened to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps and the #place# was so full of dense tobacco smoke that at first it was scarcely possible to discern #anything# more
by degrees however as some of it cleared away through the open #door# an assemblage of #head# as confused as the noises that greeted the ear might be made out and as the #eye# grew more accustomed to the scene the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company male and female crowded round a long #table# at the upper end of which sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his #hand# while a professional #gentleman# with a bluish nose and his #face# tied up for the benefit of a toothache presided at a jingling piano in a remote #corner#
as $mr_fagin$ stepped softly in the professional #gentleman# running over the keys by #way# of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a song which having subsided a young #lady# proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through as loud as he could
when this was over the chairman gave a sentiment after which the professional #gentleman# on the chairman right and left volunteered a duet and sang it with great applause
cried the little #man# calling after him stop i dont #mind# if i have a drop there with you it was curious to observe some #face# which stood out prominently from among the group
there was the chairman himself the landlord of the #house# a coarse rough heavy built fellow who while the songs were proceeding rolled his #eye# hither and thither and seeming to give himself up to joviality had an #eye# for everything that was done and an ear for everything that was said and sharp #one# too
near him were the singers receiving with professional indifference the compliments of the company and applying themselves in turn to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and #water# tendered by their more boisterous admirers whose countenances expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade irresistibly attracted the attention by their very repulsiveness
cunning ferocity and drunkeness in all its stages were there in their strongest aspect and #woman# some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out and presenting but #one# loathsome blank of profligacy and crime some mere #girl# others but young #woman# and none past the prime of #life# formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture
$mr_fagin$ troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from #face# to #face# while these proceedings were in progress but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search
succeeding at #length# in catching the #eye# of the #man# who occupied the #chair# he beckoned to him slightly and left the #room# as quietly as he had entered it
what can i do for you $mr_fagin$ inquired the #man# as he followed him out to the landing wont you join us
they ll be delighted every #one# of em the jew shook his #head# impatiently and said in a whisper is he here
no replied the #man# and no news of $barney$ inquired $mr_fagin$ none replied the landlord of the cripples for it was he
depend on it they re on the scent down there and that if he moved he blow upon the #thing# at once
he wont stir till it all safe he all right enough $barney$ is else i should have heard of him i ll pound it that $barney$ managing properly
let him alone for that will he be here to #night# asked the jew laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before
monks do you mean inquired the landlord hesitating hush said the jew yes certain replied the #man# drawing a gold watch from his fob i expected him here before now
no no said the jew hastily as though however desirous he might be to see the #person# in question he was nevertheless relieved by his absence
if you ll wait ten #minute# he ll be tell him i came here to see him and that he must come to me to #night#
no say to morrow as he is not here to morrow will be #time# enough good said the #man# #nothing# more not a #word# now said the jew descending the stairs
i say said the other looking over the rails and speaking in a hoarse whisper what a #time# this would be for a sell
i ve got phil barker here so drunk that a #boy# might take him ah but it not phil barker #time# said the jew looking up
phil has #something# more to do before we can afford to #part# with him so go back to the company my #dear# and tell them to lead merry #life# while they last
ha ha ha the landlord reciprocated the old #man# laugh and returned to his guests the jew was no sooner alone than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and #thought#
he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of $mr_william_sikes$ residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on #foot#
now muttered the jew as he knocked at the #door# if there is any deep play here i shall have it out of you my #girl# cunning as you are
after a brief reflection he called a hack cabriolet and bade the #man# drive towards bethnal green she was in her #room# the #woman# said
$mr_fagin$ crept softly upstairs and entered it without any previous ceremony the #girl# was alone lying with her #head# upon the #table# and her hair straggling over it
she has been drinking #thought# the jew cooly or perhaps she is only miserable the old #man# turned to close the #door# as he made this reflection the noise thus occasioned roused the #girl#
she eyed his crafty #face# narrowly as she inquired to his recital of $mr_toby_crackit$ story when it was concluded she sank into her former attitude but spoke not a #word#
she pushed the candle impatiently away and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position shuffled her #foot# upon the #ground# but this was all
during the #silence# the jew looked restlessly about the #room# as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of $mr_william_sikes$ having covertly returned
apparently satisfied with his inspection he coughed twice or thrice and made as many efforts to open a conversation but the #girl# heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone
at #length# he made another attempt and rubbing his #hand# together said in his most conciliatory tone and where should you think $bill_sikes$ was now my #dear#
the #girl# moaned out some half intelligible reply that she could not tell and seemed from the smothered noise that escaped her to be crying
and the #boy# too said the jew straining his #eye# to catch a glimpse of her #face# poor leetle #child#
the #child# said the #girl# suddenly looking up is better where he is than among us and if no harm comes to $bill_sikes$ from it i hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there
left in a ditch nance only think what cried the jew in amazement ay i do returned the #girl# meeting his gaze
i shall be glad to have him away from my #eye# and to know that the worst is over i cant bear to have him about me
the sight of him turns me against myself and all of you pooh said the jew scornfully you re drunk am i cried the #girl# bitterly
it no fault of yours if i am not you never have me #anything# else if you had your will except now the humour doesnt suit you doesnt it
no rejoined the jew furiously it does not change it then responded the #girl# with a laugh change it
exclaimed the jew exasperated beyond all bounds by his #companion# unexpected obstinacy and the vexation of the #night# i will change it
listen to me who with six #word# can strangle $mr_william_sikes$ as surely as if i had his bull throat between my fingers now
if he comes back and leaves the #boy# behind him if he gets off free and dead or alive fails to restore him to me murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch
listen to me you drab and do it the #moment# he sets #foot# in this #room# or #mind# me it will be too late
when the #boy# worth hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the #way# of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could whistle away the #life# of
and me bound too to a born devil that only wants the will and has the power to to panting for breath the old #man# stammered for a #word# and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath and changed his whole demeanour
a #moment# before his clenched #hand# had grasped the #air# his #eye# had dilated and his #face# grown livid with passion but now he shrunk into a #chair# and cowering together trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy
what is all this cried the #girl# involuntarily what is it pursued $mr_fagin$ mad with rage after a short #silence# he ventured to #look# round at his #companion#
he appeared somewhat reassured on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her $miss_nancy$ #dear# croaked the jew in his usual #voice#
did you #mind# me #dear# dont worry me now $mr_fagin$ replied the #girl# raising her #head# languidly if $bill_sikes$ has not done it this #time# he will another
he has done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can and when he cant he wont so no more about that regarding this #boy# my #dear# said the jew rubbing the palms of his #hand# nervously together
the #boy# must take his chance with the rest interrupted $miss_nancy$ hastily and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harm #way# and out of yours that is if $bill_sikes$ comes to no harm
and if $mr_toby_crackit$ got clear off $bill_sikes$ pretty sure to be safe for $bill_sikes$ worth two of $mr_toby_crackit$ any #time# and about what i was saying my #dear# observed the jew keeping his glistening #eye# steadily upon her
you must say it all over again if it #anything# you want me to do rejoined $miss_nancy$ and if it is you had better wait till to morrow
$mr_fagin$ put several other questions all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the #girl# had profited by his unguarded hints but she answered them so readily and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching #look# that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor was confirmed
$miss_nancy$ indeed was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the jew female pupils and in which in their tenderer #year# they were rather encouraged than checked
her disordered appearance and a wholesale perfume of geneva which pervaded the apartment afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the jew supposition and when after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described she subsided first into dullness and afterwards into a compound of feelings under the influence of which she shed #tear# #one# #minute# and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of never say die
and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a #lady# or #gentleman# was happy
$mr_fagin$ who had had considerable experience of such #matter# in his #time# saw with great satisfaction that she was very far gone indeed
having eased his #mind# by this discovery and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the #girl# what he had that #night# heard and of ascertaining with his own #eye# that $mr_william_sikes$ had not returned $mr_fagin$ again turned his #face# homeward leaving his young #friend# asleep with her #head# upon the #table#
you put me up for a #minute# but now i stupid again it was within an #hour# of midnight the weather being dark and piercing cold he had no great temptation to loiter
the sharp wind that scoured the #street# seemed to have cleared them of passengers as of dust and mud for few #people# were abroad and they were to all appearance hastening fast home
it blew from the right quarter for the jew however and straight before it he went trembling and shivering as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his #way#
he had reached the #corner# of his own #street# and was already fumbling in his #pocket# for the #door# key when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow and crossing the road glided up to him unperceived
$mr_fagin$ whispered a #voice# close to his ear ah said the jew turning quickly round is that yes interrupted the stranger
on your business my #dear# replied the jew glancing uneasily at his #companion# and slackening his pace as he spoke
i have been lingering here these two #hour# where the devil have you been on your business all #night# oh of course said the stranger with a sneer
well and what come of it #nothing# good said the jew #nothing# bad i hope said the stranger stopping short and turning a startled #look# on his #companion#
the jew shook his #head# and was about to reply when the stranger interrupting him motioned to the #house# before which they had by this #time# arrived remarking that he had better say what he had got to say under cover for his blood was chilled with standing about so long and the wind blew through him
$mr_fagin$ looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable #hour# and indeed muttered #something# about having no #fire# but his #companion# repeating his request in a peremptory #manner# he unlocked the #door# and requested him to close it softly while he got a #light#
it as dark as the grave said the #man# groping forward a few steps make haste shut the #door# whispered $mr_fagin$ from the end of the passage
as he spoke it closed with a loud noise that wasnt my doing said the other #man# feeling his #way#
the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord #one# or the other #look# sharp with the #light# or i shall knock my brains out against #something# in this confounded hole
after a short absence he returned with a lighted candle and the intelligence that $mr_toby_crackit$ was asleep in the back #room# below and that the #boy# were in the front #one#
we can say the few #word# we ve got to say in here my #dear# said the jew throwing open a #door# on the first floor
and as there are holes in the shutters and we never show #light# to our neighbours we ll set the candle on the stairs
with those #word# the jew stooping down placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs exactly opposite to the #room# #door#
this done he led the #way# into the apartment which was destitute of all movables save a broken #arm# #chair# and an old couch or sofa without covering which stood behind the #door#
upon this piece of furniture the stranger sat himself with the #air# of a weary #man# and the jew drawing up the #arm# #chair# opposite they sat #face# to #face#
it was not quite dark the #door# was partially open and the candle outside threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall
$mr_fagin$ stealthily descended the kitchen stairs beckoning the #man# to follow him he led the #way# upstairs there they conversed for some #time# in whispers
though #nothing# of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed #word# here and there a listener might easily have perceived that $mr_fagin$ appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation
they might have been talking thus for a quarter of an #hour# or more when monks by which #name# the jew had designated the strange #man# several #time# in the course of their colloquy said raising his #voice# a little i tell you again it was badly planned
why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once only hear him exclaimed the jew shrugging his shoulders
why do you mean to say you couldnt have done it if you had chosen demanded monks sternly havent you done it with other #boy# scores of #time#
if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldnt you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for #life#
whose turn would that have served my #dear# inquired the jew humbly mine replied monks but not mine said the jew submissively
when there are two parties to a bargain it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted is it my good #friend#
i saw it was not easy to train him to the business replied the jew he was not like other #boy# in the same circumstances
he might have become of use to me what then demanded monks curse him no muttered the #man# or he would have been a thief long ago
i had no hold upon him to make him worse pursued the jew anxiously watching the countenance of his #companion#
his #hand# was not in i had #nothing# to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain
what could i do send him out with the dodger and $charley_bates$ we had enough of that at first my #dear# i trembled for us all
and i dont quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped #eye# on the #boy# to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for
that was not my doing observed monks no no my #dear# renewed the jew well i got him back for you by means of the #girl# and then she begins to favour him
why we cant afford to do that just now my #dear# replied the jew smiling and besides that sort of #thing# is not in our #way# or #one# of these #day# i might be glad to have it done
throttle the #girl# said monks impatiently i know what these #girl# are monks well as soon as the #boy# begins to harden she ll care no more for him than for a block of wood
if he is alive i can make him #one# from this #time# and if if said the jew drawing nearer to the other it not likely #mind# but if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead
you want him made a thief it no fault of mine if he is interposed the other #man# with a #look# of terror and clasping the jew #arm# with trembling #hand#
#mind# that $mr_fagin$ i had no #hand# in it #anything# but his #death# i told you from the first i wont shed blood it always found out and haunts a #man# besides
what that what cried the jew grasping the coward round the body with both #arm# as he sprung to his #foot#
if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me #fire# this infernal den where yonder replied the #man# glaring at the opposite wall
the shadow i saw the shadow of a #woman# in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath
the jew released his hold and they rushed tumultuously from the #room# the candle wasted by the draught was standing where it had been placed
it showed them only the empty staircase and their own white #face# they listened intently a profound #silence# reigned throughout the #house#
it your fancy said the jew taking up the #light# and turning to his #companion# i ll swear i saw it
the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale #face# of his associate and telling him he could follow if he pleased ascended the stairs
replied monks trembling it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away they looked into all the #room# they were cold bare and empty
the green damp hung upon the low walls the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the #light# of the candle but all was still as #death#
they descended into the passage and thence into the cellars below what do you think now said the jew when they had regained the passage
as a proof of the fact the jew drew forth two keys from his #pocket# and explained that when he first went downstairs he had locked them in to prevent any intrusion on the conference
besides ourselves there not a creature in the #house# except $mr_toby_crackit$ and the #boy# and they re safe enough see here this accumulated testimony effectually staggered mr monks
his protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery and now he gave vent to several very grim laughs and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination
he declined any renewal of the conversation however for that #night# suddenly remembering that it was past #one# clock and so the amiable couple parted
as it would be by no means seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a #beadle# waiting with his back to the #fire# and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his #arm# until such #time# as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him and as it would still less become his station or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a #lady# on whom that #beadle# had looked with an #eye# of tenderness and affection and in whose ear he had whispered sweet #word# which coming from such a quarter might well thrill the bosom of maid or #matron# of whatsoever degree the historian whose pen traces these #word# trusting that he knows his #place# and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank and by consequence great virtues imperatively claim at his #hand#
towards this end indeed he had purposed to introduce in this #place# a dissertation touching the divine right of #beadle# and elucidative of the position that a #beadle# can do no wrong which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled by want of #time# and space to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity on the arrival of which he will be prepared to show that a #beadle# properly constituted that is to say a parochial #beadle# attached to a parochial workhouse and attending in his official capacity the parochial church is in right and virtue of his office possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity and that to none of those excellences can mere companies #beadle# or court of law #beadle# or even chapel of ease #beadle# save the last and
#chapter# xxvii atones for the unpoliteness of a former #chapter# which deserted a #lady# most unceremoniously they in a very lowly and inferior degree lay the remotest sustainable claim
$mr_bumble$ had re counted the teaspoons re weighed the sugar tongs made a closer inspection of the milk pot and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture down to the very horse hair seats of the #chair# and had repeated each process full half a dozen #time# before he began to think that it was #time# for $mrs_corney$ to return
thinking begets thinking as there were no sounds of $mrs_corney$ approach it occured to $mr_bumble$ that it would be an innocent and virtuous #way# of spending the #time# if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of $mrs_corney$ chest of drawers
having listened at the keyhole to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber $mr_bumble$ beginning at the bottom proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers which being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers speckled with dried lavender seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction
arriving in course of #time# at the right #hand# #corner# drawer in which was the key and beholding therein a small padlocked box which being shaken gave forth a pleasant sound as of the chinking of coin $mr_bumble$ returned with a stately walk to the fireplace and resuming his old attitude said with a grave and determined #air# i ll do it
he followed up this remarkable declaration by shaking his #head# in a waggish #manner# for ten #minute# as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant #dog# and then he took a view of his legs in profile with much seeming pleasure and interest
he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey when $mrs_corney$ hurrying into the #room# threw herself in a breathless state on a #chair# by the fireside and covering her #eye# with #one# #hand# placed the other over her #heart# and gasped for breath
pray answer me i on on $mr_bumble$ in his alarm could not immediately think of the #word# tenterhooks so he said broken bottles
$mrs_corney$ said $mr_bumble$ stooping over the #matron# what is this ma am has #anything# happened ma am oh $mr_bumble$ cried the #lady# i have been so dreadfully put out
put out ma am exclaimed $mr_bumble$ who has dared to i know said $mr_bumble$ checking himself with native majesty this is them wicious paupers
it dreadful to think of said the #lady# shuddering then dont think of it ma am rejoined $mr_bumble$
i cant help it whimpered the #lady# then take #something# ma am said $mr_bumble$ soothingly a little of the wine not for the world replied $mrs_corney$
i couldnt oh the top shelf in the right #hand# #corner# oh uttering these #word# the good #lady# pointed distractedly to the cupboard and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms
$mr_bumble$ rushed to the closet and snatching a pint green glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated filled a tea cup with its contents and held it to the #lady# lips
$mr_bumble$ raised his #eye# piously to the ceiling in thankfulness and bringing them down again to the brim of the cup lifted it to his nose
i better now said $mrs_corney$ falling back after drinking half of it peppermint exclaimed $mrs_corney$ in a faint #voice# smiling gently on the #beadle# as she spoke
$mr_bumble$ tasted the medicine with a doubtful #look# smacked his lips took another taste and put the cup down empty
try it there a little a little #something# else in it it very comforting said $mrs_corney$ very much so indeed ma am said the #beadle#
as he spoke he drew a #chair# beside the #matron# and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her #nothing# replied $mrs_corney$
i am a foolish excitable weak creetur not weak ma am retorted $mr_bumble$ drawing his #chair# a little closer
are you a weak creetur $mrs_corney$ we are all weak creeturs said $mrs_corney$ laying down a general principle
by the expiration of that #time# $mr_bumble$ had illustrated the position by removing his left #arm# from the back of $mrs_corney$ #chair# where it had previously rested to $mrs_corney$ apron string round which it gradually became entwined
so we are said the #beadle# #nothing# was said on either #side# for a #minute# or two afterwards we are all weak creeturs said $mr_bumble$
$mrs_corney$ sighed dont sigh $mrs_corney$ said $mr_bumble$ i cant help it said $mrs_corney$ and she sighed again
this is a very comfortable #room# ma am said $mr_bumble$ looking round another #room# and this ma am would be a complete #thing#
it would be too much for #one# murmured the #lady# but not for two ma am rejoined $mr_bumble$ in soft accents
$mrs_corney$ drooped her #head# when the #beadle# said this the #beadle# drooped his to get a view of $mrs_corney$ #face#
$mrs_corney$ with great propriety turned her #head# away and released her #hand# to get at her #pocket# handkerchief but insensibly replaced it in that of $mr_bumble$
eh $mrs_corney$ the board allows you coals dont they $mrs_corney$ inquired the #beadle# affectionately pressing her #hand# and candles replied $mrs_corney$ slightly returning the pressure
coals candles and #house# rent free said $mr_bumble$ oh $mrs_corney$ what an angel you are the #lady# was not proof against this burst of feeling
she sank into $mr_bumble$ #arm# and that #gentleman# in his agitation imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose
such porochial perfection exclaimed $mr_bumble$ rapturously you know that mr slout is worse to #night# my fascinator yes replied $mrs_corney$ bashfully
he cant live a week the #doctor# says pursued $mr_bumble$ he is the #master# of this establishment his #death# will cause a wacancy that wacancy must be filled up
oh $mrs_corney$ what a prospect this opens what a opportunity for a jining of #heart# and housekeepings $mrs_corney$ sobbed
the little #word# said $mr_bumble$ bending over the bashful beauty the #one# little little little #word# my blessed $mrs_corney$
ye ye yes sighed out the #matron# #one# more pursued the #beadle# compose your darling feelings for only #one# more when is it to come off
at #length# summoning up courage she threw her #arm# around $mr_bumble$ neck and said it might be as soon as ever he pleased and that he was a irresistible duck
#matter# being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture which was rendered the more necessary by the flutter and agitation of the #lady# spirits
$mrs_corney$ twice essayed to speak and twice failed while it was being disposed of she acquainted $mr_bumble$ with the old #woman# decease
very good said that #gentleman# sipping his peppermint i ll call at $mr_sowerberry$ as i go home and tell him to send to morrow #morning#
was it that as frightened you love it wasnt #anything# particular #dear# said the #lady# evasively it must have been #something# love urged $mr_bumble$
wont you tell your own not now rejoined the #lady# #one# of these #day# after we re married #dear# after we re married exclaimed $mr_bumble$
if i #thought# it was continued $mr_bumble$ if i #thought# as any #one# of em had dared to lift his wulgar #eye# to that lovely countenance they wouldnt have dared to do it love responded the #lady#
it wasnt any impudence from any of them male paupers as no no love interposed the #lady# hastily they had better not said $mr_bumble$ clenching his fist
let me see any #man# porochial or extra porochial as would presume to do it and i can tell him that he wouldnt do it a second #time#
unembellished by any violence of gesticulation this might have seemed no very high compliment to the #lady# charms but as $mr_bumble$ accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures she was much touched with this proof of his devotion and protested with great admiration that he was indeed a dove
the dove then turned up his coat collar and put on his cocked #hat# and having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner once again braved the cold wind of the #night# merely pausing for a few #minute# in the male paupers ward to abuse them a little with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse #master# with needful acerbity
assured of his qualifications $mr_bumble$ left the building with a #light# #heart# and bright visions of his future promotion which served to occupy his #mind# until he reached the shop of the undertaker
now mr and mrs $mr_sowerberry$ having gone out to tea and supper and $mr_noah_claypole$ not being at any #time# disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking the shop was not closed although it was past the usual #hour# of shutting up
$mr_bumble$ tapped with his cane on the counter several #time# but attracting no attention and beholding a #light# shining through the glass #window# of the little parlour at the back of the shop he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward and when he saw what was going forward he was not a little surprised
the cloth was laid for supper the #table# was covered with bread and butter plates and glasses a porter pot and a wine bottle
at the upper end of the #table# $mr_noah_claypole$ lolled negligently in an easy #chair# with his legs thrown over #one# of the #arm# an open clasp knife in #one# #hand# and a mass of buttered bread in the other
a more than ordinary redness in the region of the young #gentleman# nose and a kind of fixed wink in his right #eye# denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters for which #nothing# but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties in cases of internal fever could have sufficiently accounted
close beside him stood $charlotte$ opening oysters from a barrel which $mr_noah_claypole$ condescended to swallow with remarkable avidity here a delicious fat #one# $mr_noah_claypole$ #dear# said $charlotte$ try him do only this #one#
what a delicious #thing# is a oyster remarked $mr_noah_claypole$ after he had swallowed it what a pity it is a number of em should ever make you feel uncomfortable isnt it $charlotte$
it quite a cruelty said $charlotte$ so it is acquiesced $mr_noah_claypole$ ant yer fond of oysters not overmuch replied $charlotte$
i like to see you eat em $mr_noah_claypole$ #dear# better than eating em myself lor said $mr_noah_claypole$ reflectively how queer have another said $charlotte$
here #one# with such a beautiful delicate beard i cant manage any more said $mr_noah_claypole$ i very sorry come here $charlotte$ and i ll kiss yer
what said $mr_bumble$ bursting into the #room# say that again #sir# $charlotte$ uttered a scream and hid her #face# in her apron
$mr_noah_claypole$ without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the #ground# gazed at the #beadle# in drunken terror say it again you wile owdacious fellow said $mr_bumble$
how dare you mention such a #thing# #sir# and how dare you encourage him you insolent minx kiss her exclaimed $mr_bumble$ in strong indignation
faugh i didnt mean to do it said $mr_noah_claypole$ blubbering she always a kissing of me whether i like it or not
she always a doin of it $mr_bumble$ #sir# she chucks me under the chin please #sir# and makes all #manner# of love
oh $mr_noah_claypole$ cried $charlotte$ reproachfully yer are yer know yer are retorted $mr_noah_claypole$ #silence# cried $mr_bumble$ sternly
$mr_noah_claypole$ you shut up the shop say another #word# till your #master# comes home at your peril and when he does come home tell him that $mr_bumble$ said he was to send a old #woman# shell after breakfast to morrow #morning#
take yourself downstairs ma am do you hear #sir# kissing cried $mr_bumble$ holding up his #hand# the sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful
if parliament dont take their abominable courses under consideration this country ruined and the character of the peasantry gone for ever
and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home and have made all necessary preparations for the old #woman# funeral let us set on #foot# a few inquires after young $oliver_twist$ and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where $mr_toby_crackit$ left him
with these #word# the #beadle# strode with a lofty and gloomy #air# from the undertaker premises #chapter# xxviii #look# after $oliver_twist$ and proceeds with his adventures
wolves #tear# your throats muttered $mr_william_sikes$ grinding his teeth i wish i was among some of you you howl the hoarser for it
as $mr_william_sikes$ growled forth this imprecation with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of he rested the body of the wounded #boy# across his bended knee and turned his #head# for an instant to #look# back at his pursuers
there was little to be made out in the mist and darkness but the loud shouting of #man# vibrated through the #air# and the barking of the neighbouring #dog# roused by the sound of the alarm bell resounded in every direction
stop you white livered hound cried the robber shouting after $mr_toby_crackit$ who making the best use of his long legs was already ahead
for he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol shot and $mr_william_sikes$ was in no mood to be played with
stop the repetition of the #word# brought $mr_toby_crackit$ to a dead stand still bear a #hand# with the #boy# cried $mr_william_sikes$ beckoning furiously to his confederate come back
$mr_toby_crackit$ made a show of returning but ventured in a low #voice# broken for want of breath to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along
quicker cried $mr_william_sikes$ laying the #boy# in a dry ditch at his #foot# and drawing a pistol from his #pocket#
$mr_william_sikes$ again looking round could discern that the #man# who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood and that a couple of #dog# were some paces in advance of them
dont play booty with me at this #moment# the noise grew louder it all up $bill_sikes$ cried $mr_toby_crackit$ drop the kid and show em your heels
with this parting advice $mr_toby_crackit$ preferring the chance of being shot by his #friend# to the certainty of being taken by his enemies fairly turned tail and darted off at full speed
$mr_william_sikes$ clenched his teeth took #one# #look# around threw over the prostrate form of $oliver_twist$ the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ran along the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those behind from the spot where the #boy# lay paused for a second before another hedge which met it at right angles and whirling his pistol high into the #air# cleared it at a bound and was gone
the #dog# who in common with their #master# seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged readily answered to the command
ho ho there cried a tremulous #voice# in the rear pincher neptune come here come here three #man# who had by this #time# advanced some distance into the field stopped to take counsel together
my advice or leastways i should say my orders is said the fattest #man# of the party that we mediately go home again
i am agreeable to #anything# which is agreeable to $mr_giles$ said a shorter #man# who was by no means of a slim figure and who was very pale in the #face# and very polite as frightened #man# frequently are
i shouldnt wish to appear ill mannered #gentleman# said the third who had called the #dog# back $mr_giles$ ought to know
certainly replied the shorter #man# and whatever $mr_giles$ says it isnt our #place# to contradict him no no i know my sitiwation
to tell the truth the little #man# did seem to know his situation and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable #one# for his teeth chattered in his #head# as he spoke
thank my stars i know my sitiwation you are afraid brittles said $mr_giles$ i ant said brittles you are said $mr_giles$
now these four retorts arose from $mr_giles$ taunt and $mr_giles$ taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment
you re a falsehood $mr_giles$ said brittles you re a lie brittles said $mr_giles$ the third #man# brought the dispute to a close most philosophically
i ll tell you what it is #gentleman# said he we re all afraid speak for yourself #sir# said $mr_giles$ who was the palest of the party
so i do replied the #man# it natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances i am so am i said brittles only there no call to tell a #man# he is so bounceably
these frank admissions softened $mr_giles$ who at once owned that he was afraid upon which they all three faced about and ran back again with the completest unanimity until $mr_giles$ who had the shortest wind of the party as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely insisted on stopping to make an apology for his hastiness of speech
but it wonderful said $mr_giles$ when he had explained what a #man# will do when his blood is up i should have committed murder
as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment and as their blood like his had all gone down again some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament
i know i should if we caught #one# of them rascals i know what it was said $mr_giles$ it was the gate
i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittles catching at the idea you may depend upon it said $mr_giles$ that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement
i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was climbing over it by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise #moment#
it was quite obvious therefore that it was the gate especially as there was no doubt regarding the #time# at which the change had taken #place# because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance
this dialogue was held between the two #man# who had surprised the burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in the pursuit
$mr_giles$ acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old #lady# of the mansion brittles was a lad of all work who having entered her service a mere #child# was treated as a promising young #boy# still though he was #something# past thirty
encouraging each other with such converse as this but keeping very close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs the three #man# hurried back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern lest its #light# should inform the thieves in what direction to #fire#
catching up the #light# they made the best of their #way# home at a good round trot and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible the #light# might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne
the #air# grew colder as #day# came slowly on and the mist rolled along the #ground# like a dense cloud of smoke
the grass was wet the pathways and low #place# were all mire and #water# the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning
the #air# become more sharp and piercing as its first dull hue the #death# of #night# rather than the birth of #day# glimmered faintly in the sky
the objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes
still $oliver_twist$ lay motionless and insensible on the spot where $mr_william_sikes$ had left him #morning# drew on apace the rain came down thick and fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes
but $oliver_twist$ felt it not as it beat against him for he still lay stretched helpless and unconscious on his #bed# of clay
his left #arm# rudely bandaged in a shawl hung heavy and useless at his #side# the bandage was saturated with blood
he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture when he had done so he looked feebly round for help and groaned with pain
trembling in every joint from cold and exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright but shuddering from #head# to #foot# fell prostrate on the #ground#
after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged $oliver_twist$ urged by a creeping sickness at his #heart# which seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die got upon his #foot# and essayed to walk
at #length# a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed and uttering it the #boy# awoke his #head# was dizzy and he staggered to and fro like a drunken #man#
but he kept up nevertheless and with his #head# drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he knew not whither
he seemed to be still walking between $mr_william_sikes$ and $mr_toby_crackit$ who were angrily disputing for the very #word# they said sounded in his ears and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was talking to them
then he was alone with $mr_william_sikes$ plodding on as on the previous #day# and as shadowy #people# passed them he felt the robber grasp upon his wrist
suddenly he started back at the report of firearms there $miss_rose$ into the #air# loud cries and shouts #light# gleamed before his #eye# all was noise and tumult as some unseen #hand# bore him hurriedly away
and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his #mind# through all these rapid visions there ran an undefined uneasy consciousness of pain which wearied and tormented him incessantly
thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars of gates or through hedge gaps as they came in his #way# until he reached a road
here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused him he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a #house# which perhaps he could reach
pitying his condition they might have compassion on him and if they did not it would be better he #thought# to die near human beings than in the lonely open fields
he summoned up all his strength for #one# last trial and bent his faltering steps towards it as he drew nearer to this #house# a feeling come over him that he had seen it before
he remembered #nothing# of its details but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him that garden wall
on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last #night# and prayed the two #man# mercy it was the very #house# they had attempted to rob
when he recognised the #place# that for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and #thought# only of flight
he could scarcely stand and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame whither could he fly
$oliver_twist$ felt such fear come over him flight he pushed against the garden gate it was unlocked and swung open on its hinges
he tottered across the lawn climbed the steps knocked faintly at the #door# and his whole strength failing him sunk down against #one# of the pillars of the little portico
it happened that about this #time# $mr_giles$ brittles and the tinker were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the #night# with tea and sundries in the kitchen
not that it was $mr_giles$ habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society
but #death# #fire# and burglary make all #man# equals so $mr_giles$ sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender leaning his left #arm# on the #table# while with his right he illustrated a circumstantial and #minute# account of the robbery to which his bearers but especially the cook and housemaid who were of the party listened with breathless interest
it was about half past two said $mr_giles$ or i wouldnt swear that it mightnt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my #bed# as it might be so
here $mr_giles$ turned round in his #chair# and pulled the #corner# of the #table# cloth over him to imitate #bed# clothes i fancied i heerd a noise
at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the housemaid to shut the #door# who asked brittles who asked the tinker who pretended not to hear heerd
i says at first this is illusion and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the noise again distinct
a noise continued $mr_giles$ what sort of a noise asked the cook a kind of a busting noise replied $mr_giles$ looking round him
more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater suggested brittles it was when you heerd it #sir# rejoined $mr_giles$ but at this #time# it had a busting sound
i turned down the clothes continued $mr_giles$ rolling back the #table# cloth sat up in #bed# and listened the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated lor and drew their #chair# closer together
i heerd it now quite apparent resumed $mr_giles$ somebody i says is forcing of a #door# or #window# what to be done
i ll call up that poor lad brittles and save him from being murdered in his #bed# or his throat i says may be cut from his right ear to his left without his ever knowing it
here all #eye# were turned upon brittles who fixed his upon the speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his #face# expressive of the most unmitigated horror
i tossed off the clothes said $mr_giles$ throwing away the #table# cloth and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid got softly out of #bed# drew on a pair of
shoes #sir# said $mr_giles$ turning upon him and laying great emphasis on the #word# seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket and walked on tiptoes to his #room#
#lady# present $mr_giles$ murmured the tinker of brittles i says when i had woke him dont be frightened
we re dead #man# i think brittles i says continued $mr_giles$ but dont be frightened was he frightened asked the cook
so you did observed brittles in a low #voice# not a bit of it replied $mr_giles$ he was as firm ah
pretty near as firm as i was i should have died at once i sure if it had been me observed the housemaid
you re a #woman# retorted brittles plucking up a little brittles is right said $mr_giles$ nodding his #head# approvingly from a #woman# #nothing# else was to be expected
we being #man# took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle hob and groped our #way# downstairs in the pitch
$mr_giles$ had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his #eye# shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried back to his #chair#
dark as it might be so the cook and housemaid screamed it was a knock said $mr_giles$ assuming perfect serenity
it seems a strange sort of a #thing# a knock coming at such a #time# in the #morning# said $mr_giles$ surveying the pale #face# which surrounded him and looking very blank himself but the #door# must be opened
$mr_giles$ as he spoke looked at brittles but that young #man# being naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him at all events he tendered no reply
open the #door# somebody nobody moved do you hear somebody $mr_giles$ directed an appealing glance at the tinker but he had suddenly fallen asleep
if brittles would rather open the #door# in the presence of witnesses said $mr_giles$ after a short #silence# i am ready to make #one#
the #woman# were out of the question so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly as he had fallen asleep
brittles capitulated on these terms and the party being somewhat re assured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that it was now broad #day# took their #way# upstairs with the #dog# in front
by the advice of $mr_giles$ they all talked very loud to warn any evil disposed #person# outside that they were strong in numbers and by a #master# stoke of policy originating in the brain of the same ingenious #gentleman# the #dog# tails were well pinched in the hall to make them bark savagely
these precautions having been taken $mr_giles$ held on fast by the tinker #arm# to prevent his running away as he pleasantly said and gave the #word# of command to open the #door#
brittles obeyed the group peeping timorously over each other shoulders beheld no more formidable object than poor little $oliver_twist$ speechless and exhausted who raised his heavy #eye# and mutely solicited their compassion
the two #woman# who were afraid to stay below brought up the rear a #boy# exclaimed $mr_giles$ valiantly pushing the tinker into the background
what the #matter# with the eh why brittles #look# here dont you know brittles who had got behind the #door# to open it no sooner saw $oliver_twist$ than he uttered a loud cry
$mr_giles$ seizing the #boy# by #one# leg and #one# #arm# fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the hall and deposited him at full #length# on the floor thereof
here he is bawled $mr_giles$ calling in a state of great excitement up the staircase here #one# of the thieves ma am
in a lantern miss cried brittles applying #one# #hand# to the #side# of his mouth so that his #voice# might travel the better
the two #woman# servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that $mr_giles$ had captured a robber and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore $oliver_twist$ lest he should die before he could be hanged
in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard a sweet female #voice# which quelled it in an instant
here a thief miss wounded miss i shot him miss and brittles held the #light# $mr_giles$ whispered the #voice# from the stair #head#
i here miss replied $mr_giles$ dont be frightened miss i aint much injured he didnt make a very desperate resistance miss
i was soon too many for him hush replied the young #lady# you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did
is the poor creature much hurt wounded desperate miss replied $mr_giles$ with indescribable complacency he #look# as if he was a going miss bawled brittles in the same #manner# as before
wouldnt you like to come and #look# at him miss in case he should hush pray there a good #man# rejoined the #lady#
wait quietly only #one# instant while i speak to aunt with a footstep as soft and gentle as the #voice# the speaker tripped away
she soon returned with the direction that the wounded #person# was to be carried carefully upstairs to $mr_giles$ #room# and that brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to chertsey from which #place# he was to despatch with all speed a constable and #doctor#
but wont you take #one# #look# at him first miss asked $mr_giles$ with as much pride as if $oliver_twist$ were some bird of rare plumage that he had skilfully brought down
not #one# little peep miss not now for the world replied the young #lady# poor fellow oh treat him kindly $mr_giles$ for my sake
the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own #child#
then bending over $oliver_twist$ he helped to carry him upstairs with the care and solicitude of a #woman# #chapter# xxix has an introductory account of the inmates of the #house# to which $oliver_twist$
in a handsome #room# though its furniture had rather the #air# of old fashioned comfort than of modern elegance there sat two #lady# at a well spread breakfast #table#
he had taken his station some half #way# between the #side# board and the breakfast #table# and with his body drawn up to its full height his #head# thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on #one# #side# his left leg advanced and his right #hand# thrust into his waist coat while his left hung down by his #side# grasping a waiter looked like #one# who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance
of the two #lady# #one# was well advanced in #year# but the high backed oaken #chair# in which she sat was not more upright than she
dressed with the utmost nicety and precision in a quaint mixture of by gone costume with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect she sat in a stately #manner# with her #hand# folded on the #table# before her
resorted $mr_giles$ dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them her #eye# and age had dimmed but little of their brightness were attentively upon her young #companion#
the younger #lady# was in the lovely bloom and spring #time# of womanhood at that age when if ever angels be for god good purposes enthroned in mortal forms they may be without impiety supposed to abide in such as hers
cast in so slight and exquisite a mould so mild and gentle so pure and beautiful that earth seemed not her element nor its rough creatures her fit #companion#
the very intelligence that shone in her deep blue #eye# and was stamped upon her noble #head# seemed scarcely of her age or of the world and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour the thousand #light# that played about the #face# and left no shadow there above all the smile the cheerful happy smile were made for home and fireside peace and happiness
chancing to raise her #eye# as the elder #lady# was regarding her she playfully put back her hair which was simply braided on her forehead and threw into her beaming #look# such an expression of affection and artless loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to #look# upon her
she was not past seventeen she was busily engaged in the little offices of the #table# and brittles has been gone upwards of an #hour# has he asked the old #lady# after a pause
an #hour# and twelve #minute# ma am replied $mr_giles$ referring to a silver watch which he drew forth by a black ribbon
and seeing by the bye that brittles had been a slow #boy# for upwards of thirty #year# there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast #one#
he is always slow remarked the old #lady# brittles always was a slow #boy# ma am replied the attendant he gets worse instead of better i think said the elder #lady#
$mr_giles$ was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself when a gig drove up to the garden gate out of which there jumped a fat #gentleman# who ran straight up to the #door# and who getting quickly into the #house# by some mysterious process burst into the #room# and nearly overturned $mr_giles$ and the breakfast #table# together
it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other #boy# said the young #lady# smiling i never heard of such a #thing# exclaimed the fat #gentleman#
with these expressions of condolence the fat #gentleman# shook #hand# with both #lady# and drawing up a #chair# inquired how they found themselves
my #dear# $mrs_maylie$ bless my soul in the #silence# of the #night# too i never heard of such a #thing# you ought to be dead positively dead with the fright said the fat #gentleman#
bless me my #man# should have come in a #minute# and so would i and my assistant would have been delighted or anybody i sure under such circumstances
the #doctor# seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected and attempted in the #night# #time# as if it were the established custom of #gentleman# in the housebreaking #way# to transact business at noon and to make an appointment by post a #day# or two previous
and you $miss_rose$ said the #doctor# turning to the young #lady# i oh very much so indeed said $miss_rose$ interrupting him but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see
why didnt you send #dear# dear so unexpected in the #silence# of the #night# too ah to be sure replied the #doctor# so there is
$mr_giles$ who had been feverishly putting the tea cups to rights blushed very red and said that he had had that honour
honour eh said the #doctor# well i dont know perhaps it as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your #man# at twelve paces
$mr_giles$ who #thought# this #light# treatment of the #matter# an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory answered respectfully that it was not for the like of him to judge about that but he rather #thought# it was no joke to the opposite party
that was your handiwork $mr_giles$ i understand fancy that he fired in the #air# and you ve fought a duel $mr_giles$ gad that true said the #doctor#
where is he show me the #way# i ll #look# in again as i come down $mrs_maylie$ that the little #window# that he got in at eh
talking all the #way# he followed $mr_giles$ upstairs and while he is going upstairs the reader may be informed that $mr_losberne$ a surgeon in the neighbourhood known through a circuit of ten miles round as the #doctor# had grown fat more from good humour than from good living and was as kind and hearty and withal as eccentric an old bachelor as will be found in five #time# that space by any explorer alive
a large flat box was fetched out of the gig and a bedroom bell was rung very often and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually from which tokens it was justly concluded that #something# important was going on above
at #length# he returned and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient looked very mysterious and closed the #door# carefully
this is a very extraordinary #thing# $mrs_maylie$ said the #doctor# standing with his back to the #door# as if to keep it shut
well i couldnt have believed it the #doctor# was absent much longer than either he or the #lady# had anticipated he is not in danger i hope said the old #lady#
why that would not be an extraordinary #thing# under the circumstances replied the #doctor# though i dont think he is have you seen the thief
i beg your pardon ma am interposed $mr_giles$ but i was going to tell you about him when #doctor# $mr_losberne$ came in
the fact was that $mr_giles$ had not at first been able to bring his #mind# to the avowal that he had only shot a #boy#
such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery that he could not for the #life# of him help postponing the explanation for a few delicious #minute# during which he had flourished in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage
no rejoined the old #lady# nor heard #anything# about him no $miss_rose$ wished to see the #man# said $mrs_maylie$ but i wouldnt hear of it
humph rejoined the #doctor# there is #nothing# very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence
then i think it is necessary said the #doctor# at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it
if it be necessary replied the old #lady# certainly not he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow me $miss_rose$ will you permit me
with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal the #doctor# drew the young #lady# #arm# through #one# of his and offering his disengaged #hand# to $mrs_maylie$ led them with much ceremony and stateliness upstairs
now said the #doctor# in a whisper as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom #door# let us hear what you think of him
not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour #chapter# xxx relates what $oliver_twist$ new visitors #thought# of him he has not been shaved very recently but he dont #look# at all ferocious notwithstanding
motioning them to advance he closed the #door# when they had entered and gently drew back the curtains of the #bed#
upon it in lieu of the dogged black visaged ruffian they had expected to behold there lay a mere #child# worn with pain and exhaustion and sunk into a deep sleep
his wounded #arm# bound and splintered up was crossed upon his breast his #head# reclined upon the other #arm# which was half hidden by his long hair as it streamed over the pillow
stop though let me first see that he is in visiting order stepping before them he looked into the #room# the honest #gentleman# held the curtain in his #hand# and looked on for a #minute# or so in #silence#
whilst he was watching the patient thus the younger #lady# glided softly past and seating herself in a #chair# by the bedside gathered $oliver_twist$ hair from his #face#
the #boy# stirred and smiled in his sleep as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known
thus a strain of gentle music or the rippling of #water# in a silent #place# or the odour of a flower or the mention of a familiar #word# will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were in this #life# which vanish like a breath which some brief memory of a happier existence long gone by would seem to have awakened which no voluntary exertion of the #mind# can ever recall
as she stooped over him her #tear# fell upon his forehead what can this mean exclaimed the elder #lady# this poor #child# can never have been the pupil of robbers
vice said the surgeon replacing the curtain takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her
my #dear# young #lady# rejoined the surgeon mournfully shaking his #head# crime like #death# is not confined to the old and withered alone
but at so early an age urged $miss_rose$ the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims
but can you oh can you really believe that this delicate #boy# has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society said $miss_rose$
the surgeon shook his #head# in a #manner# which intimated that he feared it was very possible and observing that they might disturb the patient led the #way# into an adjoining apartment
but even if he has been wicked pursued $miss_rose$ think how young he is think that he may never have known a #mother# love or the comfort of a home that ill usage and blows or the want of bread may have driven him to herd with #man# who have forced him to guilt
aunt #dear# aunt for mercy sake think of this before you let them drag this sick #child# to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment
as you love me and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor #child# have pity upon him before it is too late
my #dear# love said the elder #lady# as she folded the weeping #girl# to her bosom do you think i would harm a hair of his #head#
no surely said the old #lady# my #day# are drawing to their close and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others
oh oh no replied $miss_rose$ eagerly what can i do to save him #sir# let me think ma am said the #doctor# let me think
$mr_losberne$ thrust his #hand# into his #pocket# and took several turns up and down the #room# often stopping and balancing himself on his toes and frowning frightfully
after various exclamations of i ve got it now and no i havent and as many renewals of the walking and frowning he at #length# made a dead halt and spoke as follows
i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully $mr_giles$ and that little #boy# brittles i can manage it
$mr_giles$ is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand #way# and reward him for being such a good shot besides
you dont object to that unless there is some other #way# of preserving the #child# replied $mrs_maylie$ there is no other said the #doctor#
then my aunt invests you with full power said $miss_rose$ smiling through her #tear# but pray dont be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary
no other take my #word# for it you seem to think retorted the #doctor# that everybody is disposed to be hard hearted to #day# except yourself $miss_rose$
i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present
you are as great a #boy# as poor brittles himself returned $miss_rose$ blushing well said the #doctor# laughing heartily that is no very difficult #matter#
but to return to this #boy# the great point of our agreement is yet to come he will wake in an #hour# or so
i dare say and although i have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musnt be moved or spoken to on peril of his #life# i think we may converse with him without danger
now i make this stipulation that i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad #one# which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any farther interference on my #part# at all events
oh no aunt entreated $miss_rose$ oh yes aunt said the #doctor# is is a bargain he cannot be hardened in vice said $miss_rose$ it is impossible
finally the treaty was entered into and the parties thereunto sat down to wait with some impatience until $oliver_twist$ should awake
the patience of the two #lady# was destined to undergo a longer trial than $mr_losberne$ had led them to expect for #hour# after #hour# passed on and still $oliver_twist$ slumbered heavily
it was evening indeed before the kind hearted #doctor# brought them the intelligence that he was at #length# sufficiently restored to be spoken to
the #boy# was very ill he said and weak from the loss of blood but his #mind# was so troubled with anxiety to disclose #something# that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next #morning# which he should otherwise have done
very good retorted the #doctor# then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition the conference was a long #one#
it was a solemn #thing# to hear in the darkened #room# the feeble #voice# of the sick #child# recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard #man# had brought upon him
oh if when we oppress and grind our fellow creatures we bestowed but #one# #thought# on the dark evidences of human error which like dense and heavy clouds are rising slowly it is true but not less surely to heaven to pour their after vengeance on our #head# if we heard but #one# instant in imagination the deep testimony of dead #man# #voice# which no power can stifle and no pride shut out where would be the injury and injustice the suffering misery cruelty and wrong that each #day# #life# brings with it
$oliver_twist$ told them all his simple history and was often compelled to stop by pain and want of strength $oliver_twist$ pillow was smoothed by gentle #hand# that #night# and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept
the momentous interview was no sooner concluded and $oliver_twist$ composed to rest again than the #doctor# after wiping his #eye# and condemning them for being weak all at once betook himself downstairs to open upon $mr_giles$
and finding nobody about the parlours it occurred to him that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen so into the kitchen he went
there were assembled in that lower #house# of the domestic parliament the #woman# servants mr brittles $mr_giles$ the tinker who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the #day# in consideration of his services and the constable
the latter #gentleman# had a large staff a large #head# large features and large half boots and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale as indeed he had
the adventures of the previous #night# were still under discussion for $mr_giles$ was expatiating upon his presence of #mind# when the #doctor# entered mr brittles with a mug of ale in his #hand# was corroborating everything before his superior said it
he felt calm and happy and could have died without a murmur sit still said the #doctor# waving his #hand#
misses wished some ale to be given out #sir# and as i felt no #way# inclined for my own little #room# #sir# and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here
brittles headed a low murmur by which the #lady# and #gentleman# generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from $mr_giles$ condescension
$mr_giles$ looked round with a patronising #air# as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly he would never desert them
thank you #sir# said $mr_giles$ how is the patient to #night# #sir# asked $mr_giles$ so so returned the #doctor#
i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there $mr_giles$ i hope you dont mean to say #sir# said $mr_giles$ trembling that he going to die
if i #thought# it i should never be happy again i wouldnt cut a #boy# off no not even brittles here not for all the plate in the county #sir#
that not the point said the #doctor# mysteriously $mr_giles$ are you a protestant yes #sir# i hope so faltered $mr_giles$ who had turned very pale
and what are you #boy# said the #doctor# turning sharply upon brittles lord bless me #sir# replied brittles starting violently i the same as $mr_giles$ #sir#
are you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that #boy# upstairs is the #boy# that was put through the little #window# last #night#
then tell me this said the #doctor# both of you both of you out with it come we are prepared for you
the #doctor# who was universally considered #one# of the best tempered creatures on earth made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger that $mr_giles$ and brittles who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement stared at each other in a state of stupefaction
said the #doctor# shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of #manner# and tapping the bridge of his nose with it to bespeak the exercise of that worthy utmost acuteness
the constable looked as wise as he could and took up his staff of office which had been reclining indolently in the chimney #corner#
pay attention to the reply constable will you #something# may come of this before long it a simple question of identity you will observe said the #doctor#
that what it is #sir# replied the constable coughing with great violence for he had finished his ale in a hurry and some of it had gone the wrong #way#
here the #house# broken into said the #doctor# and a couple of #man# catch #one# #moment# glimpse of a #boy# in the midst of gunpowder smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness
a #boy# comes to that very same #house# next #morning# and because he happens to have his #arm# tied up these #man# lay violent #hand# upon him by doing which they #place# his #life# in great danger and swear he is the thief
now the question is whether these #man# are justified by the fact if not in what situation do they #place# themselves
here the constable nodded profoundly he said if that wasnt law he would be glad to know what was i ask you again thundered the #doctor# are you on your solemn oaths able to identify that #boy#
brittles looked doubtfully at $mr_giles$ mr $mr_giles$ looked doubtfully at brittles the constable put his #hand# behind his ear to catch the reply the two #woman# and the tinker leaned forward to listen the #doctor# glanced keenly round when a ring was heard at the gate and at the same #moment# the sound of wheels
it the runners cried brittles to all appearance much relieved the what exclaimed the #doctor# aghast in his turn
the bow #street# officers #sir# replied brittles taking up a candle me and $mr_giles$ sent for em this #morning#
yes replied brittles i sent a message up by the coachman and i only wonder they werent here before #sir#
what cried the #doctor# you did did you then confound your slow coaches down here that all said the #doctor# walking away
inquired brittles opening the #door# a little #way# with the chain up and peeping out shading the candle with his #hand#
#chapter# xxxi involves a critical position who that open the #door# replied a #man# outside it the officers from bow #street# as was sent to to #day#
much comforted by this assurance brittles opened the #door# to its full width and confronted a portly #man# in a great coat who walked in without saying #anything# more and wiped his shoes on the mat as coolly as if he lived there
just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young #man# said the officer he in the gig a minding the prad
brittles replying in the affirmative and pointing out the building the portly #man# stepped back to the garden gate and helped his #companion# to put up the gig while brittles lighted them in a state of great admiration
this done they returned to the #house# and being shown into a parlour took off their great coats and #hat# and showed like what they were
the #man# who had knocked at the #door# was a stout personage of middle height aged about fifty with shiny black hair cropped pretty close half whiskers a round #face# and sharp #eye#
have you got a coach us here that you could put it up in for five or ten #minute# the other was a red headed bony #man# in top boots with a rather ill favoured countenance and a turned up sinister looking nose
tell your governor that blathers and $duff$ is here will you said the stouter #man# smoothing down his hair and laying a pair of handcuffs on the #table#
this was addressed to $mr_losberne$ who now made his appearance that #gentleman# motioning brittles to retire brought in the two #lady# and shut the #door#
oh good evening #master# can i have a #word# or two with you in private if you please this is the #lady# of the #house# said $mr_losberne$ motioning towards $mrs_maylie$
being desired to sit down he put his #hat# on the floor and taking a #chair# motioned to $duff$ to do the same
the latter #gentleman# who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society or quite so much at his ease in it #one# of the two seated himself after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs and the #head# of his stick into his mouth with some embarrassment
mr blathers made a bow now with regard to this here robbery #master# said blathers what are the circumstances $mr_losberne$ who appeared desirous of gaining #time# recounted them at great #length# and with much circumlocution
i cant say for certain till i see the work of course said blathers but my opinion at once is i dont #mind# committing myself to that
messrs blathers and $duff$ looked very knowing meanwhile and occasionally exchanged a nod extent that this wasnt done by a yokel eh $duff$
and translating the #word# yokel for the benefit of the #lady# i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman said $mr_losberne$ with a smile
certainly not replied $duff$ that it #master# replied blathers this is all about the robbery is it all replied the #doctor#
now what is this about this here #boy# that the servants are a talking on said blathers #nothing# at all replied the #doctor#
#one# of the frightened servants chose to take it into his #head# that he had #something# to do with this attempt to break into the #house# but it nonsense sheer absurdity
what he says is quite correct observed blathers nodding his #head# in a confirmatory #way# and playing carelessly with the handcuffs as if they were a pair of castanets
wery easy disposed of if it is remarked $duff$ who is the #boy# what account does he give of himself
where did he come from he didnt drop out of the clouds did he #master# of course not replied the #doctor# with a nervous glance at the two #lady#
i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently you would like first to see the #place# where the thieves made their attempt i suppose
certainly rejoined mr blathers we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards that the usual #way# of doing business
#light# were then procured and messrs blathers and $duff$ attended by the native constable brittles $mr_giles$ and everybody else in short went into the little #room# at the end of the passage and looked out at the #window# and afterwards went round by #way# of the lawn and looked in at the #window# and after that had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with and after that a lantern to trace the footsteps with and after that a pitchfork to poke the bushes with
this done amidst the breathless interest of all beholders they came in again and $mr_giles$ and brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous #night# adventures which they performed some six #time# over contradicting each other in not more than #one# important respect the first #time# and in not more than a dozen the last
this consummation being arrived at blathers and $duff$ cleared the #room# and held a long council together compared with which for secrecy and solemnity a consultation of great #doctor# on the knottiest point in medicine would be mere #child# play
meanwhile the #doctor# walked up and down the next #room# in a very uneasy state and $mrs_maylie$ and $miss_rose$ looked on with anxious #face#
upon my #word# he said making a halt after a great number of very rapid turns i hardly know what to do
surely said $miss_rose$ the poor #child# story faithfully repeated to these #man# will be sufficient to exonerate him i doubt it my #dear# young #lady# said the #doctor# shaking his #head#
i dont think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade what is he after all they would say
a runaway judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful #one# you believe it surely interrupted $miss_rose$
i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so rejoined the #doctor# but i dont think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer nevertheless
because viewed with their #eye# there are many ugly points about it he can only prove the #part# that #look# ill and none of those that #look# well
why not demanded $miss_rose$ because my pretty cross examiner replied the #doctor# confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and will take #nothing# for granted
on his own showing you see he has been the #companion# of thieves for some #time# past he has been carried to a police officer on a charge of picking a #gentleman# #pocket# he has been taken away forcibly from that #gentleman# #house# to a #place# which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea
he is brought down to chertsey by #man# who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and is put through a #window# to rob a #house# and then just at the very #moment# when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very #thing# that would set him all to rights there rushes into the #way# a blundering #dog# of a half bred butler and shoots him
i see it of course replied $miss_rose$ smiling at the #doctor# impetuosity but still i do not see #anything# in it to criminate the poor #child#
as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself dont you see all this no replied the #doctor# of course not
they never see whether for good or bad more than #one# #side# of any question and that is always the #one# which first presents itself to them
having given vent to this result of experience the #doctor# put his #hand# into his #pocket# and walked up and down the #room# with even greater rapidity than before
the more i think of it said the #doctor# the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these #man# in possession of the #boy# real story
i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do #nothing# to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery
bless the bright #eye# of your sex oh what is to be done cried $miss_rose$ #dear# dear why did they send for these #people#
all i know is said $mr_losberne$ at last sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness that we must try and carry it off with a bold #face#
why indeed exclaimed $mrs_maylie$ i would not have had them here for the world the object is a good #one# and that must be our excuse
the #boy# has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be talked to any more that #one# comfort
we must make the best of it and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours come in
well #master# said blathers entering the #room# followed by his colleague and making the #door# fast before he said any more
we call it a put up robbery #lady# said blathers turning to them as if he pitied their ignorance but had a contempt for the #doctor# when the servants is in it
this warnt a put up #thing# and what the devil a put up #thing# demanded the #doctor# impatiently nobody suspected them in this case said $mrs_maylie$
wery likely not ma am replied blathers but they might have been in it for all that more likely on that wery account said $duff$
we find it was a town #hand# said blathers continuing his report for the style of work is first rate wery pretty indeed it is remarked
there was two of em in it continued blathers and they had a #boy# with em that plain from the size of the #window#
we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once if you please perhaps they will take #something# to drink first $mrs_maylie$ said the #doctor# his #face# brightening as if some new #thought# had occurred to him
$duff$ in an undertone that all to be said at present oh to be sure exclaimed $miss_rose$ eagerly you shall have it immediately if you will
that handy miss dont put yourself out of the #way# on our accounts what shall it be asked the #doctor# following the young #lady# to the sideboard
why thank you miss said blathers drawing his coat sleeve across his mouth it dry work this sort of duty anythink a little drop of spirits #master# if it all the same replied blathers
it a cold ride from london ma am and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings this interesting communication was addressed to $mrs_maylie$ who received it very graciously
ah said mr blathers not holding his wine glass by the stem but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left #hand# and placing it in front of his chest i have seen a good many pieces of business like this in my #time# #lady#
while it was being conveyed to her the #doctor# slipped out of the #room# that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers said mr $duff$ assisting his colleague memory
that was #something# in this #way# warnt it rejoined mr blathers that was done by conkey chickweed that was you always gave that to him replied $duff$
it was the family pet i tell you conkey hadnt any more to do with it than i had get out retorted mr blathers i know better
do you #mind# that #time# when conkey was robbed of his money though what a start that was better than any novel #book# i ever see
what was that inquired $miss_rose$ anxious to encourage any symptoms of good humour in the unwelcome visitors it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down upon said blathers
this here conkey chickweed conkey means nosey ma am interposed $duff$ of course the #lady# knows that dont she demanded mr blathers
this here conkey chickweed miss kept a public #house# over battlebridge #way# and he had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cock fighting and badger drawing and that and a wery intellectual #manner# the sports was conducted in for i ve seen em off en
he warnt #one# of the family at that #time# and #one# #night# he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of #night# by a tall #man# with a black patch over his #eye# who had concealed himself under the #bed# and after committing the robbery jumped slap out of #window# which was only a story high
always interrupting you are partner he was wery quick about it but conkey was quick too for he fired a blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood
they set up a hue and cry directly and when they came to #look# about em found that conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the #way# to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em
however he had made off with the blunt and consequently the #name# of mr chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts and all #manner# of benefits and subscriptions and i dont know what all was got up for the poor #man# who was in a wery low state of #mind# about his loss and went up and down the #street# for three or four #day# a pulling his hair off in such a desperate #manner# that many #people# was afraid he might be going to make away with himself
#one# #day# he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the #man# as robbed his #house#
i see him spyers said chickweed pass my #house# yesterday #morning# why didnt you up and collar him says spyers
i was so struck all of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick says the poor #man#
spyers no sooner heard this than he put some clean linen and a comb in his #pocket# in case he should have to stop a #day# or two and away he goes and sets himself down at #one# of the public #house# #window# behind the little red curtain with his #hat# on all ready to bolt out at a #moment# notice
but we re sure to have him for between ten and eleven clock at #night# he passed again he was smoking his pipe here late at #night# when all of a sudden chickweed roars out here he is
away goes spyers on goes chickweed round turns the #people# everybody roars out thieves and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the #time# like mad
spyers loses sight of him a #minute# as he turns a #corner# shoots round sees a little crowd dives in which is the #man#
stop thief murder jem spyers dashes out and there he sees chickweed a tearing down the #street# full cry me says chickweed i ve lost him again
next #morning# spyers took his old #place# and looked out from behind the curtain for a tall #man# with a black patch over his #eye# till his own two #eye# ached again
at last he couldnt help shutting em to ease em a #minute# and the very #moment# he did so he hears chickweed a roaring out here he is
off he starts once more with chickweed half #way# down the #street# ahead of him and after twice as long a run as the yesterday #one# the #man# lost again
this was done once or twice more till #one# half the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arterwards and the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief what did jem spyers say
it was a remarkable occurrence but he warnt to be seen nowhere so they went back to the public #house# inquired the #doctor# who had returned to the #room# shortly after the commencement of the story
jem spyers resumed the officer for a long #time# said #nothing# at all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he understood his business
but #one# #morning# he walked into the bar and taking out his snuffbox says chickweed i ve found out who done this here robbery
have you said chickweed oh my #dear# spyers only let me have wengeance and i shall die contented oh my #dear# spyers where is the villain
so he had and a good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would never have found it out if he hadnt been so precious anxious to keep up appearances said mr blathers putting down his wine glass and clinking the handcuffs together
come said spyers offering him a pinch of snuff none of that gammon you did it yourself very curious indeed observed the #doctor#
now if you please you can walk upstairs if you please #sir# returned mr blathers closely following $mr_losberne$ the two officers ascended to $oliver_twist$ bedroom $mr_giles$ preceding the party with a lighted candle
being assisted by the #doctor# he managed to sit up in #bed# for a #minute# or so and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward in fact without seeming to recollect where he was or what had been passing
this said $mr_losberne$ speaking softly but with great vehemence notwithstanding this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on mr what ye call him #ground# at the back here comes to the #house# for assistance this #morning# and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that ingenious #gentleman# with the candle in his #hand# who has placed his #life# in considerable danger as i can professionally certify
$oliver_twist$ had been dozing but looked worse and was more feverish than he had appeared yet messrs blathers and $duff$ looked at $mr_giles$ as he was thus recommended to their notice
the bewildered butler gazed from them towards $oliver_twist$ and from $oliver_twist$ towards $mr_losberne$ with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity
you dont mean to deny that i suppose said the #doctor# laying $oliver_twist$ gently down again it was all done for the for the best #sir# answered $mr_giles$
i am sure i #thought# it was the #boy# or i wouldnt have meddled with him i am not of an inhuman disposition #sir#
#thought# it was what #boy# inquired the senior officer the housebreaker #boy# #sir# replied $mr_giles$ they they certainly had a #boy#
well do you think so now inquired blathers think what now replied $mr_giles$ looking vacantly at his questioner
think it the same #boy# stupid #head# rejoined blathers impatiently i dont know i really dont know said $mr_giles$ with a rueful countenance
i couldnt swear to him what do you think asked mr blathers i dont know what to think replied poor $mr_giles$
i dont think it is the #boy# indeed i almost certain that it isnt you know it cant be has this #man# been a drinking #sir# inquired blathers turning to the #doctor#
$mr_losberne$ had been feeling the patient pulse during this short dialogue but he now $miss_rose$ from the #chair# by the bedside and remarked that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject they would perhaps like to step into the next #room# and have brittles before them
acting upon this suggestion they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment where mr brittles being called in involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular #light# on #anything# but the fact of his own strong mystification except indeed his declarations that he shouldnt know the real #boy# if he were put before him that instant that he had only taken $oliver_twist$ to be he because $mr_giles$ had said he was and that $mr_giles$ had five #minute# previously admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty
among other ingenious surmises the question was then raised whether $mr_giles$ had really hit anybody and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the #doctor# who had drawn the ball about ten #minute# before
what a precious muddle headed chap you are said $duff$ addressing $mr_giles$ with supreme contempt upon no #one# however did it make a greater impression than on $mr_giles$ himself
who after labouring for some #hour# under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow creature eagerly caught at this new idea and favoured it to the utmost
finally the officers without troubling themselves very much about $oliver_twist$ left the chertsey constable in the #house# and took up their rest for that #night# in the town promising to return the next #morning#
with the next #morning# there came a rumour that two #man# and a #boy# were in the cage at kingston who had been apprehended over #night# under suspicious circumstances and to kingston messrs blathers and $duff$ journeyed accordingly
the suspicious circumstances however resolving themselves on investigation into the #one# fact that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack which although a great crime is only punishable by imprisonment and is in the merciful #eye# of the english law and its comprehensive love of all the king subjects held to be no satisfactory proof in the absence of all other evidence that the sleeper or sleepers have committed burglary accompanied with violence and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of #death# messrs blathers and $duff$ came back again as wise as they went
in short after some more examination and a great deal more conversation a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of $mrs_maylie$ and $mr_losberne$ for $oliver_twist$ appearance if he should ever be called upon and blathers and $duff$ being rewarded with a couple of guineas returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition the latter #gentleman# on a mature consideration of all the circumstances inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the family pet and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great mr conkey chickweed
if fervent prayers gushing from #heart# overcharged with gratitude be heard in heaven and if they be not what prayers are the blessings which the orphan #child# called down upon them sunk into their souls diffusing peace and happiness
#chapter# xxxii of the happy #life# $oliver_twist$ began to lead with his kind #friend# $oliver_twist$ ailings were neither slight nor few
in addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague which hung about him for many weeks and reduced him sadly
but at #length# he began by slow degrees to get better and to be able to say sometimes in a few tearful #word# how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet #lady# and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again he could do #something# to show his gratitude only #something# which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full #something# however slight which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away but that the poor #boy# whom their charity had rescued from misery or #death# was eager to serve them with his whole #heart# and soul
meanwhile $oliver_twist$ gradually throve and prospered under the united care of $mrs_maylie$ $miss_rose$ and the kind hearted $mr_losberne$ poor fellow
said $miss_rose$ when $oliver_twist$ had been #one# #day# feebly endeavouring to utter the #word# of thankfulness that $miss_rose$ to his pale lips you shall have many opportunities of serving us if you will
the quiet #place# the pure #air# and all the pleasure and beauties of spring will restore you in a few #day#
we are going into the country and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us we will employ you in a hundred #way# when you can bear the trouble the trouble cried $oliver_twist$
#dear# #lady# if i could but work for you if i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers or watching your birds or running up and down the whole #day# long to make you happy what would i give to do it
you shall give #nothing# at all said $miss_maylie$ smiling for as i told you before we shall employ you in a hundred #way# and if you only take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make me very happy indeed
oh happy ma am cried $oliver_twist$ how kind of you to say so you will make me happier than i can tell you replied the young #lady#
to think that my #dear# good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any #one# from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an unspeakable pleasure to me but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence would delight me more than you can well imagine
do you understand me she inquired watching $oliver_twist$ thoughtful #face# oh yes ma am yes replied $oliver_twist$ eagerly but i was thinking that i am ungrateful now
to whom inquired the young #lady# to the kind #gentleman# and the #dear# old nurse who took so much care of me before rejoined $oliver_twist$
i am sure they would rejoined $oliver_twist$ benefactress and $mr_losberne$ has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them
if they knew how happy i am they would be pleased i am sure has he ma am cried $oliver_twist$ his #face# brightening with pleasure
i dont know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind #face# once again in a short #time# $oliver_twist$ was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition
#one# #morning# he and $mr_losberne$ set out accordingly in a little carriage which belonged to $mrs_maylie$ when they came to chertsey bridge $oliver_twist$ turned very pale and uttered a loud exclamation
what the #matter# with the #boy# cried the #doctor# as usual all in a bustle do you see #anything# hear #anything# feel #anything# eh
that #sir# cried $oliver_twist$ pointing out of the carriage #window# that #house# yes well what of it stop coachman
pull up here cried the #doctor# what of the #house# my #man# eh the thieves the #house# they took me to whispered $oliver_twist$
but before the coachman could dismount from his box he had tumbled out of the coach by some means or other and running down to the deserted tenement began kicking at the #door# like a madman
halloa said a little ugly hump backed #man# opening the #door# so suddenly that the #doctor# from the very impetus of his last kick nearly fell forward into the passage
the devil it is cried the #doctor# hallo there let me out what the #matter# here #matter# exclaimed the other collaring him without a #moment# reflection
a good deal robbery is the #matter# there ll be murder the #matter# too replied the hump backed #man# coolly if you dont take your #hand# off
do you hear me i hear you said the #doctor# giving his captive a hearty shake where confound the fellow what his rascally #name# $mr_william_sikes$ that it
the hump backed #man# stared as if in excess of amazement and indignation then twisting himself dexterously from the #doctor# grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the #house#
where $mr_william_sikes$ you thief before he could shut the #door# however the #doctor# had passed into the parlour without a #word# of parley
he looked anxiously round not an article of furniture not a vestige of #anything# animate or inanimate not even the position of the cupboards answered $oliver_twist$ description
now said the hump backed #man# who had watched him keenly what do you mean by coming into my #house# in this violent #way#
did you ever know a #man# come out to do either in a chariot and pair you ridiculous old vampire said the irritable #doctor#
do you want to rob me or to murder me which is it what do you want then demanded the hunchback
as soon as i think proper said $mr_losberne$ looking into the other parlour which like the first bore no resemblance whatever to $oliver_twist$ account of it
will you take yourself off before i do you a mischief curse you i shall find you out some #day# my #friend#
will you sneered the ill favoured cripple if you ever want me i here i havent lived here mad and all alone for five and twenty #year# to be scared by you
and so saying the mis shapen little demon set up a yell and danced upon the #ground# as if wild with rage
you shall pay for this you shall pay for this stupid enough this muttered the #doctor# to himself the #boy# must have made a mistake
here put that in your #pocket# and shut yourself up again with these #word# he flung the hunchback a piece of money and returned to the carriage
the #man# followed to the chariot #door# uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the #way# but as $mr_losberne$ turned to speak to the driver he looked into the carriage and eyed $oliver_twist$ for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same #time# so furious and vindictive that waking or sleeping he could not forget it for months afterwards
he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations until the driver had resumed his seat and when they were once more on their #way# they could see him some distance behind beating his #foot# upon the #ground# and tearing his hair in transports of real or pretended rage
i am an ass said the #doctor# after a long #silence# did you know that before $oliver_twist$ no #sir#
then dont forget it another #time# an ass said the #doctor# again after a further #silence# of some #minute#
even if it had been the right #place# and the right fellows had been there what could i have done single handed
and if i had had assistance i see no good that i should have done except leading to my own exposure and an unavoidable statement of the #manner# in which i have hushed up this business
that would have served me right though i am always involving myself in some scrape or other by acting on impulse
now the fact was that the excellent #doctor# had never acted upon #anything# but impulse all through his #life# and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him
if the truth must be told he was a little out of temper for a #minute# or two at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of $oliver_twist$ story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any
he soon came round again however and finding that $oliver_twist$ replies to his questions were still as straightforward and consistent and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth as they had ever been he made up his #mind# to attach full credence to them from that #time# forth
it might have done me good as $oliver_twist$ knew the #name# of the #street# in which $mr_brownlow$ resided they were enabled to drive straight thither
when the coach turned into it his #heart# beat so violently that he could scarcely draw his breath now my #boy# which #house# is it inquired $mr_losberne$
that that replied $oliver_twist$ pointing eagerly out of the #window# the white #house# oh make haste pray make haste i feel as if i should die it makes me tremble so
come come said the good #doctor# patting him on the shoulder you will see them directly and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well
oh i hope so cried $oliver_twist$ they were so good to me so very very good to me the coach rolled on
it stopped no that was the wrong #house# the next #door# it went on a few paces and stopped again $oliver_twist$ looked up at the #window# with #tear# of happy expectation coursing down his #face#
alas the white #house# was empty and there was a $bill_sikes$ in the #window# to let knock at the next #door# cried $mr_losberne$ taking $oliver_twist$ #arm# in his
what has become of $mr_brownlow$ who used to live in the adjoining #house# do you know the servant did not know but would go and inquire
she presently returned and said that $mr_brownlow$ had sold off his goods and gone to the west indies six weeks before
$oliver_twist$ clasped his #hand# and sank feebly backward has his housekeeper gone too inquired $mr_losberne$ after a #moment# pause
yes #sir# replied the servant the old #gentleman# the housekeeper and a #gentleman# who was a #friend# of $mr_brownlow$ all went together
then turn towards home again said $mr_losberne$ to the driver and dont stop to bait the horses till you get out of this confounded london
the #book# stall keeper #sir# said $oliver_twist$ i know the #way# there see him pray #sir# do see him
if we go to the #book# stall keeper we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his #house# on #fire# or run away
my poor #boy# this is disappointment enough for #one# #day# said the #doctor# quite enough for both of us no home again straight
this bitter disappointment caused $oliver_twist$ much sorrow and grief even in the midst of his happiness for he had pleased himself many #time# during his illness with thinking of all that $mr_brownlow$ and $mrs_bedwin$ would say to him and what delight it would be to tell them how many long #day# and #night# he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him and in bewailing his cruel separation from them
the hope of eventually clearing himself with them too and explaining how he had been forced away had buoyed him up and sustained him under many of his recent trials and now the idea that they should have gone so far and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying #day# was almost more than he could bear
and in obedience to the #doctor# impulse home they went the circumstance occasioned no alteration however in the behaviour of his benefactors
after another fortnight when the fine warm weather had fairly begun and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms they made preparations for quitting the #house# at chertsey for some months
sending the plate which had so excited $mr_fagin$ cupidity to the banker and leaving $mr_giles$ and another servant in care of the #house# they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country and took $oliver_twist$ with them
who can describe the pleasure and delight the peace of #mind# and soft tranquillity the sickly #boy# felt in the balmy #air# and among the green hills and rich woods of an inland village
who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the #mind# of pain worn dwellers in close and noisy #place# and carry their own freshness deep into their jaded #heart#
#man# who have lived in crowded pent up #street# through #life# of toil and who have never wished for change #man# to whom custom has indeed been second nature and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks even they with the #hand# of #death# upon them have been known to yearn at last for #one# short glimpse of nature #face# and carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being
crawling forth from #day# to #day# to some green sunny spot they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky and hill and plain and glistening #water# that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline and they have sunk into their tombs as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber #window# but a few #hour# before faded from their dim and feeble sight
their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved may purify our #thought# and bear down before it old enmity and hatred but beneath all this there lingers in the least reflective #mind# a vague and half formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before in some remote and distant #time# which calls up solemn #thought# of distant #time# to come and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it
the memories which peaceful country scenes call up are not of this world nor of its #thought# and hopes it was a lovely spot to which they repaired
$oliver_twist$ whose #day# had been spent among squalid crowds and in the midst of noise and brawling seemed to enter on a new existence there
the $miss_rose$ and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees and the garden flowers perfumed the #air# with delicious odours
hard by was a little churchyard not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones but full of humble mounds covered with fresh turf and moss beneath which the old #people# of the village lay at rest
$oliver_twist$ often wandered here and thinking of the wretched grave in which his #mother# lay would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen but when he raised his #eye# to the deep sky overhead he would cease to think of her as lying in the #ground# and would weep for her sadly but without pain
the #day# were peaceful and serene the #night# brought with them neither fear nor care no languishing in a wretched prison or associating with wretched #man# #nothing# but pleasant and happy #thought#
every #morning# he went to a white headed old #gentleman# who lived near the little church who taught him to read better and to write and who spoke so kindly and took such pains that $oliver_twist$ could never try enough to please him
then he would walk with $mrs_maylie$ and $miss_rose$ and hear them talk of #book# or perhaps sit near them in some shady #place# and listen whilst the young #lady# read which he could have done until it grew too dark to see the letters
then he had his own lesson for the next #day# to prepare and at this he would work hard in a little #room# which looked into the garden till evening came slowly on when the #lady# would walk out again and he with them listening with such pleasure to all they said and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach or had forgotten #anything# he could run to fetch that he could never be quick enough about it
when it became quite dark and they returned home the young #lady# would sit down to the piano and play some pleasant #air# or sing in a low and gentle #voice# some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear
there would be no candles lighted at such #time# as these and $oliver_twist$ would sit by #one# of the #window# listening to the sweet music in a perfect rapture
and when sunday came how differently the #day# was spent from any #way# in which he had ever spent it yet
there was the little church in the #morning# with the green leaves fluttering at the #window# the birds singing without and the sweet smelling #air# stealing in at the low porch and filling the homely building with its fragrance
the poor #people# were so neat and clean and knelt so reverently in prayer that it seemed a pleasure not a tedious duty their assembling there together and though the singing might be rude it was real and sounded more musical to $oliver_twist$ ears at least than any he had ever heard in church before
then there were the walks as usual and many calls at the clean #house# of the labouring #man# and at #night# $oliver_twist$ read a #chapter# or two from the bible which he had been studying all the week and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased than if he had been the clergyman himself
in the #morning# $oliver_twist$ would be a #foot# by six clock roaming the fields and plundering the hedges far and wide for nosegays of wild flowers with which he would return laden home and which it took great care and consideration to arrange to the best advantage for the embellishment of the breakfast #table#
there was fresh groundsel too for $miss_maylie$ birds with which $oliver_twist$ who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk would decorate the cages in the most approved taste
when the birds were made all spruce and smart for the #day# there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village or failing that there was rare cricket playing sometimes on the green or failing that there was always #something# to do in the garden or about the plants to which $oliver_twist$ who had studied this science also under the same #master# who was a gardener by trade applied himself with hearty good will until $miss_rose$ made her appearance when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done
so three months glided away three months which in the #life# of the most blessed and favoured of mortals might have been unmingled happiness and which in $oliver_twist$ were true felicity
with the purest and most amiable generosity on #one# #side# and the truest warmest soul felt gratitude on the other it is no wonder that by the end of that short #time# $oliver_twist$ had become completely domesticated with the old #lady# and her niece and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive #heart# was repaid by their pride in and attachment to himself
it was a happy #time# and how happily too like all the other #day# in that most happy #time# #chapter# xxxiii wherein the happiness of $oliver_twist$ and his #friend# experiences
a sudden check spring flew swiftly by and summer came if the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness
the great trees which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months had now burst into strong #life# and health and stretching forth their green #arm# over the thirsty #ground# converted open and naked spots into choice nooks where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to #look# upon the wide prospect steeped in sunshine which lay stretched beyond
the earth had donned her mantle of brightest green and shed her richest perfumes abroad it was the prime and vigour of the #year# all #thing# were glad and flourishing
$oliver_twist$ had long since grown stout and healthy but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many #people#
he was still the same gentle attached affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength and when he was dependent for every slight attention and comfort on those who tended him
#one# beautiful #night# when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them for the #day# had been unusually warm and there was a brilliant moon and a #light# wind had sprung up which was unusually refreshing
$miss_rose$ had been in high spirits too and they had walked on in merry conversation until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds
still the same quiet #life# went on at the little cottage and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates $mrs_maylie$ being fatigued they returned more slowly home
after running abstractedly over the keys for a few #minute# she fell into a low and very solemn #air# and as she played it they heard a sound as if she were weeping
the young #lady# merely throwing off her simple bonnet sat down to the piano as usual $miss_rose$ my #dear# said the elder #lady#
$miss_rose$ made no reply but played a little quicker as though the #word# had roused her from some painful #thought#
$miss_rose$ my love cried $mrs_maylie$ rising hastily and bending over her what is this in #tear# my #dear# #child# what distresses you
i dont know what it is i cant describe it but i feel not ill my love interposed $mrs_maylie$
#nothing# aunt #nothing# replied the young #lady# no no oh not ill replied $miss_rose$ shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her while she spoke i shall be better presently
the young #lady# making an effort to recover her cheerfulness strove to play some livelier tune but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys
covering her #face# with her #hand# she sank upon a sofa and gave vent to the #tear# which she was now unable to repress
close the #window# pray $oliver_twist$ hastened to comply with her request my #child# said the elderly #lady# folding her #arm# about her i never saw you so before
i would not alarm you if i could avoid it rejoined $miss_rose$ but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this
she was indeed for when candles were brought they saw that in the very short #time# which had elapsed since their return home the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness
its expression had lost #nothing# of its beauty but it was changed and there was an anxious haggard #look# about the gentle #face# which it had never worn before
i fear i am ill aunt another #minute# and it was suffused with a crimson flush and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue #eye#
$oliver_twist$ who watched the old #lady# anxiously observed that she was alarmed by these appearances and so in truth was he but seeing that she affected to make #light# of them he endeavoured to do the same and they so far succeeded that when $miss_rose$ was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the #night# she was in better spirits and appeared even in better health assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the #morning# quite well
again this disappeared like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud and she was once more deadly pale i hope said $oliver_twist$ when $mrs_maylie$ returned that #nothing# is the #matter#
the old #lady# motioned to him not to speak and sitting herself down in a dark #corner# of the #room# remained silent for some #time#
she dont #look# well to #night# but at #length# she said in a trembling #voice# i hope not $oliver_twist$ i have been very happy with her for some #year# too happy perhaps
it may be #time# that i should meet with some misfortune but i hope it is not this what inquired $oliver_twist$
the heavy blow said the old #lady# of losing the #dear# #girl# who has so long been my comfort and happiness
oh god forbid exclaimed $oliver_twist$ hastily amen to that my #child# said the old #lady# wringing her #hand#
surely there is no danger of #anything# so dreadful said $oliver_twist$ two #hour# ago she was quite well she is very ill now rejoined mrs maylies and will be worse i am sure
she gave #way# to such great grief that $oliver_twist$ suppressing his own emotion ventured to remonstrate with her and to beg earnestly that for the sake of the #dear# young #lady# herself she would be more calm
and consider ma am said $oliver_twist$ as the #tear# forced themselves into his #eye# despite of his efforts to the contrary
my #dear# dear $miss_rose$ oh what shall i do without her oh consider how young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her
i am sure certain quite certain that for your sake who are so good yourself and for her own and for the sake of all she makes so happy she will not die
heaven will never let her die so young hush said $mrs_maylie$ laying her #hand# on $oliver_twist$ #head# you think like a #child# poor #boy#
i had forgotten it for a #moment# $oliver_twist$ but i hope i may be pardoned for i am old and have seen enough of illness and #death# to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love
i have seen enough too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them but this should give us comfort in our sorrow for heaven is just and such #thing# teach us impressively that there is a brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy
$oliver_twist$ was surprised to see that as $mrs_maylie$ said these #word# she checked her lamentations as though by #one# effort and drawing herself up as she spoke became composed and firm
he was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted and that under all the care and watching which ensued $mrs_maylie$ was ever ready and collected performing all the duties which had devolved upon her steadily and to all external appearances even cheerfully
but you teach me my duty notwithstanding god will be done i love her and he knows how well but he was young and did not know what strong #mind# are capable of under trying circumstances
how should he when their possessors so seldom know themselves an anxious #night# ensued when #morning# came $mrs_maylie$ predictions were but too well verified
we must be active $oliver_twist$ and not give #way# to useless grief said $mrs_maylie$ laying her finger on her lip as she looked steadily into his #face# this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to $mr_losberne$
it must be carried to the market town which is not more than four miles off by the footpath across the field and thence dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey
the #people# at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust to you to see it done i know
$miss_rose$ was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever $oliver_twist$ could make no reply but looked his anxiety to be gone at once
here is another letter said $mrs_maylie$ pausing to reflect but whether to send it now or wait until i see how $miss_rose$ goes on i scarcely know
is it for chertsey too ma am inquired $oliver_twist$ impatient to execute his commission and holding out his trembling #hand# for the letter
$oliver_twist$ glanced at it and saw that it was directed to $harry_maylie$ esquire at some great lord #house# in the country where he could not make out
i would not forward it unless i feared the worst no replied the old #lady# giving it to him mechanically shall it go ma am
asked $oliver_twist$ looking up impatiently i think not replied $mrs_maylie$ taking it back i will wait until to morrow
with these #word# she gave $oliver_twist$ her purse and he started off without more delay at the greatest speed he could muster
swiftly he ran across the fields and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them now almost hidden by the high corn on either #side# and now emerging on an open field where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work nor did he stop once save now
and then for a few seconds to recover breath until he came in a great heat and covered with dust on the little market #place# of the market town
there were a white bank and a red brewery and a yellow town hall and in #one# #corner# there was a large #house# with all the wood about it painted green before which was the sign of the george
he spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway and who after hearing what he wanted referred him to the ostler who after hearing all he had to say again referred him to the landlord who was a tall #gentleman# in a blue neckcloth a white #hat# drab breeches and boots with tops to match leaning against a pump by the stable #door# picking his teeth with a silver toothpick
this #gentleman# walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the $bill_sikes$ which took a long #time# making out and after it was ready and paid a horse had to be saddled and a #man# to be dressed which took up ten good #minute# more
meanwhile $oliver_twist$ was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself and galloped away full #tear# to the next stage
at #length# all was ready and the little parcel having been handed up with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery the #man# set spurs to his horse and rattling over the uneven paving of the market #place# was out of the town and galloping along the turnpike road in a couple of #minute#
as it was #something# to feel certain that assistance was sent for and that no #time# had been lost $oliver_twist$ hurried up the inn yard with a somewhat lighter #heart#
he was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall #man# wrapped in a cloak who was at that #moment# coming out of the inn #door#
here he paused and looked about for the inn to this he hastened as soon as it caught his #eye# hah cried the #man# fixing his #eye# on $oliver_twist$ and suddenly recoiling
i beg your pardon #sir# said $oliver_twist$ i was in a great hurry to get home and didnt see you were coming
what the devil this #death# muttered the #man# to himself glaring at the #boy# with his large dark #eye#
who would have #thought# it grind him to ashes he start up from a stone coffin to come in my #way#
i am sorry stammered $oliver_twist$ confused by the strange #man# wild #look# i hope i have not hurt you rot you
murmured the #man# in a horrible passion between his clenched teeth if i had only had the courage to say the #word# i might have been free of you in a #night#
curses on your #head# and black #death# on your #heart# you imp what are you doing here the #man# shook his fist as he uttered these #word# incoherently
he advanced towards $oliver_twist$ as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him but fell violently on the #ground# writhing and foaming in a fit
$oliver_twist$ gazed for a #moment# at the struggles of the madman for such he supposed him to be and then darted into the #house# for help
having seen him safely carried into the hotel he turned his #face# homewards running as fast as he could to make up for lost #time# and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear the extraordinary behaviour of the #person# from whom he had just parted
the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long however for when he reached the cottage there was enough to occupy his #mind# and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory
a medical practitioner who resided on the spot was in constant attendance upon her and after first seeing the patient he had taken $mrs_maylie$ aside and pronounced her disorder to be #one# of a most alarming nature
$miss_rose$ maylie had rapidly grown worse before mid #night# she was delirious in fact he said it would be little short of a miracle if she recovered
how often did $oliver_twist$ start from his #bed# that #night# and stealing out with noiseless footstep to the staircase listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber
how often did a tremble shake his frame and cold drops of terror start upon his brow when a sudden trampling of #foot# caused him to fear that #something# too dreadful to think of had even then occurred
and what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered compared with those he poured forth now in the agony and passion of his supplication for the #life# and health of the gentle creature who was tottering on the deep grave verge
oh the suspense the fearful acute suspense of standing idly by while the #life# of #one# we dearly love is trembling in the balance
the racking #thought# that crowd upon the #mind# and make the #heart# beat violently and the breath come thick by the force of the images they conjure up before it the desperate anxiety to be doing #something# to relieve the pain or lessen the danger which we have no power to alleviate the sinking of soul and spirit which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces what tortures can equal these what reflections or endeavours can in the full tide and fever of the #time# allay them
#people# spoke in whispers anxious #face# appeared at the gate from #time# to #time# #woman# and #child# went away in #tear#
all the livelong #day# and for #hour# after it had grown dark $oliver_twist$ paced softly up and down the garden raising his #eye# every instant to the sick chamber and shuddering to see the darkened #window# looking as if #death# lay stretched inside
it is hard said the good #doctor# turning away as he spoke so young so much beloved but there is very little hope
the sun shone brightly as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care and with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her with #life# and health and sounds and sights of joy surrounding her on every #side# the fair young creature lay wasting fast
$oliver_twist$ crept away to the old churchyard and sitting down on #one# of the green mounds wept and prayed for her in #silence#
there was such peace and beauty in the scene so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook careering overhead so much of #life# and joyousness in all that when the #boy# raised his aching #eye# and looked about the #thought# instinctively occurred to him that this was not a #time# for #death# that $miss_rose$ could surely never die when humbler #thing# were all so glad and gay that graves were for cold and cheerless winter not for sunlight and fragrance
he almost #thought# that shrouds were for the old and shrunken and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds
oh #morning# came and the little cottage was lonely and still late that #night# $mr_losberne$ arrived another #morning# a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful #thought#
another again it was tolling for the funeral service a group of humble mourners entered the gate wearing white favours for the corpse was young
they stood uncovered by a grave and there was a #mother# a #mother# once among the weeping train but the sun shone brightly and the birds sang on
$oliver_twist$ turned homeward thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young #lady# and wishing that the #time# could come again that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was
he had no cause for self reproach on the score of neglect or want of #thought# for he had been devoted to her service and yet a hundred little occasions $miss_rose$ up before him on which he fancied he might have been more zealous and more earnest and wished he had been
we need be careful how we deal with those about us when every #death# carries to some small circle of survivors #thought# of so much omitted and so little done of so many #thing# forgotten and so many more which might have been repaired
there is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing if we would be spared its tortures let us remember this in #time#
$oliver_twist$ #heart# sank at sight of her for she had never left the bedside of her niece and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away
he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep from which she would waken either to recovery and #life# or to bid them farewell and die
when he reached home $mrs_maylie$ was sitting in the little parlour they sat listening and afraid to speak for #hour#
the untasted meal was removed with #look# which showed that their #thought# were elsewhere they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower and at #length# cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure
their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep they both involuntarily darted to the #door# as $mr_losberne$ entered
what of $miss_rose$ cried the old #lady# tell me at once i can bear it #anything# but suspense oh tell me
in the #name# of heaven you must compose yourself said the #doctor# supporting her be calm my #dear# ma am pray
let me go in god #name# my #dear# #child# she is dead she is dying no cried the #doctor# passionately
the #lady# fell upon her knees and tried to fold her #hand# together but the energy which had supported her so long fled up to heaven with her first thanksgiving and she sank into the friendly #arm# which were extended to receive her
as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for #year# to come #chapter# xxxiv contains some
introductory particulars relative to a young #gentleman# who now arrives upon the scene and a new adventure which happened to $oliver_twist$
it was almost too much happiness to bear $oliver_twist$ felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence he could not weep or speak or rest
he had scarcely the power of understanding #anything# that had passed until after a long ramble in the quiet evening #air# a burst of #tear# came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast
the #night# was fast closing in when he returned homeward laden with flowers which he had culled with peculiar care for the adornment of the sick chamber
as he walked briskly along the road he heard behind him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace
looking round he saw that it was a post chaise driven at great speed and as the horses were galloping and the road was narrow he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him
as it dashed on $oliver_twist$ caught a glimpse of a #man# in a white nightcap whose #face# seemed familiar to him although his view was so brief that he could not identify the #person#
in another second or two the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise #window# and a stentorian #voice# bellowed to the driver to stop which he did as soon as he could pull up his horses
then the nightcap once again appeared and the same #voice# called $oliver_twist$ by his #name# here cried the #voice#
$mr_giles$ popped out his nightcap again preparatory to making some reply when he was suddenly pulled back by a young #gentleman# who occupied the other #corner# of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news
$oliver_twist$ what the news $miss_rose$ #master# li ver is it you $mr_giles$ cried $oliver_twist$ running up to the chaise #door# in a #word# cried the #gentleman# better or worse
better much better replied $oliver_twist$ hastily thank heaven exclaimed the #gentleman# you are sure quite #sir# replied $oliver_twist$
the #gentleman# said not another #word# but opening the chaise #door# leaped out and taking $oliver_twist$ hurriedly by the #arm# led him aside
the change took #place# only a few #hour# ago and $mr_losberne$ says that all danger is at an end you are quite certain
there is no possibility of any mistake on your #part# my #boy# is there demanded the #gentleman# in a tremulous #voice#
do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled i would not for the world #sir# replied $oliver_twist$
indeed you may believe me $mr_losberne$ #word# were that she would live to bless us all for many #year# to come
the #tear# stood in $oliver_twist$ #eye# as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness and the #gentleman# turned his #face# away and remained silent for some #minute#
$oliver_twist$ #thought# he heard him sob more than once but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark for he could well guess what his feelings were and so stood apart feigning to be occupied with his nosegay
all this #time# $mr_giles$ with the white nightcap on had been sitting on the steps of the chaise supporting an elbow on each knee and wiping his #eye# with a blue cotton #pocket# handkerchief dotted with white spots
that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion was abundantly demonstrated by the very red #eye# with which he regarded the young #gentleman# when he turned round and addressed him
i heard him say so i think you had better go on to my #mother# in the chaise $mr_giles$ said he
i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little #time# before i see her you can say i am coming
i beg your pardon mr $harry_maylie$ said $mr_giles$ giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief
it wouldnt be proper for the maids to see me in this state #sir# i should never have any more authority with them if they did
but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you well rejoined $harry_maylie$ smiling you can do as you like
let him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering or we shall be taken for madmen
$mr_giles$ reminded of his unbecoming costume snatched off and pocketed his nightcap and substituted a #hat# of grave and sober shape which he took out of the chaise
this done the postboy drove off $mr_giles$ mr maylie and $oliver_twist$ followed at their leisure as they walked along $oliver_twist$ glanced from #time# to #time# with much interest and curiosity at the new comer
he seemed about five and twenty #year# of age and was of the middle height his countenance was frank and handsome and his demeanor easy and prepossessing
notwithstanding the difference between youth and age he bore so strong a likeness to the old #lady# that $oliver_twist$ would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship if he had not already spoken of her as his #mother#
$mrs_maylie$ was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage the meeting did not take #place# without great emotion on both #side#
#mother# whispered the young #man# why did you not write before i did replied $mrs_maylie$ but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard $mr_losberne$ opinion
but why said the young #man# why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened if $miss_rose$ had i cannot utter that #word# now if this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself
if that had been the case $harry_maylie$ said $mrs_maylie$ i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a #day# sooner or a #day# later would have been of very very little import
how could i ever have know happiness again and who can wonder if it be so #mother# rejoined the young #man# or why should i say if
#mother# you must know it i know that she deserves the best and purest love the #heart# of #man# can offer said $mrs_maylie$ i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but #one# that shall be deep and lasting
if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in #one# she loved would break her #heart# i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty
do you still suppose that i am a #boy# ignorant of my own #mind# and mistaking the impulses of my own soul
i think my #dear# son returned $mrs_maylie$ laying her #hand# upon his shoulder that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting
above all i think said the #lady# fixing her #eye# on her son #face# that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious #man# marry a wife on whose #name# there is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid #people# upon her and upon his #child# also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him he may no #matter# how generous and good his nature #one# #day# repent of the connection he formed in early #life#
it is it is you know it this is unkind #mother# said $harry_maylie$ and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so
#mother# said the young #man# impatiently he would be a selfish brute unworthy alike of the #name# of #man# and of the #woman# you describe who acted thus
the mental agony i have suffered during the last two #day# wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not #one# of yesterday nor #one# i have lightly formed
you think so now $harry_maylie$ replied his #mother# and ever will said the young #man# on $miss_rose$ sweet gentle #girl#
i have no #thought# no view no hope in #life# beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your #hand# and cast them to the wind
#mother# think better of this and of me and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little
$harry_maylie$ said $mrs_maylie$ it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive #heart# that i would spare them from being wounded
my #heart# is set as firmly as ever #heart# of #man# was set on #woman# but we have said enough and more than enough on this #matter# just now
let it rest with $miss_rose$ then interposed $harry_maylie$ you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my #way#
i will not rejoined $mrs_maylie$ but i would have you consider i have considered was the impatient reply #mother# i have considered #year# and #year#
my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good
i have considered ever since i have been capable of serious reflection no before i leave this #place# $miss_rose$ shall hear me
there is #something# in your #manner# which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly #mother# said the young #man#
she shall said $mrs_maylie$ not coldly rejoined the old #lady# far from it how then urged the young #man#
she has formed no other attachment no indeed replied his #mother# you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already
before you stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few #moment# my #dear# #child# on $miss_rose$ history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision devoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble #mind# and with that perfect sacrifice of self which in all #matter# great or trifling has always been her characteristic
what i would say resumed the old #lady# stopping her son as he was about to speak is this what do you mean
that i leave you to discover replied $mrs_maylie$ i must go back to her god bless you i shall see you again to #night# said the young #man# eagerly
by and by replied the #lady# when i leave $miss_rose$ you will tell her i am here said $harry_maylie$
of course replied $mrs_maylie$ and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see her
you will not refuse to do this #mother# no said the old #lady# i will tell her all and pressing her son #hand# affectionately she hastened from the #room#
$mr_losberne$ and $oliver_twist$ had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding the former now held out his #hand# to $harry_maylie$ and hearty salutations were exchanged between them
the #doctor# then communicated in reply to multifarious questions from his young #friend# a precise account of his patient situation which was quite as consolatory and full of promise as $oliver_twist$ statement had encouraged him to hope and to the whole of which $mr_giles$ who affected to be busy about the luggage listened with greedy ears
have you shot #anything# particular lately $mr_giles$ inquired the #doctor# when he had concluded #nothing# particular #sir# replied $mr_giles$ colouring up to the #eye#
nor catching any thieves nor identifying any #house# breakers said the #doctor# none at all #sir# replied $mr_giles$ with much gravity
well said the #doctor# i am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of #thing# admirably pray how is brittles
the #boy# is very well #sir# said $mr_giles$ recovering his usual tone of patronage and sends his respectful duty #sir#
seeing you here reminds me $mr_giles$ that on the #day# before that on which i was called away so hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small commission in your favour
$mr_giles$ walked into the #corner# with much importance and some wonder and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the #doctor# on the termination of which he made a great many bows and retired with steps of unusual stateliness
the subject #matter# of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it for $mr_giles$ walked straight thither and having called for a mug of ale announced with an #air# of majesty which was highly effective that it had pleased his mistress in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery to deposit in the local savings bank the sum of five and twenty pounds for his sole use and benefit
at this the two #woman# servants lifted up their #hand# and #eye# and supposed that $mr_giles$ pulling out his shirt frill replied no no and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors he would thank them to tell him so
and then he made a great many other remarks no less illustrative of his humility which were received with equal favour and applause and were withal as original and as much to the purpose as the remarks of great #man# commonly are
above stairs the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away for the #doctor# was in high spirits and however fatigued or thoughtful $harry_maylie$ might have been at first he was not proof against the worthy #gentleman# good humour which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections and an abundance of small jokes which struck $oliver_twist$ as being the drollest #thing# he had ever heard and caused him to laugh proportionately to the evident satisfaction of the #doctor# who laughed immoderately at himself and made $harry_maylie$ laugh almost as heartily by the very force of sympathy
so they were as pleasant a party as under the circumstances they could well have been and it was late before they retired with #light# and thankful #heart# to take that rest of which after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone they stood much in need
$oliver_twist$ $miss_rose$ next #morning# in better #heart# and went about his usual occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many #day#
the birds were once more hung out to sing in their old #place# and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found were once more gathered to gladden $miss_rose$ with their beauty
the melancholy which had seemed to the sad #eye# of the anxious #boy# to hang for #day# past over every object beautiful as all were was dispelled by magic
the dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves the #air# to rustle among them with a sweeter music and the sky itself to #look# more blue and bright
that well said the #doctor# just step into this #corner# a #moment# will you such is the influence which the condition of our own #thought# exercise even over the appearance of external objects
#man# who #look# on nature and their fellow #man# and cry that all is dark and gloomy are in the right but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced #eye# and #heart#
it is worthy of remark and $oliver_twist$ did not fail to note it at the #time# that his #morning# expeditions were no longer made alone
$harry_maylie$ after the very first #morning# when he met $oliver_twist$ coming laden home was seized with such a passion for flowers and displayed such a taste in their arrangement as left his young #companion# far behind
if $oliver_twist$ were behindhand in these respects he knew where the best were to be found and #morning# after #morning# they scoured the country together and brought home the fairest that blossomed
the #window# of the young #lady# chamber was opened now for she loved to feel the rich summer #air# stream in and revive her with its freshness but there always stood in #water# just inside the lattice #one# particular little bunch which was made up with great care every #morning#
$oliver_twist$ could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away although the little vase was regularly replenished nor could he help observing that whenever the #doctor# came into the garden he invariably cast his #eye# up to that particular #corner# and nodded his #head# most expressively as he set forth on his #morning# walk
the real hues are delicate and need a clearer vision pending these observations the #day# were flying by and $miss_rose$ was rapidly recovering
nor did $oliver_twist$ #time# hang heavy on his #hand# although the young #lady# had not yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now and then for a short distance with $mrs_maylie$
he applied himself with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the white headed old #gentleman# and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself
it was while he was engaged in this pursuit that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence
the little #room# in which he was accustomed to sit when busy at his #book# was on the #ground# floor at the back of the #house#
it was quite a cottage #room# with a lattice #window# around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle that crept over the casement and filled the #place# with their delicious perfume
it looked into a garden whence a wicket gate opened into a small paddock all beyond was fine meadow land and wood there was no other dwelling near in that direction and the prospect it commanded was very extensive
#one# beautiful evening when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth $oliver_twist$ sat at this #window# intent upon his #book#
he had been poring over them for some #time# and as the #day# had been uncommonly sultry and he had exerted himself a great deal
it is no disparagement to the authors whoever they may have been to say that gradually and by slow degrees he fell asleep
there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes which while it holds the body prisoner does not free the #mind# from a sense of #thing# about it and enable it to ramble at its pleasure
so far as an overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter inability to control our #thought# or power of motion can be called sleep this is it and yet we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us and if we dream at such a #time# #word# which are really spoken or sounds which really exist at the #moment# accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost #matter# of impossibility to separate the two
it is an undoubted fact that although our senses of touch and sight be for the #time# dead yet our sleeping #thought# and the visionary scenes that pass before us will be influenced and materially influenced by the mere silent presence of some external object which may not have been near us when we closed our #eye# and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness
$oliver_twist$ knew perfectly well that he was in his own little #room# that his #book# were lying on the #table# before him that the sweet #air# was stirring among the creeping plants outside
suddenly the scene changed the #air# became close and confined and he #thought# with a glow of terror that he was in the jew #house# again
there sat the hideous old #man# in his accustomed #corner# pointing at him and whispering to another #man# with his #face# averted who sat beside him
nor is this the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state and yet he was asleep hush my #dear# he #thought# he heard the jew say it is he sure enough
if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and he stood amongst them there is #something# that would tell me how to point him out
if you buried him fifty #foot# deep and took me across his grave i fancy i should know if there wasnt a mark above it that he lay buried there
come away he the other #man# seemed to answer could i mistake him think you the #man# seemed to say this with such dreadful hatred that $oliver_twist$ awoke with the fear and started up
what was that which sent the blood tingling to his #heart# and deprived him of his #voice# and of power to move
there there at the #window# close before him so close that he could have almost touched him before he started back with his #eye# peering into the #room# and meeting his there stood the jew
and beside him white with rage or fear or both were the scowling features of the #man# who had accosted him in the inn yard
but they had recognised him and he them and their #look# was as firmly impressed upon his memory as if it had been deeply carved in stone and set before him from his birth
good heaven it was but an instant a glance a flash before his #eye# and they were gone he stood transfixed for a #moment# then leaping from the #window# into the garden called loudly for help
when the inmates of the #house# attracted by $oliver_twist$ cries hurried to the spot from which they proceeded they found him pale and agitated pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the #house# and scarcely able to articulate the #word# the jew the jew
$mr_giles$ was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant but $harry_maylie$ whose perceptions were #something# quicker and who had heard $oliver_twist$ history from his #mother# understood it at once
#chapter# xxxv containing the unsatisfactory result of $oliver_twist$ adventure and a conversation of some importance between $harry_maylie$ and $miss_rose$ what direction did he take
he asked catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a #corner# that replied $oliver_twist$ pointing out the course the #man# had taken i missed them in an instant
so saying he sprang over the hedge and darted off with a speed which rendered it #matter# of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him
$mr_giles$ followed as well as he could and $oliver_twist$ followed too and in the course of a #minute# or two $mr_losberne$ who had been out walking and just then returned tumbled over the hedge after them and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess struck into the same course at no contemptible speed shouting all the while most prodigiously to know what was the #matter#
on they all went nor stopped they once to breathe until the leader striking off into an angle of the field indicated by $oliver_twist$ began to search narrowly the ditch and hedge adjoining which afforded #time# for the remainder of the party to come up and for $oliver_twist$ to communicate to $mr_losberne$ the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit
then they are in the ditch said $harry_maylie$ follow and keep as near me as you can the search was all in vain
they stood now on the summit of a little hill commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles
there was the village in the hollow on the left but in order to gain that after pursuing the track $oliver_twist$ had pointed out the #man# must have made a circuit of open #ground# which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a #time#
a thick wood skirted the meadow land in another direction but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason
there were not even the traces of recent footsteps to be seen it must have been a dream $oliver_twist$ said $harry_maylie$
oh no indeed #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch countenance i saw him too plainly for that
i saw them both as plainly as i see you now who was the other inquired $harry_maylie$ and $mr_losberne$ together
the very same #man# i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the inn said $oliver_twist$ we had our #eye# fixed full upon each other and i could swear to him
they took this #way# demanded $harry_maylie$ are you sure as i am that the #man# were at the #window# replied $oliver_twist$ pointing down as he spoke to the hedge which divided the cottage garden from the meadow
the tall #man# leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap
the two #gentleman# watched $oliver_twist$ earnest #face# as he spoke and looking from him to each other seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said
still in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of #man# in hurried flight the grass was long but it was trodden down nowhere save where their own #foot# had crushed it
the #side# and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay but in no #one# #place# could they discern the print of #man# shoes or the slightest mark which would indicate that any #foot# had pressed the #ground# for #hour# before
notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search they did not desist until the coming on of #night# rendered its further prosecution hopeless and even then they gave it up with reluctance
$mr_giles$ was dispatched to the different ale #house# in the village furnished with the best description $oliver_twist$ could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers
of these the jew was at all events sufficiently remarkable to be remembered supposing he had been seen drinking or loitering about but $mr_giles$ returned without any intelligence calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery
this is strange said $harry_maylie$ strange echoed the #doctor# blathers and $duff$ themselves could make #nothing# of it on the next #day# fresh search was made and the inquiries renewed but with no better success
on the #day# following $oliver_twist$ and mr maylie repaired to the market town in the hope of seeing or hearing #something# of the #man# there but this effort was equally fruitless
after a few #day# the affair began to be forgotten as most affairs are when wonder having no fresh food to support it dies away of itself
she had left her #room# was able to go out and mixing once more with the family carried joy into the #heart# of all
but although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle and although cheerful #voice# and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage there was at #time# an unwonted restraint upon some there even upon $miss_rose$ herself which $oliver_twist$ could not fail to remark
$mrs_maylie$ and her son were often closeted together for a long #time# and more than once $miss_rose$ appeared with traces of #tear# upon her #face#
after $mr_losberne$ had fixed a #day# for his departure to chertsey these symptoms increased and it became evident that #something# was in progress which affected the peace of the young #lady# and of somebody else besides
at #length# #one# #morning# when $miss_rose$ was alone in the breakfast parlour $harry_maylie$ entered and with some hesitation begged permission to speak with her for a few #moment#
meanwhile $miss_rose$ was rapidly recovering a few a very few will suffice $miss_rose$ said the young #man# drawing his #chair# towards her
what i shall have to say has already presented itself to your #mind# the most cherished hopes of my #heart# are not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated
$miss_rose$ had been very pale from the #moment# of his entrance but that might have been the effect of her recent illness
she merely bowed and bending over some plants that stood near waited in #silence# for him to proceed i i ought to have left here before said $harry_maylie$
forgive me for saying so but i wish you had i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions said the young #man# the fear of losing the #one# #dear# being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed
we know that when the young the beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest we know heaven help us that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade in blooming
there were #tear# in the #eye# of the gentle #girl# as these #word# were spoken and when #one# fell upon the flower over which she bent and glistened brightly in its cup making it more beautiful it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young #heart# claimed kindred naturally with the loveliest #thing# in nature
a creature continued the young #man# passionately a creature as fair and innocent of guile as #one# of god own angels fluttered between #life# and #death#
you should indeed replied $miss_rose$ you had been dying trembling between earth and heaven oh who could hope when the distant world to which she was akin
$miss_rose$ rose to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow which a #light# from above casts upon the earth to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here hardly to know a reason why you should be to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight and yet to pray amid all these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved you these were distractions almost too great to bear
they were mine by #day# and #night# and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in its course
#day# by #day# and almost #hour# by #hour# some drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of #life# which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a high and rushing tide
i have watched you change almost from #death# to #life# with #eye# that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection
do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has softened my #heart# to all mankind i did not mean that said $miss_rose$ weeping i only wish you had left here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again to pursuits well worthy of you
there is no pursuit more worthy of me more worthy of the highest nature that exists than the struggle to win such a #heart# as yours said the young #man# taking her #hand#
half opened to her view that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this you recovered $miss_rose$ my own #dear# $miss_rose$
for #year# for #year# i have loved you hoping to win my #way# to fame and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy #moment# of the many silent tokens i had given of a #boy# attachment and claim your #hand# as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us
that #time# has not arrived but here with not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the #heart# so long your own and stake my all upon the #word# with which you greet the offer
your behaviour has ever been kind and noble said $miss_rose$ mastering the emotions by which she was agitated as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer
it is replied $miss_rose$ that you must endeavour to forget me not as your old and dearly attached #companion# for that would wound me deeply but as the object of your love
it is that i may endeavour to deserve you it is #dear# $miss_rose$ #look# into the world think how many #heart# you would be proud to gain are there
confide some other passion to me if you will i will be the truest warmest and most faithful #friend# you have
there was a pause during which $miss_rose$ who had covered her #face# with #one# #hand# gave free vent to her #tear#
$harry_maylie$ still retained the other and your reasons $miss_rose$ he said at #length# in a low #voice# your reasons for this decision
you have a right to know them rejoined $miss_rose$ you can say #nothing# to alter my resolution it is a duty that i must perform
i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless #girl# with a blight upon my #name# should not give your #friend# reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and fastened myself a clog on all your hopes and projects
i owe it to you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world
i owe it alike to others and to myself to yourself yes $harry_maylie$ if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty $harry_maylie$ began
they do not replied $miss_rose$ colouring deeply then you return my love said $harry_maylie$ say but that #dear# $miss_rose$ say but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment
if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved rejoined $miss_rose$ i could have have received this declaration very differently said $harry_maylie$
do not conceal that from me at least $miss_rose$ i could said $miss_rose$ stay she added disengaging her #hand# why should we prolong this painful interview
most painful to me and yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high #place# in your regard which i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in #life# will animate me with new fortitude and firmness
as we have met to #day# we meet no more but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest #heart# can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper you
farewell $harry_maylie$ another #word# $miss_rose$ said $harry_maylie$ your reason in your own #word# from your own lips let me hear it
all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help #man# in public #life# are in store for you
but those connections are proud and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the #mother# who gave me #life# nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that #mother# #place#
in a #word# said the young #lady# turning away as her temporary firmness forsook her there is a stain upon my #name# which the world visits on innocent #head#
the prospect before you answered $miss_rose$ firmly is a brilliant #one# i will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest alone on me
if i had been less less fortunate the world would call it if some obscure and peaceful #life# had been my destiny if i had been poor sick helpless would you have turned from me then
or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth do not press me to reply answered $miss_rose$
#one# #word# more $miss_rose$ dearest $miss_rose$ #one# more cried $harry_maylie$ throwing himself before her the question does not arise and never will
if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is retorted $harry_maylie$ it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely #way# and #light# the path before me
it is not an idle #thing# to do so much by the utterance of a few brief #word# for #one# who loves you beyond all else
oh $miss_rose$ in the #name# of my ardent and enduring attachment in the #name# of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo answer me this #one# question
then if your lot had been differently cast rejoined $miss_rose$ if you had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i should have been spared this trial
it is unfair almost unkind to urge it i have every reason to be happy very happy now but then $harry_maylie$ i own i should have been happier
busy recollections of old hopes cherished as a #girl# long ago crowded into the #mind# of $miss_rose$ while making this avowal but they brought #tear# with them as old hopes will when they come back withered and they relieved her
i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger said $miss_rose$ extending her #hand# i must leave you now indeed
once and only once more say within a #year# but it may be much sooner i may speak to you again on this subject for the last #time#
i ask #one# promise said $harry_maylie$ not to press me to alter my right determination replied $miss_rose$ with a melancholy smile it will be useless
i will lay at your #foot# whatever of station of fortune i may possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not seek by #word# or act to change it
then let it be so rejoined $miss_rose$ it is but #one# pang the more and by that #time# i may be enabled to bear it better
but the young #man# caught her to his bosom and imprinting #one# kiss on her beautiful forehead hurried from the #room#
no said $harry_maylie$ to hear you repeat it if you will finally repeat it she extended her #hand# again #chapter# xxxvi is a very short #one# and may appear of no great importance in its #place#
but it should be read notwithstanding as a sequel to the last and a key to #one# that will follow when its #time# arrives
and so you are resolved to be my travelling #companion# this #morning# eh said the #doctor# as $harry_maylie$ joined him and $oliver_twist$ at the breakfast #table#
why you are not in the same #mind# or intention two half #hour# together you will tell me a different tale #one# of these #day# said $harry_maylie$ colouring without any perceptible reason
i hope i may have good cause to do so replied $mr_losberne$ though i confess i dont think i shall
but yesterday #morning# you had made up your #mind# in a great hurry to stay here and to accompany your #mother# like a dutiful son to the sea #side#
before noon you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go on your road to london
and at #night# you urge me with great mystery to start before the #lady# are stirring the consequence of which is that young $oliver_twist$ here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds
too bad isnt it $oliver_twist$ i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away #sir# rejoined $oliver_twist$
but to speak seriously $harry_maylie$ has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your #part# to be gone
the great nobs replied $harry_maylie$ under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this #time# of the #year#
that a fine fellow said the #doctor# you shall come and see me when you return is it likely that #anything# would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them
but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political #life#
well said the #doctor# you are a queer fellow there #something# in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for #place# cup or sweepstakes
$harry_maylie$ looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by #one# or two remarks that would have staggered the #doctor# not a little but he contented himself with saying we shall see and pursued the subject no farther
the post chaise drove up to the #door# shortly afterwards and $mr_giles$ coming in for the luggage the good #doctor# bustled out to see it packed
$oliver_twist$ walked into the #window# recess to which mr maylie beckoned him much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits which his whole behaviour displayed
$oliver_twist$ said $harry_maylie$ in a low #voice# let me speak a #word# with you you can write well now said $harry_maylie$ laying his #hand# upon his #arm#
i hope so #sir# replied $oliver_twist$ i shall not be at home again perhaps for some #time# i wish you would write to me say once
a fort #night# every alternate monday to the general post office in london will you oh certainly #sir# i shall be proud to do it exclaimed $oliver_twist$ greatly delighted with the commission
i should like to know how how my #mother# and $miss_maylie$ are said the young #man# and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take and what you talk about and whether she they i mean seem happy and quite well
i would rather you did not mention it to them said $harry_maylie$ hurrying over his #word# because it might make my #mother# anxious to write to me oftener and it is a trouble and worry to her
you understand me oh quite #sir# quite replied $oliver_twist$ let it be a secret between you and me and #mind# you tell me everything
$oliver_twist$ quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications
the #doctor# was in the chaise $mr_giles$ who it had been arranged should be left behind held the #door# open in his #hand# and the #woman# servants were in the garden looking on
i depend upon you mr maylie took leave of him with many assurances of his regard and protection $harry_maylie$ cast #one# slight glance at the latticed #window# and jumped into the carriage
halloa cried the #doctor# letting down the front glass in a great hurry and shouting to the postillion #something# very short of flying will keep pace with me
drive on he cried hard fast full gallop #nothing# short of flying will keep pace with me to #day# do you hear
jingling and clattering till distance rendered its noise inaudible and its rapid progress only perceptible to the #eye# the vehicle wound its #way# along the road almost hidden in a cloud of dust now wholly disappearing and now becoming visible again as intervening objects or the intricacies of the #way# permitted
and there was #one# looker on who remained with #eye# fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared long after it was many miles away for behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when $harry_maylie$ raised his #eye# towards the #window# sat $miss_rose$ herself
it was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen that the gazers dispersed he seems in high spirits and happy she said at #length#
#tear# are signs of gladness as well as grief but those which coursed down $miss_rose$ #face# as she sat pensively at the #window# still gazing in the same direction seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy
i feared for a #time# he might be otherwise i was mistaken i am very very glad #chapter# xxxvii in which the reader may perceive a contrast
$mr_bumble$ sat in the workhouse parlour with his #eye# moodily fixed on the cheerless grate whence as it was summer #time# no brighter gleam proceeded than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun which were sent back from its cold and shining surface
a paper fly cage dangled from the ceiling to which he occasionally raised his #eye# in gloomy #thought# and as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net work $mr_bumble$ would heave a deep sigh while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance
$mr_bumble$ was meditating it might be that the insects brought to #mind# some painful passage in his own past #life#
not uncommon in matrimonial cases nor was $mr_bumble$ gloom the only #thing# calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator
there were not wanting other appearances and those closely connected with his own #person# which announced that a great change had taken #place# in the position of his affairs
the laced coat and the cocked #hat# where were they he still wore knee breeches and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs but they were not the breeches
the coat was wide skirted and in that respect like the coat but oh how different the mighty cocked #hat# was replaced by a modest round #one#
there are some promotions in #life# which independent of the more substantial rewards they offer require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them
$mr_bumble$ was no longer a #beadle# a field marshal has his uniform a bishop his silk apron a counsellor his silk gown
a #beadle# his cocked #hat# strip the bishop of his apron or the #beadle# of his #hat# and lace what are they
#man# mere #man# dignity and even holiness too sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some #people# imagine $mr_bumble$ had married $mrs_corney$ and was #master# of the workhouse
another #beadle# had come into power on him the cocked #hat# gold laced coat and staff had all three descended and to morrow two months it was done said $mr_bumble$ with a sigh
$mr_bumble$ might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks but the sigh there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh
i sold myself said $mr_bumble$ pursuing the same train of relection for six teaspoons a pair of sugar tongs and a milk pot with a small quantity of second #hand# furniture and twenty pound in money
cheap cried a shrill #voice# in $mr_bumble$ ear you would have been #dear# at any price and #dear# enough i paid for you lord above knows that
$mr_bumble$ turned and encountered the #face# of his interesting consort who imperfectly comprehending the few #word# she had overheard of his complaint had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture
it seems a age i went very reasonable cheap dirt cheap mrs $mr_bumble$ ma am said $mr_bumble$ with a sentimental sternness
well cried the #lady# have the goodness to #look# at me said $mr_bumble$ fixing his #eye# upon her
if she stands such a #eye# as that said $mr_bumble$ to himself she can stand #anything# it is a #eye# i never knew to fail with paupers
whether an exceedingly small expansion of #eye# be sufficient to quell paupers who being lightly fed are in no very high condition or whether the late $mrs_corney$ was particularly proof against eagle glances are #matter# of opinion
the #matter# of fact is that the #matron# was in no #way# overpowered by $mr_bumble$ scowl but on the contrary treated it with great disdain and even raised a laugh thereat which sounded as though it were genuine
if it fails with her my power is gone on hearing this most unexpected sound $mr_bumble$ looked first incredulous and afterwards amazed
he then relapsed into his former state nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the #voice# of his partner
i am going to sit here as long as i think proper ma am rejoined $mr_bumble$ and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me such being my prerogative
are you going to sit snoring there all #day# inquired mrs $mr_bumble$ your prerogative sneered mrs $mr_bumble$ with ineffable contempt
i said the #word# ma am said $mr_bumble$ the prerogative of a #man# is to command and what the prerogative of a #woman# in the #name# of goodness cried the relict of mr $mrs_corney$ deceased
to obey ma am thundered $mr_bumble$ your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive now
mrs $mr_bumble$ seeing at a glance that the decisive #moment# had now arrived and that a blow struck for the mastership on #one# #side# or other must necessarily be final and conclusive no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone than she dropped into a #chair# and with a loud scream that $mr_bumble$ was a hard hearted brute fell into a paroxysm of #tear#
i wish he was poor #man# but #tear# were not the #thing# to find their #way# to $mr_bumble$ soul his #heart# was waterproof
like washable beaver #hat# that improve with rain his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous by showers of #tear# which being tokens of weakness and so far tacit admissions of his own power pleased and exalted him
he eyed his good #lady# with #look# of great satisfaction and begged in an encouraging #manner# that she should cry her hardest the exercise being looked upon by the faculty as strongly conducive to health
it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the #eye# and softens down the temper said $mr_bumble$ so cry away
as he discharged himself of this pleasantry $mr_bumble$ took his #hat# from a peg and putting it on rather rakishly on #one# #side# as a #man# might who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming #manner# thrust his #hand# into his #pocket# and sauntered towards the #door# with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance
now $mrs_corney$ that was had tried the #tear# because they were less troublesome than a manual assault but she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding as $mr_bumble$ was not long in discovering
the first proof he experienced of the fact was conveyed in a hollow sound immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his #hat# to the opposite end of the #room#
this preliminary proceeding laying bare his #head# the expert #lady# clasping him tightly round the throat with #one# #hand# inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and dexterity upon it with the other
this done she created a little variety by scratching his #face# and tearing his hair and having by this #time# inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence she pushed him over a #chair# which was luckily well situated for the purpose and defied him to talk about his prerogative again if he dared
get up said mrs $mr_bumble$ in a #voice# of command and take yourself away from here unless you want me to do #something# desperate
$mr_bumble$ $miss_rose$ with a very rueful countenance wondering much what #something# desperate might be picking up his #hat# he looked towards the #door#
are you going demanded mrs $mr_bumble$ certainly my #dear# certainly rejoined $mr_bumble$ making a quicker motion towards the #door#
you are so very violent that really i at this instant mrs $mr_bumble$ stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet which had been kicked up in the scuffle
$mr_bumble$ immediately darted out of the #room# without bestowing another #thought# on his unfinished sentence leaving the late $mrs_corney$ in full possession of the field
he had a decided propensity for bullying derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty and consequently was it is needless to say a coward
this is by no means a disparagement to his character for many official personages who are held in high respect and admiration are the victims of similar infirmities
the remark is made indeed rather in his favour than otherwise and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office
i didnt intend to i going my #dear# $mr_bumble$ was fairly taken by surprise and fairly beaten but the measure of his degradation was not yet full
after making a tour of the #house# and thinking for the first #time# that the poor laws really were too hard on #people# and that #man# who ran away from their wives leaving them chargeable to the parish ought in justice to be visited with no punishment at all but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much $mr_bumble$ came to a #room# where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen when the sound of #voice# in conversation now proceeded
hem said $mr_bumble$ summoning up all his native dignity these #woman# at least shall continue to respect the prerogative
with these #word# $mr_bumble$ opened the #door# and walked in with a very fierce and angry #manner# which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering #air# as his #eye# unexpectedly rested on the form of his #lady# wife
hallo hallo there what do you mean by this noise you hussies my #dear# said $mr_bumble$ i didnt know you were here
i #thought# they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly my #dear# replied $mr_bumble$ glancing distractedly at a couple of old #woman# at the wash tub who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse #master# humility
didnt know i was here repeated mrs $mr_bumble$ what do you do here you #thought# they were talking too much said mrs $mr_bumble$
what business is it of yours why my #dear# urged $mr_bumble$ submissively what business is it of yours demanded mrs $mr_bumble$ again
it very true you re #matron# here my #dear# submitted $mr_bumble$ but i #thought# you mightnt be in the #way# just then
you re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into #thing# that dont concern you making everybody in the #house# laugh the #moment# your back is turned and making yourself #look# like a fool every #hour# in the #day#
$mr_bumble$ seeing with excruciating feelings the delight of the two old paupers who were tittering together most rapturously hesitated for an instant
mrs $mr_bumble$ whose patience brooked no delay caught up a bowl of soap suds and motioning him towards the #door# ordered him instantly to depart on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly #person#
i ll tell you what $mr_bumble$ returned his #lady# we dont want any of your interference be off come what could $mr_bumble$ do
he looked dejectedly round and slunk away and as he reached the #door# the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight
he was degraded in their #eye# he had lost caste and station before the very paupers he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen peckery
no more than two months ago i was not only my own #master# but everybody else so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned and now it was too much
$mr_bumble$ boxed the ears of the #boy# who opened the gate for him for he had reached the portal in his reverie and walked distractedly into the #street#
he walked up #one# #street# and down another until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty
he passed a great many public #house# but at #length# paused before #one# in a by #way# whose parlour as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds was deserted save by #one# solitary customer
it wanted but this all in two months said $mr_bumble$ filled with dismal #thought# two months it began to rain heavily at the #moment#
$mr_bumble$ stepped in and ordering #something# to drink as he passed the bar entered the apartment into which he had looked from the #street#
he had the #air# of a stranger and seemed by a certain haggardness in his #look# as well as by the dusty soils on his dress to have travelled some distance
this determined him the #man# who was seated there was tall and dark and wore a large cloak he eyed $mr_bumble$ askance as he entered but scarcely deigned to nod his #head# in acknowledgment of his salutation
$mr_bumble$ had quite dignity enough for two supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar so he drank his gin and #water# in #silence# and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance
it so happened however as it will happen very often when #man# fall into company under such circumstances that $mr_bumble$ felt every now and then a powerful inducement which he could not resist to steal a #look# at the stranger and that whenever he did so he withdrew his #eye# in some confusion to find that the stranger was at that #moment# stealing a #look# at him
$mr_bumble$ awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger #eye# which was keen and bright but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion unlike #anything# he had ever observed before and repulsive to behold
when they had encountered each other glance several #time# in this #way# the stranger in a harsh deep #voice# broke #silence#
were you looking for me he said when you peered in at the #window# not that i am aware of unless you re mr
here $mr_bumble$ stopped short for he was curious to know the stranger #name# and #thought# in his impatience he might supply the blank
i see you were not said the stranger an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth or you have known my #name#
you dont know it i would recommend you not to ask for it i meant no harm young #man# observed $mr_bumble$ majestically
and have done none said the stranger another #silence# succeeded this short dialogue which was again broken by the stranger
you were differently dressed at that #time# and i only passed you in the #street# but i should know you again
i have seen you before i think said he you were #beadle# here once were you not i was said $mr_bumble$ in some surprise porochial #beadle#
just so rejoined the other nodding his #head# it was in that character i saw you what are you now
#master# of the workhouse rejoined $mr_bumble$ slowly and impressively to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume
you have the same #eye# to your own interest that you always had i doubt not resumed the stranger looking keenly into $mr_bumble$ #eye# as he raised them in astonishment at the question
#master# of the workhouse young #man# dont scruple to answer freely #man# i know you pretty well you see
i suppose a married #man# replied $mr_bumble$ shading his #eye# with his #hand# and surveying the stranger from #head# to #foot# in evident perplexity is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single #one#
porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper #manner#
the stranger smiled and nodded his #head# again as much to say he had not mistaken his #man# then rang the bell
fill this glass again he said handing $mr_bumble$ empty tumbler to the landlord let it be strong and hot
you like it so i suppose not too strong replied $mr_bumble$ with a delicate cough you understand what that means landlord said the stranger drily
the host smiled disappeared and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum of which the first gulp brought the #water# into $mr_bumble$ #eye#
i came down to this #place# to #day# to find you out and by #one# of those chances which the devil throws in the #way# of his #friend# sometimes you walked into the very #room# i was sitting in while you were uppermost in my #mind#
now listen to me said the stranger after closing the #door# and #window# i want some information from you i dont ask you to give it for #nothing# slight as it is
as he spoke he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the #table# to his #companion# carefully as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without
when $mr_bumble$ had scrupulously examined the coins to see that they were genuine and had put them up with much satisfaction in his waistcoat #pocket# he went on carry your memory back let me see twelve #year# last winter
put up that to begin with it a long #time# said $mr_bumble$ very good i ve done it
and the #place# the crazy hole wherever it was in which miserable drabs brought forth the #life# and health so often denied to themselves gave birth to puling #child# for the parish to rear and hid their shame rot em in the grave
the scene the workhouse good and the #time# #night# yes the lying in #room# i suppose said $mr_bumble$ not quite following the stranger excited description
yes said the stranger a #boy# was born there a many #boy# observed $mr_bumble$ shaking his #head# despondingly
a murrain on the young devils cried the stranger i speak of #one# a meek looking pale faced #boy# who was apprenticed down here to a coffin maker i wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in it and who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed
why you mean $oliver_twist$ young twist said $mr_bumble$ i remember him of course there wasnt a obstinater young rascal
it not of him i want to hear i ve heard enough of him said the stranger stopping $mr_bumble$ in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor $oliver_twist$ vices
it of a #woman# the hag that nursed his #mother# where is she where is she said $mr_bumble$ whom the gin and #water# had rendered facetious
it would be hard to tell there no midwifery there whichever #place# she gone to so i suppose she out of employment anyway
the #man# looked fixedly at him when he had given this information and although he did not withdraw his #eye# for some #time# afterwards his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted and he seemed lost in #thought#
for some #time# he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence but at #length# he breathed more freely and withdrawing his #eye# observed that it was no great #matter#
what do you mean demanded the stranger sternly that she died last winter rejoined $mr_bumble$ with that he $miss_rose$ as if to depart
but $mr_bumble$ was cunning enough and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half
he well remembered the #night# of old sally #death# which the occurrences of that #day# had given him good reason to recollect as the occasion on which he had proposed to $mrs_corney$ and although that #lady# had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness he had heard enough to know that it related to #something# that had occurred in the old #woman# attendance as workhouse nurse upon the young #mother# of $oliver_twist$
hastily calling this circumstance to #mind# he informed the stranger with an #air# of mystery that #one# #woman# had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died and that she could as he had reason to believe throw some #light# on the subject of his inquiry
how can i find her said the stranger thrown off his guard and plainly showing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused afresh by the intelligence
at nine in the evening said the stranger producing a scrap of paper and writing down upon it an obscure address by the #water# #side# in characters that betrayed his agitation at nine in the evening bring her to me there
only through me rejoined $mr_bumble$ when cried the stranger hastily to morrow rejoined $mr_bumble$ i neednt tell you to be secret
with these #word# he led the #way# to the #door# after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk
shortly remarking that their roads were different he departed without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the #hour# of appointment for the following #night#
it your interest on glancing at the address the parochial functionary observed that it contained no #name# the stranger had not gone far so he made after him to ask it
what do you want cried the #man# turning quickly round as $mr_bumble$ touched him on the #arm# following me only to ask a question said the other pointing to the scrap of paper
what #name# am i to ask for monks rejoined the #man# and strode hastily away #chapter# xxxviii containing an account of what passed between mr
the clouds which had been threatening all #day# spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour already yielded large drops of rain and seemed to presage a violent thunder storm when mr and mrs $mr_bumble$ turning out of the main #street# of the town directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous #house# distant from it some mile and a half or thereabouts and erected on a low unwholesome swamp bordering upon the river
they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments which might perhaps serve the double purpose of protecting their #person# from the rain and sheltering them from observation
the husband carried a lantern from which however no #light# yet shone and trudged on a few paces in front as though the #way# being dirty to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints
they went on in profound #silence# every now and then $mr_bumble$ relaxed his pace and turned his #head# as if to make sure that his helpmate was following then discovering that she was close at his heels he mended his rate of walking and proceeded at a considerable increase of speed towards their #place# of destination
this was far from being a #place# of doubtful character for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians who under various pretences of living by their labour subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime
it was a collection of mere hovels some hastily built with loose bricks others of old worm eaten ship timber jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement and planted for the most #part# within a few #foot# of the river bank
a few leaky boats drawn up on the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it and here and there an oar or coil of rope appeared at first to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a passer by without much difficulty to the conjecture that they were disposed there rather for the preservation of appearances than with any view to their being actually employed
in the #heart# of this cluster of huts and skirting the river which its upper stories overhung stood a large building formerly used as a manufactory of some kind
and mrs $mr_bumble$ and mr monks at their nocturnal interview it was a dull close overcast summer evening it had in its #day# probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements
the rat the worm and the action of the damp had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the #water# while the remainder tottering and bending over the dark stream seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old #companion# and involving itself in the same fate
it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the #air# and the rain commenced pouring violently down
but it had long since gone to ruin the #place# should be somewhere here said $mr_bumble$ consulting a scrap of paper he held in his #hand#
following the sound $mr_bumble$ raised his #head# and descried a #man# looking out of a #door# breast high on the second story
halloa there cried a #voice# from above stand still a #minute# cried the #voice# i ll be with you directly with which the #head# disappeared and the #door# closed
then #mind# what i told you said the #matron# and be careful to say as little as you can or you ll betray us at once
$mr_bumble$ who had eyed the building with very rueful #look# was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then when he was prevented by the appearance of monks who opened a small #door# near which they stood and beckoned them inwards
is that the #man# asked $mr_bumble$ good #lady# $mr_bumble$ nodded in the affirmative come in he cried impatiently stamping his #foot# upon the #ground#
$mr_bumble$ who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind followed obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic
what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet said monks turning round and addressing $mr_bumble$ after he had bolted the #door# behind them
dont keep me here the #woman# who had hesitated at first walked boldly in without any other invitation we we were only cooling ourselves stammered $mr_bumble$ looking apprehensively about him
not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hell #fire# out as a #man# can carry about with him
with this agreeable speech monks turned short upon the #matron# and bent his gaze upon her till even she who was not easily cowed was fain to withdraw her #eye# and turn them towards the #ground#
cooling yourselves retorted monks you wont cool yourself so easily dont think it this is the #woman# is it demanded monks
you think #woman# never can keep secrets i suppose said the #matron# interposing and returning as she spoke the searching #look# of monks
hem that is the #woman# replied $mr_bumble$ mindful of his wife caution i know they will always keep #one# till it found out said monks
so by the same rule if a #woman# a party to a secret that might hang or transport her i not afraid of her telling it to anybody not i
and what may that be asked the #matron# the loss of their own good #name# replied monks do you understand mistress
bestowing #something# half #way# between a smile and a frown upon his two #companion# and again beckoning them to follow him the #man# hastened across the apartment which was of considerable extent but low in the roof
he was preparing to ascend a steep staircase or rather ladder leading to another floor of warehouses above when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture and a peal of thunder followed which shook the crazy building to its centre
no rejoined the #matron# slightly colouring as she spoke of course you dont said monks how should you hear it
he cried shrinking back hear it rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it
he remained silent for a few #moment# and then removing his #hand# suddenly from his #face# showed to the unspeakable discomposure of $mr_bumble$ that it was much distorted and discoloured
i hate the sound these fits come over me now and then said monks observing his alarm and thunder sometimes brings them on
thus speaking he led the #way# up the ladder and hastily closing the #window# shutter of the #room# into which it led lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through #one# of the heavy beams in the ceiling and which cast a dim #light# upon an old #table# and three #chair# that were placed beneath it
now said monks when they had all three seated themselves the sooner we come to our business the better for all
the question was addressed to $mr_bumble$ but his wife anticipated the reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it
he is right in saying that you were with this hag the #night# she died and that she told you #something# about the #mother# of the #boy# you named replied the #matron# interrupting him
dont #mind# me now it all over for this once the #woman# know what it is does she yes the first question is of what nature was her communication said monks
that the second observed the #woman# with much deliberation the first is what may the communication be worth who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is asked monks
nobody better than you i am persuaded answered mrs $mr_bumble$ who did not want for spirit as her yoke fellow could abundantly testify
humph said monks significantly and with a #look# of eager inquiry there may be money worth to get eh perhaps there may was the composed reply
#something# that was taken from her said monks #something# that she wore #something# that you had better bid interrupted mrs $mr_bumble$
$mr_bumble$ who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended #eye# which he directed towards his wife and monks by turns in undisguised astonishment increased if possible when the latter sternly demanded what sum was required for the disclosure
i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the #man# i ought to talk to what it worth to you asked the #woman# as collectedly as before
add five pounds to the sum you have named give me five and twenty pounds in gold said the #woman# and i ll tell you all i know
it may be #nothing# it may be twenty pounds replied monks speak out and let me know which not before five and twenty pounds exclaimed monks drawing back
it not a large sum either not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be #nothing# when it told
i spoke as plainly as i could replied mrs $mr_bumble$ cried monks impatiently and which has been lying dead for twelve #year# past or more
such #matter# keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of #time# answered the #matron# still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed
as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand #year# to come or twelve million for #anything# you
or i know who will tell strange tales at last what if i pay it for #nothing# asked monks hesitating
not alone my #dear# nor unprotected neither submitted $mr_bumble$ in a #voice# tremulous with fear i am here my #dear#
and besides said $mr_bumble$ his teeth chattering as he spoke mr monks is too much of a #gentleman# to attempt any violence on porochial #person#
you can easily take it away again replied the #matron# i am but a #woman# alone here and unprotected mr monks is aware that i am not a young #man# my #dear# and
bu he has heerd i say i have no doubt mr monks has heerd my #dear# that i am a very determined officer with very uncommon strength if i once roused
also that i am a little run to seed as i may say i only want a little rousing that all
as $mr_bumble$ spoke he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination and plainly showed by the alarmed expression of every feature that he did want a little rousing and not a little prior to making any very warlike demonstration unless indeed against paupers or other #person# or #person# trained down for the purpose
he had better have cut it out before he came if he cant speak in a lower tone said monks grimly
you are a fool said mrs $mr_bumble$ in reply and had better hold your tongue so he your husband eh
i #thought# as much when you came in rejoined monks marking the angry glance which the #lady# darted at her spouse as she spoke
so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two #people# when i find that there only #one# will between them
he thrust his #hand# into a #side# #pocket# and producing a canvas bag told out twenty five sovereigns on the #table# and pushed them over to the #woman#
now he said gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder which i feel is coming up to break over the #house# top is gone let hear your story
the thunder which seemed in fact much nearer and to shiver and break almost over their #head# having subsided monks raising his #face# from the #table# bent forward to listen to what the #woman# should say
the #face# of the three nearly touched as the two #man# leant over the small #table# in their eagerness to hear and the #woman# also leant forward to render her whisper audible
the sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances which encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness looked ghastly in the extreme
he my husband tittered the #matron# parrying the question i in earnest see here when this #woman# that we called old sally died the #matron# began she and i were alone
was there no #one# by asked monks in the same hollow whisper no sick wretch or idiot in some other #bed#
no #one# who could hear and might by possibility understand not a soul replied the #woman# we were alone i stood alone beside the body when #death# came over it
she spoke of a young creature resumed the #matron# who had brought a #child# into the world some #year# before not merely in the same #room# but in the same #bed# in which she then lay dying
good said monks regarding her attentively go on ay said monks with quivering lip and glancing over his shoulder blood
the #child# was the #one# you named to him last #night# said the #matron# nodding carelessly towards her husband the #mother# this nurse had robbed
how #thing# come about in #life# asked monks in #death# replied the #woman# with #something# like a shudder
she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to #one# that which the dead #mother# had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infant sake
how long before as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this said the #matron# she fell back and died
she sold it cried monks with desperate eagerness did she sell it where when to whom without saying more cried monks in a #voice# which from its very suppression seemed only the more furious
it a lie i ll not be played with she said more i ll #tear# the #life# out of you both but i ll know what it was
she didnt utter another #word# said the #woman# to all appearance unmoved as $mr_bumble$ was very far from being by the strange #man# violence but she clutched my gown violently with #one# #hand# which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the #hand# by force
i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper which contained interposed monks stretching forward #nothing# replied the #woman# it was a pawnbroker duplicate
i judge that she had kept the trinket for some #time# in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker interest #year# by #year# and prevent its running out so that if #anything# came of it it could still be redeemed
#nothing# had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her #hand#
the #time# was out in two #day# i #thought# #something# might #one# #day# come of it too and so redeemed the pledge
for what demanded monks in good #time# i ll tell you said the #woman# where is it now asked monks quickly
and as if glad to be relieved of it she hastily threw upon the #table# a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a french watch which monks pouncing upon tore open with trembling #hand#
there replied the #woman# it contained a little gold locket in which were two locks of hair and a plain gold wedding ring
there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a #year# before the #child# was born
it has the #word# agnes engraved on the inside said the #woman# i found out that and this is all said monks after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet
$mr_bumble$ drew a long breath as if he were glad to find that the story was over and no mention made of taking the five and twenty pounds back again and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose unchecked during the whole of the previous dialogue
i know #nothing# of the story beyond what i can guess at said his wife addressing monks after a short #silence# and
all replied the #woman# i want to know #nothing# for it safer not but i may ask you two questions may i
you may ask said monks with some show of surprise but whether i answer or not is another question which makes three observed $mr_bumble$ essaying a stroke of facetiousness
is that what you expected to get from me demanded the #matron# it is replied monks the other question what do you propose to do with it
can it be used against me never rejoined monks nor against me either see here but dont move a step forward or your #life# is not worth a bulrush
with these #word# he suddenly wheeled the #table# aside and pulling an iron ring in the boarding threw back a large trap #door# which opened close at $mr_bumble$ #foot# and caused that #gentleman# to retire several paces backward with great precipitation
#look# down said monks lowering the lantern into the gulf dont fear me i could have let you down quietly enough when you were seated over it if that had been my game
thus encouraged the #matron# drew near to the brink and even $mr_bumble$ himself impelled by curiousity ventured to do the same
the turbid #water# swollen by the heavy rain was rushing rapidly on below and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles
there had once been a #water# mill beneath the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes and fragments of machinery that yet remained seemed to dart onward with a new impulse when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course
if you flung a #man# body down there where would it be to morrow #morning# said monks swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well
monks drew the little packet from his breast where he had hurriedly thrust it and tying it to a leaden weight which had formed a #part# of some pulley and was lying on the floor dropped it into the stream
twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides replied $mr_bumble$ recoiling at the #thought# it fell straight and true as a die clove the #water# with a scarcely audible splash and was gone
the three looking into each other #face# seemed to breathe more freely there said monks closing the trap #door# which fell heavily back into its former position
if the sea ever gives up its dead as #book# say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash among it
we have #nothing# more to say and may break up our pleasant party by all means observed $mr_bumble$ with great alacrity
i am not afraid of your wife you may depend upon me young #man# answered $mr_bumble$ bowing himself gradually towards the ladder with excessive politeness
you ll keep a quiet tongue in your #head# will you said monks with a threatening #look# on everybody account young #man# on my own you know mr monks
i am glad for your sake to hear it remarked monks #light# your lantern and get away from here as fast as you can
it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point or $mr_bumble$ who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder would infallibly have pitched headlong into the #room# below
he lighted his lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope and now carried in his #hand# and making no effort to prolong the discourse descended in #silence# followed by his wife
monks brought up the rear after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the rushing of the #water#
they traversed the lower #room# slowly and with caution for monks started at every shadow and $mr_bumble$ holding his lantern a #foot# above the #ground# walked not only with remarkable care but with a marvellously #light# step for a #gentleman# of his figure looking nervously about him for hidden trap #door#
the gate at which they had entered was softly unfastened and opened by monks merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside
they were no sooner gone than monks who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone called to a #boy# who had been hidden somewhere below
bidding him go first and bear the #light# he returned to the chamber he had just quitted #chapter# xxxix introduces some respectable characters
on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last #chapter# disposed of their little #matter# of business as therein narrated $mr_william_sikes$ awakening from a nap drowsily growled forth an inquiry what #time# of #night# it was
the #room# in which $mr_william_sikes$ propounded this question was not #one# of those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings
it was not in appearance so desirable a habitation as his old quarters being a mean and badly furnished apartment of very limited size lighted only by #one# small #window# in the shelving roof and abutting on a close and dirty lane
nor were there wanting other indications of the good #gentleman# having gone down in the world of late for a great scarcity of furniture and total absence of comfort together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen bespoke a state of extreme poverty while the meagre and attenuated condition of $mr_william_sikes$ himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms if they had stood in any need of corroboration
the housebreaker was lying on the #bed# wrapped in his white great coat by #way# of dressing gown and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness and the addition of a soiled nightcap and a stiff black beard of a week growth
the #dog# sat at the bedside now eyeing his #master# with a wistful #look# and now pricking his ears and uttering a low growl as some noise in the #street# or in the lower #part# of the #house# attracted his attention
seated by the #window# busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber ordinary dress was a female so pale and reduced with watching and privation that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same $miss_nancy$ who has already figured in this tale but for the #voice# in which she replied to $mr_william_sikes$ question
with whom the reader is already acquainted and shows how monks and the jew laid their worthy #head# together not long gone seven said the #girl#
how do you feel to #night# $bill_sikes$ as weak as #water# replied $mr_william_sikes$ with an imprecation on his #eye# and limbs
illness had not improved $mr_william_sikes$ temper for as the #girl# raised him up and led him to a #chair# he muttered various curses on her awkwardness and struck her
here lend us a #hand# and let me get off this thundering #bed# anyhow whining are you said $mr_william_sikes$ come
dont stand snivelling there if you cant do #anything# better than that cut off altogether ye hear me i hear you replied the #girl# turning her #face# aside and forcing a laugh
what fancy have you got in your #head# now oh you ve #thought# better of it have you growled $mr_william_sikes$ marking the #tear# which trembled in her #eye#
why you dont mean to say you be hard upon me to #night# $bill_sikes$ said the #girl# laying her #hand# upon his shoulder
such a number of #night# said the #girl# with a touch of #woman# tenderness which communicated #something# like sweetness of tone even to her #voice# such a number of #night# as i ve been patient with you nursing and caring for you as if you had been a #child# and this the first that i ve seen you like yourself you wouldnt have served me as you did just now if you #thought# of that would you
all the better for you you have no cried $mr_william_sikes$ why not come come say you wouldnt
well then rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ i wouldnt why damme now the #girl# whining again it #nothing# said the #girl# throwing herself into a #chair#
dont you seem to #mind# me it ll soon be over what ll be over demanded $mr_william_sikes$ in a savage #voice#
what foolery are you up to now again get up and bustle about and dont come over me with your #woman# nonsense
at any other #time# this remonstrance and the tone in which it was delivered would have had the desired effect but the #girl# being really weak and exhausted dropped her #head# over the back of the #chair# and fainted before $mr_william_sikes$ could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his threats
not knowing very well what to do in this uncommon emergency for $miss_nancy$ hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of without much assistance $mr_william_sikes$ tried a little blasphemy and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual called for assistance
what the #matter# here my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ looking in lend a #hand# to the #girl# cant you replied $mr_william_sikes$ impatiently
with an exclamation of surprise $mr_fagin$ hastened to the #girl# assistance while $mr_john_dawkins$ otherwise the artful dodger who had followed his venerable #friend# into the #room# hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden and snatching a bottle from the grasp of #master# charles $charley_bates$ who came close at his heels uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth and poured a portion of its contents down the patient throat previously taking a taste himself to prevent mistakes
give her a whiff of fresh #air# with the bellows $charley_bates$ said $mr_john_dawkins$ and you slap her #hand# $mr_fagin$ while $bill_sikes$ undoes the petticuts
these united restoratives administered with great energy especially that department consigned to #master# $charley_bates$ who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings a piece of unexampled pleasantry were not long in producing the desired effect
the #girl# gradually recovered her senses and staggering to a #chair# by the bedside hid her #face# upon the pillow leaving $mr_william_sikes$ to confront the new comers in some astonishment at their unlooked for appearance
no evil wind at all my #dear# for evil winds blow nobody any good and i ve brought #something# good with me that you ll be glad to see
dodger my #dear# open the bundle and give $bill_sikes$ the little trifles that we spent all our money on this #morning#
in compliance with $mr_fagin$ request the artful untied this bundle which was of large size and formed of an old #table# cloth and handed the articles it contained #one# by #one# to $charley_bates$ who placed them on the #table# with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence
sitch a rabbit pie $bill_sikes$ exclaimed that young #gentleman# disclosing to view a huge pasty sitch delicate creeturs with sitch tender limbs $bill_sikes$ that the wery bones melt in your mouth and there no occasion to pick em
half a pound of seven and six penny green so precious strong that if you mix it with biling #water# it ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea pot off
a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didnt work at all at afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness oh no
two half quartern brans pound of best fresh piece of double glo ster and to wind up all some of the richest sort you ever lushed
uttering this last panegyric #master# $charley_bates$ produced from #one# of his extensive #pocket# a full sized wine bottle carefully corked while $mr_john_dawkins$ at the same instant poured out a wine glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried which the invalid tossed down his throat without a #moment# hesitation
dont stand chattering and grinning at me why what evil wind has blowed you here he asked $mr_fagin$ ah said $mr_fagin$ rubbing his #hand# with great satisfaction
do exclaimed $mr_william_sikes$ i might have been done for twenty #time# over afore you have done #anything# to help me
you ll do $bill_sikes$ you ll do now what do you mean by leaving a #man# in this state three weeks and more you false hearted wagabond
only hear him #boy# said $mr_fagin$ shrugging his shoulders and us come to bring him all these beau ti ful #thing#
the #thing# is well enough in their #way# observed $mr_william_sikes$ a little soothed as he glanced over the #table# but what have you got to say for yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health blunt and everything else and take no more notice of me all this mortal #time# than if i was that ere #dog# drive him down $charley_bates$
i never see such a jolly #dog# as that cried #master# $charley_bates$ doing as he was desired smelling the grub like a old #lady# a going to market
he make his fortun on the stage that #dog# would and rewive the drayma besides hold your din cried $mr_william_sikes$ as the #dog# retreated under the #bed# still growling angrily
what have you got to say for yourself you withered old fence eh i was away from london a week and more my #dear# on a plant replied the jew
and what about the other fortnight demanded $mr_william_sikes$ what about the other fortnight that you ve left me lying here like a sick rat in his hole
i couldnt help it $bill_sikes$ i cant go into a long explanation before company but i couldnt help it upon my honour
cut me off a piece of that pie #one# of you #boy# to take the taste of that out of my mouth or it ll choke me dead dont be out of temper my #dear# urged $mr_fagin$ submissively
upon your what growled $mr_william_sikes$ with excessive disgust here i have never forgot you $bill_sikes$ never once no i ll pound it that you hant replied $mr_william_sikes$ with a bitter grin
you ve been scheming and plotting away every #hour# that i have laid shivering and burning here and $bill_sikes$ was to do this and $bill_sikes$ was to do that and $bill_sikes$ was to do it all dirt cheap as soon as he got well and was quite poor enough for your work
if it hadnt been for the #girl# i might have died there now $bill_sikes$ remonstrated $mr_fagin$ eagerly catching at the #word#
if it hadnt been for the #girl# who but poor ould $mr_fagin$ was the means of your having such a handy #girl# about you
$miss_nancy$ appearance gave a new turn to the conversation for the #boy# receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with liquor of which however she took very sparingly while $mr_fagin$ assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought $mr_william_sikes$ into a better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter and moreover by laughing very heartily at #one# or two rough jokes which after repeated applications to the spirit bottle he condescended to make
he says true enough there said $miss_nancy$ coming hastily forward let him be let him be it all very well said $mr_william_sikes$
but i must have some blunt from you to #night# i havent a piece of coin about me replied the jew
then you ve got lots at home retorted $mr_william_sikes$ and i must have some from there lots cried $mr_fagin$ holding up is #hand#
i dont know how much you ve got and i dare say you hardly know yourself as it would take a pretty long #time# to count it said $mr_william_sikes$
i havent so much as would but i must have some to #night# and that flat well well said $mr_fagin$ with a sigh i ll send the artful round presently
the artful a deal too artful and would forget to come or lose his #way# or get dodged by traps and so be perwented or #anything# for an excuse if you put him up to it
$miss_nancy$ shall go to the ken and fetch it to make all sure and i ll lie down and have a snooze while she gone
after a great deal of haggling and squabbling $mr_fagin$ beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen pence to keep #house# with $mr_william_sikes$ sullenly remarking that if he couldnt get any more he must accompany him home with the dodger and #master# $charley_bates$ put the eatables in the cupboard
the jew then taking leave of his affectionate #friend# returned homeward attended by $miss_nancy$ and the #boy# $mr_william_sikes$ meanwhile flinging himself on the #bed# and composing himself to sleep away the #time# until the young #lady# return
in due course they arrived at $mr_fagin$ abode where they found $mr_toby_crackit$ and $mr_chitling$ intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter #gentleman# lost and with it his fifteenth and last sixpence much to the amusement of his young #friend#
$mr_toby_crackit$ apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a #gentleman# so much his inferior in station and mental endowments yawned and inquiring after $mr_william_sikes$ took up his #hat# to go
you wont do #nothing# of the kind rejoined $mr_william_sikes$ has nobody been $mr_toby_crackit$ asked $mr_fagin$ not a living leg answered $mr_toby_crackit$ pulling up his collar it been as dull as swipes
damme i as flat as a juryman and should have gone to sleep as fast as newgate if i hadnt had the good natur to amuse this youngster
you ought to stand #something# handsome $mr_fagin$ to recompense me for keeping #house# so long horrid dull i blessed if i ant
with these and other ejaculations of the same kind $mr_toby_crackit$ swept up his winnings and crammed them into his waistcoat #pocket# with a haughty #air# as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a #man# of his figure this done he swaggered out of the #room# with so much elegance and gentility that $mr_chitling$ bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview and that he didnt value his losses the snap of his little finger
wot a rum chap you are $tom_white$ said #master# $charley_bates$ highly amused by this declaration not a bit of it replied $mr_chitling$
am i $mr_fagin$ a very clever fellow my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ patting him on the shoulder and winking to his other pupils
and $mr_toby_crackit$ is a heavy swell ant he $mr_fagin$ asked $tom_white$ no doubt at all of that my #dear#
and it is a creditable #thing# to have his acquaintance ant it $mr_fagin$ pursued $tom_white$ very much so indeed my #dear#
they re only jealous $tom_white$ because he wont give it to them ah cried $tom_white$ triumphantly that where it is he has cleaned me out
but i can go and earn some more when i like cant i $mr_fagin$ to be sure you can and the sooner you go the better $tom_white$ so make up your loss at once and dont lose any more #time#
in obedience to this hint the #boy# nodding to $miss_nancy$ took up their #hat# and left the #room# the dodger and his vivacious #friend# indulging as they went in many witticisms at the expense of $mr_chitling$ in whose conduct it is but justice to say there was #nothing# very conspicuous or peculiar
inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town who pay a much higher price than $mr_chitling$ for being seen in good society and a great number of fine #gentleman# composing the good society aforesaid who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash $mr_toby_crackit$
dodger $charley_bates$ it #time# you were on the lay come it near ten and #nothing# done yet now said $mr_fagin$ when they had left the #room# i ll go and get you that cash $miss_nancy$
this is only the key of a little cupboard where i keep a few odd #thing# the #boy# get my #dear#
it a poor trade $miss_nancy$ and no thanks but i fond of seeing the young #people# about me and i bear it all i bear it all
i never lock up my money for i ve got none to lock up my #dear# ha ha ha none to lock up hush
the #girl# who was sitting at the #table# with her #arm# folded appeared in no #way# interested in the arrival or to care whether the #person# whoever he was came or went until the murmur of a #man# #voice# reached her ears
the instant she caught the sound she tore off her bonnet and shawl with the rapidity of lightning and thrust them under the #table#
the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered a complaint of the heat in a tone of languor that contrasted very remarkably with the extreme haste and violence of this action which however had been unobserved by $mr_fagin$ who had his back towards her at the #time#
he said hastily concealing the key in his breast who that listen bah he whispered as though nettled by the interruption it the #man# i expected before he coming downstairs
laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip the jew carried a candle to the #door# as a #man# step was heard upon the stairs without
he reached it at the same #moment# as the visitor who coming hastily into the #room# was close upon the #girl# before he observed her
not a #word# about the money while he here nance he wont stop long not ten #minute# my #dear# it was monks
only #one# of my young #people# said $mr_fagin$ observing that monks drew back on beholding a stranger dont move $miss_nancy$
the #girl# drew closer to the #table# and glancing at monks with an #air# of careless levity withdrew her #eye# but as he turned towards $mr_fagin$ she stole another #look# so keen and searching and full of purpose that if there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly have believed the two #look# to have proceeded from the same #person#
any news inquired $mr_fagin$ great and and good asked $mr_fagin$ hesitating as though he feared to vex the other #man# by being too sanguine
not bad any #way# replied monks with a smile i have been prompt enough this #time# let me have a #word# with you
the #girl# drew closer to the #table# and made no offer to leave the #room# although she could see that monks was pointing to her
the jew perhaps fearing she might say #something# aloud about the money if he endeavoured to get rid of her pointed upward and took monks out of the #room#
$mr_fagin$ laughed and making some reply which did not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his #companion# to the second story
before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the #house# the #girl# had slipped off her shoes and drawing her gown loosely over her #head# and muffling her #arm# in it stood at the #door# listening with breathless interest
the #moment# the noise ceased she glided from the #room# ascended the stairs with incredible softness and #silence# and was lost in the gloom above
the #room# remained deserted for a quarter of an #hour# or more the #girl# glided back with the same unearthly tread and immediately afterwards the two #man# were heard descending
not that infernal hole we were in before she could hear the #man# say as they went upstairs monks went at once into the #street# and the jew crawled upstairs again for the money
when he returned the #girl# was adjusting her shawl and bonnet as if preparing to be gone why nance exclaimed the jew starting back as he put down the candle how pale you are pale
echoed the #girl# shading her #eye# with her #hand# as if to #look# steadily at him quite horrible what have you been doing to yourself
#nothing# that i know of except sitting in this close #place# for i dont know how long and all replied the #girl# carelessly
come let me get back that a #dear# with a sigh for every piece of money $mr_fagin$ told the amount into her #hand#
when the #girl# got into the open #street# she sat down upon a doorstep and seemed for a few #moment# wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her #way#
suddenly she arose and hurrying on in a direction quite opposite to that in which $mr_william_sikes$ was awaiting her returned quickened her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run
after completely exhausting herself she stopped to take breath and as if suddenly recollecting herself and deploring her inability to do #something# she was bent upon wrung her #hand# and burst into #tear#
it might be that her #tear# relieved her or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition but she turned back and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction partly to recover lost #time# and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own #thought# soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker
if she betrayed any agitation when she presented herself to $mr_william_sikes$ he did not observe it for merely inquiring if she had brought the money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of satisfaction and replacing his #head# upon the pillow resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted
it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next #day# in the #way# of eating and drinking and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper that he had neither #time# nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment
that she had all the abstracted and nervous #manner# of #one# who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would have been obvious to the lynx eyed $mr_fagin$ who would most probably have taken the alarm at once but $mr_william_sikes$ lacking the niceties of discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody and being furthermore in an unusually amiable condition as has been already observed saw #nothing# unusual in her demeanor and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions
as that #day# closed in the #girl# excitement increased and when #night# came on and she sat by watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and a #fire# in her #eye# that even $mr_william_sikes$ observed with astonishment
$mr_william_sikes$ being weak from the fever was lying in #bed# taking hot #water# with his gin to render it less inflammatory and had pushed his glass towards $miss_nancy$ to be replenished for the third or fourth #time# when these symptoms first struck him
they parted without more conversation merely interchanging a good #night# why burn my body said the #man# raising himself on his #hand# as he stared the #girl# in the #face#
you #look# like a corpse come to #life# again what the #matter# matter replied the #girl# #nothing# what do you #look# at me so hard for
what foolery is this demanded $mr_william_sikes$ grasping her by the #arm# and shaking her roughly what is it what do you mean
what are you thinking of of many #thing# $bill_sikes$ replied the #girl# shivering and as she did so pressing her #hand# upon her #eye#
the tone of forced gaiety in which the last #word# were spoken seemed to produce a deeper impression on $mr_william_sikes$ than the wild and rigid #look# which had preceded them
i tell you wot it is said $mr_william_sikes$ if you havent caught the fever and got it comin on now there #something# more than usual in the wind and #something# dangerous too
but lord what odds in that you re not a going to no damme you wouldnt do that do what asked the #girl#
there aint said $mr_william_sikes$ fixing his #eye# upon her and muttering the #word# to himself there aint a stauncher hearted gal going or i have cut her throat three months ago
fortifying himself with this assurance $mr_william_sikes$ drained the glass to the bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic
the #girl# jumped up with great alacrity poured it quickly out but with her back towards him and held the vessel to his lips while he drank off the contents
now said the robber come and sit aside of me and put on your own #face# or i ll alter it so that you wont know it agin when you do want it
she got the fever coming on that it the #girl# obeyed $mr_william_sikes$ locking her #hand# in his fell back upon the pillow turning his #eye# upon her #face#
he shifted his position restlessly and after dozing again and again for two or three #minute# and as often springing up with a #look# of terror and gazing vacantly about him was suddenly stricken as it were while in the very attitude of rising into a deep and heavy sleep
the grasp of his #hand# relaxed the upraised #arm# fell languidly by his #side# and he lay like #one# in a profound trance
they closed opened again closed once more again opened the laudanum has taken effect at last murmured the #girl# as she $miss_rose$ from the bedside
she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl looking fearfully round from #time# to #time# as if despite the sleeping draught she expected every #moment# to feel the pressure of $mr_william_sikes$ heavy #hand# upon her shoulder then stooping softly over the #bed# she kissed the robber lips and then opening and closing the #room# #door# with noiseless touch hurried from the #house#
a watchman was crying half past nine down a dark passage through which she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare
i may be too late even now has it long gone the half #hour# asked the #girl# it ll strike the #hour# in another quarter said the #man# raising his lantern to her #face#
and i cannot get there in less than an #hour# or more muttered $miss_nancy$ brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the #street#
many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her #way# in making from spitalfields towards the west end of london
she tore along the narrow pavement elbowing the passengers from #side# to #side# and darting almost under the horses #head# crossed crowded #street# where clusters of #person# were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like
the clock struck ten increasing her impatience the #woman# is mad said the #people# turning to #look# after her as she rushed away
when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town the #street# were comparatively deserted and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past
some quickened their pace behind as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate and a few made #head# upon her and looked back surprised at her undiminished speed but they fell off #one# by #one# and when she neared her #place# of destination she was alone
as the brilliant #light# of the lamp which burnt before its #door# guided her to the spot the clock struck eleven
she had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute and making up her #mind# to advance but the sound determined her and she stepped into the hall
it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome #street# near hyde park the porter seat was vacant she looked round with an #air# of incertitude and advanced towards the stairs
now young #woman# said a smartly dressed female looking out from a #door# behind her who do you want here a #lady# who is stopping in this #house# answered the #girl#
the young #woman# who had by this #time# noted her appearance replied only by a #look# of virtuous disdain and summoned a #man# to answer her
a #lady# was the reply accompanied with a scornful #look# what #lady# $miss_maylie$ said $miss_nancy$ to him $miss_nancy$ repeated her request
what #name# am i to say asked the waiter it of no use saying any replied $miss_nancy$ nor business said the #man#
no nor that neither rejoined the #girl# i must see the #lady# come said the #man# pushing her towards the #door#
i shall be carried out if i go said the #girl# violently and i can make that a job that two of you wont like to do
isnt there anybody here she said looking round that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me
this appeal produced an effect on a good tempered faced #man# cook who with some of the other servants was looking on and who stepped forward to interfere
none of this take yourself off take it up for her joe cant you said this #person# what the good replied the #man#
this allusion to $miss_nancy$ doubtful character raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids who remarked with great fervour that the creature was a disgrace to her sex and strongly advocated her being thrown ruthlessly into the kennel
do what you like with me said the #girl# turning to the #man# again but do what i ask you first and i ask you to give this message for god almighty sake
the soft hearted cook added his intercession and the result was that the #man# who had first appeared undertook its delivery
you dont suppose the young #lady# will see such as her do you what it to be said the #man# with #one# #foot# on the stairs
that a young #woman# earnestly asks to speak to $miss_maylie$ alone said $miss_nancy$ and that if the #lady# will only hear the first #word# she has to say she will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned out of #door# as an impostor
i say said the #man# you re coming it strong you give the message said the #girl# firmly and let me hear the answer
$miss_nancy$ remained pale and almost breathless listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific and of which they became still more so when the #man# returned and said the young #woman# was to walk upstairs
the #man# ran upstairs it no good being proper in this world said the first housemaid brass can do better than the gold what has stood the #fire# said the second
the third contented herself with wondering what #lady# was made of and the fourth took the first in a quartette of shameful with which the dianas concluded
regardless of all this for she had weightier #matter# at #heart# $miss_nancy$ followed the #man# with trembling limbs to a small ante chamber lighted by a lamp from the ceiling
the #girl# #life# had been squandered in the #street# and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of london but there was #something# of the #woman# original nature left in her still and when she heard a #light# step approaching the #door# opposite to that by which she had entered and #thought# of the wide contrast which the small #room# would in another #moment# contain she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview
but struggling with these better feelings was pride the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self assured
the miserable #companion# of thieves and ruffians the fallen outcast of low haunts the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks living within the shadow of the gallows itself even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she #thought# a weakness but which alone connected her with that humanity of which her wasting #life# had obliterated so many many traces when a very #child#
she raised her #eye# sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful #girl# then bending them on the #ground# she tossed her #head# with affected carelessness as she said it a hard #matter# to get to see you #lady#
if i had taken offence and gone away as many would have done you have been sorry for it #one# #day# and not without reason either
here he left her and retired #chapter# xl a strange interview which is a sequel to the last chamber i am very sorry if any #one# has behaved harshly to you replied $miss_rose$
the kind tone of this answer the sweet #voice# the gentle #manner# the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure took the #girl# completely by surprise and she burst into #tear#
do not think of that tell me why you wished to see me i am the #person# you inquired for oh #lady# lady
she said clasping her #hand# passionately before her #face# if there was more like you there would be fewer like me there would there would
sit down said $miss_rose$ earnestly if you are in poverty or affliction i shall be truly glad to relieve you if i
let me stand #lady# said the #girl# still weeping and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better
can i shall indeed sit down it is growing late is is that #door# shut yes said $miss_rose$ recoiling a few steps as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it
i am the #girl# that dragged little $oliver_twist$ back to old $mr_fagin$ on the #night# he went out from the #house# in pentonville
why because said the #girl# i am about to put my #life# and the #life# of others in your #hand# you said $miss_rose$ maylie
i am the infamous creature you have heard of that #life# among the thieves and that never from the first #moment# i can recollect my #eye# and senses opening on london #street# have known any better #life# or kinder #word# than they have given me so help me god
i #lady# replied the #girl# do not #mind# shrinking openly from me #lady# i am younger than you would think to #look# at me but i am well used to it
the poorest #woman# fall back as i make my #way# along the crowded pavement what dreadful #thing# are these said $miss_rose$ involuntarily falling from her strange #companion#
thank heaven upon your knees #dear# #lady# cried the #girl# that you had #friend# to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness and and #something# worse than all as i have been from my cradle
i may use the #word# for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed i pity you
said $miss_rose$ in a broken #voice# it wrings my #heart# to hear you heaven bless you for your goodness rejoined the #girl#
but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to tell you what i have overheard
if you knew what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed do you know a #man# named monks no said $miss_rose$
he knows you replied the #girl# and knew you were here for it was by hearing him tell the #place# that i found you out i never heard the #name# said $miss_rose$
some #time# ago and soon after $oliver_twist$ was put into your #house# on the #night# of the robbery i suspecting this #man# listened to a conversation held between him and $mr_fagin$ in the dark
then he goes by some other amongst us rejoined the #girl# which i more than #thought# before i found out from what i heard that monks the #man# i asked you about you know
monks pursued the #girl# had seen him accidently with two of our #boy# on the #day# we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same #child# that he was watching for though i couldnt make out why
a bargain was struck with $mr_fagin$ that if $oliver_twist$ was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own
he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out said the #girl# and there are not many #people# besides me that could have got out of their #way# in #time# to escape discovery
yes said $miss_rose$ i understand that for what purpose asked $miss_rose$ but i did and i saw him no more till last #night#
again they went upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me again listened at the #door#
and what occurred then i ll tell you #lady# last #night# he came again the first #word# i heard monks say were these
so the only proofs of the #boy# identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the #mother# is rotting in her coffin
they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the #boy# and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devil money safely now he rather have had it the other #way# for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which $mr_fagin$ could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides
what is all this said $miss_rose$ the truth #lady# though it comes from my lips replied the #girl#
then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the #boy# #life# without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldnt he be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in #life# and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet
in short $mr_fagin$ he says jew as you are you never laid such snares as i ll contrive for my young brother $oliver_twist$
those were his #word# said $miss_nancy$ glancing uneasily round as she had scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of $mr_william_sikes$ haunted her perpetually
when he spoke of you and the other #lady# and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that $oliver_twist$ should come into your #hand# he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your two legged spaniel was
his brother exclaimed $miss_rose$ and more you do not mean said $miss_rose$ turning very pale to tell me that this was said in earnest
he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a #man# ever did replied the #girl# shaking her #head# he is an earnest #man# when his hatred is up
i know many who do worse #thing# but i rather listen to them all a dozen #time# than to that monks once
it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this
i must get back quickly but what can i do said $miss_rose$ to what use can i turn this communication without you
if you repeat this information to a #gentleman# whom i can summon in an instant from the next #room# you can be consigned to some #place# of safety without half an #hour# delay i wish to go back said the #girl#
i must go back because how can i tell such #thing# to an innocent #lady# like you because among the #man# i have told you of there is #one# the most desperate among them all that i cant leave no not even to be saved from the #life# i am leading now
your having interfered in this #dear# #boy# behalf before said $miss_rose$ your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your #manner# which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed
oh said the earnest #girl# folding her #hand# as the #tear# coursed down her #face# do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of #one# of your own sex the first the first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the #voice# of pity and compassion
back why do you wish to return to #companion# you paint in such terrible colors do hear my #word# and let me save you yet for better #thing#
#lady# cried the #girl# sinking on her knees #dear# sweet angel #lady# you are the first that ever blessed me with such #word# as these and if i had heard them #year# ago they might have turned me from a #life# of sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late
it is never too late said $miss_rose$ for penitence and atonement it is cried the #girl# writhing in agony of her #mind# i cannot leave him now
i could not be his #death# why should you be asked $miss_rose$ #nothing# could save him cried the #girl#
if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die
is it possible cried $miss_rose$ that for such a #man# as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue
i dont know what it is answered the #girl# i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself
whether it is god wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his #hand# at last
he is the boldest and has been so cruel it is madness i must go back what am i to do said $miss_rose$
i should not let you depart from me thus you should #lady# and i know you will rejoined the #girl# rising
you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done
this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me benefit $oliver_twist$ whom you are anxious to serve you must have some kind #gentleman# about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do rejoined the #girl#
of what use then is the communication you have made said $miss_rose$ but where can i find you again when it is necessary asked $miss_rose$
i do not seek to know where these dreadful #people# live but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this #time#
will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other #person# that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed asked the #girl#
every sunday #night# from eleven until the clock strikes twelve said the #girl# without hesitation i will walk on london bridge if i am alive
i promise you solemnly answered $miss_rose$ stay another #moment# interposed $miss_rose$ as the #girl# moved hurriedly towards the #door#
you have a claim on me not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a #woman# lost almost beyond redemption
think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it will you return to this gang of robbers and to this #man# when a #word# can save you
what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery oh is there no chord in your #heart# that i can touch
when #lady# as young and good and beautiful as you are replied the #girl# steadily give away your #heart# love will carry you all #length# even such as you who have home #friend# other admirers everything to fill them
when such as i who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no #friend# in sickness or #death# but the hospital nurse set our rotten #heart# on any #man# and let him fill the #place# that has been a blank through all our wretched #life# who can hope to cure us
pity us #lady# pity us for having only #one# feeling of the #woman# left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering
you will said $miss_rose$ after a pause take some money from me which may enable you to live without dishonesty at all events until we meet again
is there #nothing# left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation not a penny replied the #girl# waving her #hand#
do not close your #heart# against all my efforts to help you said $miss_rose$ stepping gently forward i wish to serve you indeed
you would serve me best #lady# replied the #girl# wringing her #hand# if you could take my #life# at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am to #night# than i ever did before and it would be #something# not to die in the hell in which i have lived
god bless you sweet #lady# and send as much happiness on your #head# as i have brought shame on mine
thus speaking and sobbing aloud the unhappy creature turned away while $miss_rose$ maylie overpowered by this extraordinary interview which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence sank into a #chair# and endeavoured to collect her wandering #thought#
#chapter# xli containing fresh discoveries and showing that suprises like misfortunes seldom come alone her situation was indeed #one# of no common trial and difficulty
while she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which $oliver_twist$ history was enveloped she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable #woman# with whom she had just conversed had reposed in her as a young and guileless #girl#
her #word# and #manner# had touched $miss_rose$ maylie #heart# and mingled with her love for her young charge and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope
they purposed remaining in london only three #day# prior to departing for some weeks to a distant #part# of the coast
it was now midnight of the first #day# what course of action could she determine upon which could be adopted in eight and forty #hour#
$mr_losberne$ was with them and would be for the next two #day# but $miss_rose$ was too well acquainted with the excellent #gentleman# impetuosity and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which in the first explosion of his indignation he would regard the instrument of $oliver_twist$ recapture to trust him with the secret when her representations in the #girl# behalf could be seconded by no experienced #person#
these were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to $mrs_maylie$ whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy #doctor# on the subject
as to resorting to any legal adviser even if she had known how to do so it was scarcely to be #thought# of for the same reason
once the #thought# occurred to her of seeking assistance from $harry_maylie$ but this awakened the recollection of their last parting and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back when the #tear# $miss_rose$ to her #eye# as she pursued this train of reflection he might have by this #time# learnt to forget her and to be happier away
disturbed by these different reflections inclining now to #one# course and then to another and again recoiling from all as each successive consideration presented itself to her #mind# $miss_rose$ passed a sleepless and anxious #night#
or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion after more communing with herself next #day# she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting $harry_maylie$
if it be painful to him she #thought# to come back here how painful it will be to me but perhaps he will not come he may write or he may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting me
and here $miss_rose$ dropped the pen and turned away as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep
she had taken up the same pen and laid it down again fifty #time# and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first #word# when $oliver_twist$ who had been walking in the #street# with $mr_giles$ for a body guard entered the #room# in such breathless haste and violent agitation as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm
he did when he went away i hardly #thought# he would but it was better for us both what makes you #look# so flurried asked $miss_rose$ advancing to meet him
to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth i never #thought# you had told us #anything# but the truth said $miss_rose$ soothing him
i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked replied the #boy# oh #dear# but what is this of whom do you speak
i have seen the #gentleman# replied $oliver_twist$ scarcely able to articulate the #gentleman# who was so good to me $mr_brownlow$ that we have so often talked about
i didnt speak to him i couldnt speak to him for he didnt see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go up to him
where asked $miss_rose$ getting out of a coach replied $oliver_twist$ shedding #tear# of delight and going into a #house# but $mr_giles$ asked for me whether he lived there and they said he did
#look# here said $oliver_twist$ opening a scrap of paper here it is here where he #life# i going there directly oh #dear# me #dear# me
with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy $miss_rose$ read the address which was craven #street# in the strand
what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again she very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account
quick she said tell them to fetch a hackney coach and be ready to go with me i will take you there directly without a #minute# loss of #time#
i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an #hour# and be ready as soon as you are
$oliver_twist$ needed no prompting to despatch and in little more than five #minute# they were on their #way# to craven #street#
when they arrived there $miss_rose$ left $oliver_twist$ in the coach under pretence of preparing the old #gentleman# to receive him and sending up her card by the servant requested to see $mr_brownlow$ on very pressing business
the servant soon returned to beg that she would walk upstairs and following him into an upper #room# $miss_maylie$ was presented to an elderly #gentleman# of benevolent appearance in a bottle green coat
at no great distance from whom was seated another old #gentleman# in nankeen breeches and gaiters who did not #look# particularly benevolent and who was sitting with his #hand# clasped on the top of a thick stick and his chin propped thereupon
#dear# me said the #gentleman# in the bottle green coat hastily rising with great politeness i beg your pardon young #lady# i imagined it was some importunate #person# who i beg you will excuse me
be seated pray $mr_brownlow$ i believe #sir# said $miss_rose$ glancing from the other #gentleman# to the #one# who had spoken
$mr_grimwig$ will you leave us for a few #minute# i believe interposed $miss_maylie$ that at this period of our interview i need not give that #gentleman# the trouble of going away
that is my #name# said the old #gentleman# this is my #friend# $mr_grimwig$ if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i wish to speak to you
$mr_grimwig$ who had made #one# very stiff bow and risen from his #chair# made another very stiff bow and dropped into it again
i have no doubt said $miss_rose$ naturally embarrassed but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very #dear# young #friend# of mine and i am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again
$mr_brownlow$ inclined his #head# i shall surprise you very much indeed said $mr_brownlow$ $oliver_twist$ you knew him as replied $miss_rose$
the #word# no sooner escaped her lips than $mr_grimwig$ who had been affecting to dip into a large #book# that lay on the #table# upset it with a great crash and falling back in his #chair# discharged from his features every expression but #one# of unmitigated wonder and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare then as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion he jerked himself as it were by a convulsion into his former attitude and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle which seemed at last not to be discharged on empty #air# but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach
he drew his #chair# nearer to $miss_maylie$ and said do me the favour my #dear# young #lady# to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which nobody else knows #anything# and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor #child# in heaven #name# put me in possession of it
i ll eat my #head# if he is not a bad #one# growled $mr_grimwig$ speaking by some ventriloquial power without moving a muscle of his #face#
he is a #child# of a noble nature and a warm #heart# said $miss_rose$ colouring and that power which has #thought# fit to try him beyond his #year# has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his #day# six #time# over
mr browlow was no less surprised although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric #manner# a bad #one#
if this $oliver_twist$ is not twelve #year# old at least i dont see the application of that remark do not heed my #friend# $miss_maylie$ said $mr_brownlow$ he does not mean what he says
i only sixty #one# said $mr_grimwig$ with the same rigid #face# and as the devil in it yes he does growled $mr_grimwig$
no he does not said $mr_brownlow$ obviously rising in wrath as he spoke he ll eat his #head# if he doesnt growled $mr_grimwig$
and he uncommonly like to see any #man# offer to do it responded $mr_grimwig$ knocking his stick upon the floor
having gone thus far the two old #gentleman# severally took snuff and afterwards shook #hand# according to their invariable custom
he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does said $mr_brownlow$ now $miss_maylie$ said $mr_brownlow$ to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested
will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor #child# allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me has been considerably shaken
$miss_rose$ who had had #time# to collect her #thought# at once related in a few natural #word# all that had befallen $oliver_twist$ since he left $mr_brownlow$ #house# reserving $miss_nancy$ information for that #gentleman# private ear and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow for some months past had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and #friend#
thank god said the old #gentleman# this is great happiness to me great happiness but you have not told me where he is now $miss_maylie$
you must pardon my finding fault with you but why not have brought him he is waiting in a coach at the #door# replied $miss_rose$
with which he hurried out of the #room# down the stairs up the coachsteps and into the coach without another #word#
when the #room# #door# closed behind him $mr_grimwig$ lifted up his #head# and converting #one# of the hind legs of his #chair# into a pivot described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the #table# sitting in it all the #time#
after performing this evolution he $miss_rose$ and limped as fast as he could up and down the #room# at least a dozen #time# and then stopping suddenly before $miss_rose$ kissed her without the slightest preface
at this #door# cried the old #gentleman# hush he said as the young #lady# $miss_rose$ in some alarm at this unusual proceeding
in fact as he threw himself at #one# dexterous dive into his former seat $mr_brownlow$ returned accompanied by $oliver_twist$ whom $mr_grimwig$ received very graciously and if the gratification of that #moment# had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in $oliver_twist$ behalf $miss_rose$ maylie would have been well repaid
dont be afraid i old enough to be your grandfather you re a sweet #girl# i like you here they are there is somebody else who should not be forgotten by the bye said $mr_brownlow$ ringing the bell
send $mrs_bedwin$ here if you please the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch and dropping a curtsey at the #door# waited for orders
why you get blinder every #day# $mrs_bedwin$ said $mr_brownlow$ rather testily well that i do #sir# replied the old #lady#
i could have told you that rejoined $mr_brownlow$ but put on your glasses and see if you cant find out what you were wanted for will you
#people# #eye# at my #time# of #life# dont improve with age #sir# the old #lady# began to rummage in her #pocket# for her spectacles
but $oliver_twist$ patience was not proof against this new trial and yielding to his first impulse he sprang into her #arm#
god be good to me cried the old #lady# embracing him it is my innocent #boy# my #dear# old nurse cried $oliver_twist$
he would come back i knew he would said the old #lady# holding him in her #arm# how well he #look# and how like a #gentleman# son he is dressed again
where have you been this long long while ah the same sweet #face# but not so pale the same soft #eye# but not so sad
i have never forgotten them or his quiet smile but have seen them every #day# #side# by #side# with those of my own #dear# #child# dead and gone since i was a lightsome young creature
running on thus and now holding $oliver_twist$ from her to mark how he had grown now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns
leaving her and $oliver_twist$ to compare notes at leisure $mr_brownlow$ led the #way# into another #room# and there heard from $miss_rose$ a full narration of her interview with $miss_nancy$ which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity
the old #gentleman# considered that she had acted prudently and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy #doctor# himself
to afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight clock that evening and that in the meantime $mrs_maylie$ should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred
$miss_rose$ also explained her reasons for not confiding in her #friend# $mr_losberne$ in the first instance these preliminaries adjusted $miss_rose$ and $oliver_twist$ returned home
$miss_nancy$ history was no sooner unfolded to him than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs blathers and $duff$ and actually put on his #hat# preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies
and doubtless he would in this first outbreak have carried the intention into effect without a #moment# consideration of the consequences if he had not been restrained in #part# by corresponding violence on the #side# of $mr_brownlow$ who was himself of an irascible temperament and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose
$miss_rose$ had by no means overrated the measure of the good #doctor# wrath then what the devil is to be done said the impetuous #doctor# when they had rejoined the two #lady#
are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to $oliver_twist$ not exactly that rejoined $mr_brownlow$ laughing but we must proceed gently and with great care
gentleness and care exclaimed the #doctor# i send them #one# and all to never #mind# where interposed $mr_brownlow$
but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view what object asked the #doctor#
simply the discovery of $oliver_twist$ parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived
you see pursued $mr_brownlow$ placing this poor #girl# entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about
ah said $mr_losberne$ cooling himself with his #pocket# handkerchief i almost forgot that hanging a few of them at least in all probability suggested the #doctor# and transporting the rest
very good replied $mr_brownlow$ smiling but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of #time# and if we step in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interest or at least to $oliver_twist$ which is the same #thing#
it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this #man# monks upon his knees
how inquired the #doctor# thus that can only be done by stratagem and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these #people#
he is not even so far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies
if he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot
then said the #doctor# impetuously i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the #girl# should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really do not discuss the point my #dear# young #lady# pray said $mr_brownlow$ interrupting $miss_rose$ as she was about to speak
for suppose he were apprehended we have no proof against him the promise shall be kept i dont think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings
but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the #girl# to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his #person# as will enable us to identify him
she cannot be seen until next sunday #night# this is tuesday i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these #matter# secret even from $oliver_twist$ himself
although $mr_losberne$ received with many wry #face# a proposal involving a delay of five whole #day# he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then and as both $miss_rose$ and $mrs_maylie$ sided very strongly with $mr_brownlow$ that #gentleman# proposition was carried unanimously
he is a strange creature but a shrewd #one# and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only #one# brief and a motion of course in twenty #year# though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves
i should like he said to call in the aid of my #friend# $mr_grimwig$ i have no objection to your calling in your #friend# if i may call in mine said the #doctor#
that #lady# son and this young #lady# very old #friend# said the #doctor# motioning towards $mrs_maylie$ and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece
$miss_rose$ blushed deeply but she did not make any audible objection to this motion possibly she felt in a hopeless minority and $harry_maylie$ and $mr_grimwig$ were accordingly added to the committee
we stay in town of course said $mrs_maylie$ while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success
i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains
we must put it to the vote replied $mr_brownlow$ who may he be good rejoined $mr_brownlow$
and as i see on the #face# about me a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the #way# to corroborate $oliver_twist$ tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such #time# as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story
believe me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough
supper has been announced and young $oliver_twist$ who is all alone in the next #room# will have begun to think by this #time# that we have wearied of his company and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world
come with these #word# the old #gentleman# gave his #hand# to $mrs_maylie$ and escorted her into the supper #room# $mr_losberne$ followed leading $miss_rose$ and the council was for the present effectually broken up
upon the #night# when $miss_nancy$ having lulled $mr_william_sikes$ to sleep hurried on her self imposed mission to $miss_rose$ maylie there advanced towards london by the great north road two #person# upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention
they were a #man# and #woman# or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female for the former was #one# of those long limbed knock kneed shambling bony #people# to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age looking as they do when they are yet #boy# like undergrown #man# and when they are almost #man# like overgrown #boy#
the #woman# was young but of a robust and hardy make as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back
her #companion# was not encumbered with much luggage as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief and apparently #light# enough
this circumstance added to the #length# of his legs which were of unusual extent enabled him with much ease to keep some half dozen paces in advance of his #companion# to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the #head# as if reproaching her tardiness and urging her to greater exertion
thus they had toiled along the dusty road taking little heed of any object within sight save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail coaches which were whirling out of town until they passed through highgate archway when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his #companion# come on cant yer
#chapter# xlii an old acquaintance of $oliver_twist$ exhibiting decided marks of genius becomes a public character in the metropolis what a lazybones yer are $charlotte$
it a heavy load i can tell you said the female coming up almost breathless with fatigue heavy what are yer talking about
what are yer made for rejoined the male traveller changing his own little bundle as he spoke to the other shoulder
oh there yer are resting again well if yer aint enough to tire anybody patience out i dont know what is is it much farther
asked the #woman# resting herself against a bank and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her #face# much farther
yer as good as there said the long legged tramper pointing out before him #look# there those are the #light# of london
never #mind# whether they re two mile off or twenty said $mr_noah_claypole$ for he it was but get up and come on or i ll kick yer
as $mr_noah_claypole$ red nose grew redder with anger and as he crossed the road while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution the #woman# $miss_rose$ without any further remark and trudged onward by his #side#
they re a good two mile off at least said the #woman# despondingly and so i give yer notice where do you mean to stop for the #night# $mr_noah_claypole$
she asked after they had walked a few hundred yards how should i know replied $mr_noah_claypole$ whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking
near i hope said $charlotte$ no not near replied $mr_noah_claypole$ there not near so dont think it why not
when i tell yer that i dont mean to do a #thing# that enough without any why or because either replied $mr_noah_claypole$ with dignity
a pretty #thing# it would be wouldnt it to go and stop at the very first public #house# outside the town so that $mr_sowerberry$ if he come up after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on said $mr_noah_claypole$ in a jeering tone
i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest #street# i can find and not stop till we come to the very out of the wayest #house# i can set #eye# on
i ve got a #head# for if we hadnt gone at first the wrong road a purpose and come back across country yer have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my #lady#
well you neednt be so cross said his #companion# no cod yer may thanks yer stars and serve yer right for being a fool
i know i aint as cunning as you are replied $charlotte$ but dont put all the blame on me and say i should have been locked up
you would have been if i had been any #way# yer took the money from the till yer know yer did said $mr_noah_claypole$
no you trusted in me and let me carry it like a #dear# and so you are said the #lady# chucking him under the chin and drawing her #arm# through his
this was indeed the case but as it was not $mr_noah_claypole$ habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody it should be observed in justice to that #gentleman# that he had trusted $charlotte$ to this extent in order that if they were pursued the money might be found on her which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape
i took it for you $mr_noah_claypole$ #dear# rejoined $charlotte$ did i keep it asked $mr_noah_claypole$ of course he entered at this juncture into no explanation of his motives and they walked on very lovingly together
in pursuance of this cautious plan $mr_noah_claypole$ went on without halting until he arrived at the angel at islington where he wisely judged from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles that london began in earnest
just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded #street# and consequently the most to be avoided he crossed into saint $mr_john_dawkins$ road and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty #way# which lying between gray inn lane and smithfield render that #part# of the town #one# of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of london
through these #street# $mr_noah_claypole$ walked dragging $charlotte$ after him now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public #house# now jogging on again as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose
at #length# he stopped in front of #one# more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen and having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement graciously announced his intention of putting up there for the #night#
so give us the bundle said $mr_noah_claypole$ unstrapping it from the #woman# shoulders and slinging it over his own and dont yer speak except when yer spoke to
what the #name# of the houset r three what cripples said $charlotte$ three cripples repeated $mr_noah_claypole$ and a very good sign too
now then keep close at my heels and come along with these injunctions he pushed the rattling #door# with his shoulder and entered the #house# followed by his #companion#
there was nobody in the bar but a young jew who with his two elbows on the counter was reading a dirty newspaper
if $mr_noah_claypole$ had been attired in his charity #boy# dress there might have been some reason for the jew opening his #eye# so wide but as he had discarded the coat and badge and wore a short smock frock over his leathers there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public #house#
he stared very hard at $mr_noah_claypole$ and $mr_noah_claypole$ stared very hard at him is this the three cripples asked $mr_noah_claypole$
a #gentleman# we met on the road coming up from the country recommended us here said $mr_noah_claypole$ nudging $charlotte$ perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise
that is the dabe of this ouse replied the jew we want to sleep here to #night# i dot certaid you cad said $barney$ who was the attendant sprite
show us the tap and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring will yer said $mr_noah_claypole$
$barney$ complied by ushering them into a small back #room# and setting the required viands before them having done which he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that #night# and left the amiable couple to their refreshment
now this back #room# was immediately behind the bar and some steps lower so that any #person# connected with the #house# undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last named apartment about five #foot# from its flooring could not only #look# down upon any guests in the back #room# without any great hazard of being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself but could by applying his ear to the partition ascertain with tolerable distinctness their subject of conversation
the landlord of the #house# had not withdrawn his #eye# from this #place# of espial for five #minute# and $barney$ had only just returned from making the communication above related when $mr_fagin$ in the course of his evening business came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils
but i ll idquire hush said $barney$ stradegers id the next roob strangers repeated the old #man# in a whisper
ah ad rub uds too added $barney$ frob the cuttry but subthig in your #way# or i bistaked $mr_fagin$ appeared to receive this communication with great interest
mounting a stool he cautiously applied his #eye# to the pane of glass from which secret post he could see $mr_noah_claypole$ taking cold beef from the dish and porter from the pot and administering homeopathic doses of both to $charlotte$ who sat patiently by eating and drinking at his pleasure
aha he whispered looking round to $barney$ i like that fellow #look# he be of use to us he knows how to train the #girl# already
he again applied his #eye# to the glass and turning his ear to the partition listened attentively with a subtle and eager #look# upon his #face# that might have appertained to some old goblin
so i mean to be a #gentleman# said $mr_noah_claypole$ kicking out his legs and continuing a conversation the commencement of which $mr_fagin$ had arrived too late to hear
dont make as much noise as a mouse my #dear# and let me hear em talk let me hear em no more jolly old coffins $charlotte$ but a #gentleman# #life# for me and if yer
like yer shall be a #lady# i should like that well enough #dear# replied $charlotte$ but tills aint to be emptied every #day# and #people# to get clear off after it
tills be blowed said $mr_noah_claypole$ there more #thing# besides tills to be emptied what do you mean asked his #companion#
#pocket# #woman# ridicules #house# mail coaches banks said $mr_noah_claypole$ rising with the porter but you cant do all that #dear# said $charlotte$
i shall #look# out to get into company with them as can replied $mr_noah_claypole$ they ll be able to make us useful some #way# or another
why you yourself are worth fifty #woman# i never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer
lor how nice it is to hear yer say so exclaimed $charlotte$ imprinting a kiss upon his ugly #face# there that ll do dont yer be too affectionate in case
i should like to be the captain of some band and have the whopping of em and follering em about unbeknown to themselves
that would suit me if there was good profit and if we could only get in with some #gentleman# of this sort i say it would be cheap at that twenty pound note you ve got especially as we dont very well know how to get rid of it ourselves
after expressing this opinion $mr_noah_claypole$ looked into the porter pot with an aspect of deep wisdom and having well shaken its contents nodded condescendingly to $charlotte$ and took a draught wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed
i cross with yer said $mr_noah_claypole$ disengaging himself with great gravity he was meditating another when the sudden opening of the #door# and the appearance of a stranger interrupted him
and very amiable he looked and a very low bow he made as he advanced and setting himself down at the nearest #table# ordered #something# to drink of the grinning $barney$
the stranger was $mr_fagin$ a pleasant #night# #sir# but cool for the #time# of #year# said $mr_fagin$ rubbing his #hand#
we have not so much dust as that in london replied $mr_fagin$ pointing from $mr_noah_claypole$ shoes to those of his #companion# and from them to the two bundles
from the country i see #sir# how do yer see that asked $mr_noah_claypole$ yer a sharp feller said $mr_noah_claypole$
why #one# need be sharp in this town my #dear# replied the jew sinking his #voice# to a confidential whisper and that the truth
$mr_fagin$ followed up this remark by striking the #side# of his nose with his right forefinger a gesture which $mr_noah_claypole$ attempted to imitate though not with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose
however $mr_fagin$ seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and put about the liquor which $barney$ reappeared with in a very friendly #manner#
a #man# need be always emptying a till or a #pocket# or a #woman# reticule or a #house# or a mail coach or a bank if he drinks it regularly
$mr_noah_claypole$ no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his #chair# and looked from the jew to $charlotte$ with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror
ha ha only hear that $charlotte$ good stuff that observed $mr_noah_claypole$ smacking his lips #dear# said $mr_fagin$ dont #mind# me my #dear#
said $mr_fagin$ drawing his #chair# closer ha ha it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance
i didnt take it stammered $mr_noah_claypole$ no longer stretching out his legs like an independent #gentleman# but coiling them up as well as he could under his #chair# it was all her doing yer ve got it now $charlotte$ yer know yer have
no #matter# who got it or who did it my #dear# replied $mr_fagin$ glancing nevertheless with a hawk #eye# at the #girl# and the two bundles
it was very lucky it was only me i in that #way# myself and i like you for it
in what #way# asked $mr_noah_claypole$ a little recovering in that #way# of business rejoined $mr_fagin$ and so are the #people# of the #house#
there is not a safer #place# in all this town than is the cripples that is when i like to make it
and i have taken a fancy to you and the young #woman# so i ve said the #word# and you may make your #mind# easy
$mr_noah_claypole$ #mind# might have been at ease after this assurance but his body certainly was not for he shuffled and writhed about into various uncouth positions eyeing his new #friend# meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion
i ll tell you more said $mr_fagin$ after he had reassured the #girl# by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements
i have got a #friend# that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right #way# where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first and be taught all the others
you ve hit the right nail upon the #head# and are as safe here as you could be so yer speak as if yer were in earnest replied $mr_noah_claypole$
what advantage would it be to me to be #anything# else inquired $mr_fagin$ shrugging his shoulders here let me have a #word# with you outside
there no occasion to trouble ourselves to move said $mr_noah_claypole$ getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again she ll take the luggage upstairs the while
this mandate which had been delivered with great majesty was obeyed without the slightest demur and $charlotte$ made the best of her #way# off with the packages while $mr_noah_claypole$ held the #door# open and watched her out
$charlotte$ see to them bundles she kept tolerably well under aint she he asked as he resumed his seat in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal
quite perfect rejoined $mr_fagin$ clapping him on the shoulder you re a genius my #dear# why i suppose if i wasnt i shouldnt be here replied $mr_noah_claypole$
but i say she ll be back if yer lose #time# now what do you think said $mr_fagin$ if you was to like my #friend# could you do better than join him
is he in a good #way# of business that where it is responded $mr_noah_claypole$ winking #one# of his little #eye#
the top of the tree employs a power of #hand# has the very best society in the profession regular town maders asked $mr_noah_claypole$
not a countryman among em and i dont think he take you even on my recommendation if he didnt run rather short of assistants just now replied $mr_fagin$
should i have to #hand# over said $mr_noah_claypole$ slapping his breeches #pocket# it couldnt possibly be done without replied $mr_fagin$ in a most decided #manner#
twenty pound though it a lot of money not when it in a note you cant get rid of retorted $mr_fagin$
number and date taken i suppose payment stopped at the bank ah it not worth much to him it ll have to go abroad and he couldnt sell it for a great deal in the market
when could i see him asked $mr_noah_claypole$ doubtfully to morrow #morning# where here um said $mr_noah_claypole$ what the wages
live like a #gentleman# board and lodging pipes and spirits free half of all you earn and half of all the young #woman# earns replied $mr_fagin$
whether $mr_noah_claypole$ whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive would have acceded even to these glowing terms had he been a perfectly free agent is very doubtful but as he recollected that in the event of his refusal it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately and more unlikely #thing# had come to pass he gradually relented and said he #thought# that would suit him
but yer see observed $mr_noah_claypole$ as she will be able to do a good deal i should like to take #something# very #light#
a little fancy work suggested $mr_fagin$ ah #something# of that sort replied $mr_noah_claypole$ what do you think would suit me now
#something# not too trying for the strength and not very dangerous you know that the sort of #thing# i heard you talk of #something# in the spy #way# upon the others my #dear# said $mr_fagin$
why i did mention that and i shouldnt #mind# turning my #hand# to it sometimes rejoined $mr_noah_claypole$ slowly but it wouldnt pay by itself you know
my #friend# wants somebody who would do that well very much that true observed the jew ruminating or pretending to ruminate
no it might not what do you think then asked $mr_noah_claypole$ anxiously regarding him #something# in the sneaking #way# where it was pretty sure work and not much more risk than being at home
what do you think of the old #lady# asked $mr_fagin$ there a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels and running round the #corner#
dont they holler out a good deal and scratch sometimes asked $mr_noah_claypole$ shaking his #head# i dont think that would answer my purpose
aint there any other line open stop said $mr_fagin$ laying his #hand# on $mr_noah_claypole$ knee the kinchin lay what that demanded $mr_noah_claypole$
the kinchins my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ is the young #child# that sent on errands by their #mother# with sixpences and shillings and the lay is just to take their money away
they ve always got it ready in their #hand# then knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if there were #nothing# else the #matter# but a #child# fallen down and hurt itself
ha ha ha ha ha roared $mr_noah_claypole$ kicking up his legs in an ecstasy lord that the very #thing#
to be sure it is replied $mr_fagin$ and you can have a few good beats chalked out in camden town and battle bridge and neighborhoods like that where they re always going errands and you can upset as many kinchins as you want any #hour# in the #day#
with this $mr_fagin$ poked $mr_noah_claypole$ in the #side# and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud
ha ha ha well that all right said $mr_noah_claypole$ when he had recovered himself and $charlotte$ had returned what #time# to morrow shall we say
will ten do asked $mr_fagin$ adding as $mr_noah_claypole$ nodded assent what #name# shall i tell my good #friend# $mr_morris_bolter$ replied $mr_noah_claypole$ who had prepared himself for such emergency
$mr_morris_bolter$ this is mrs bolter mrs bolter humble servant said $mr_fagin$ bowing with grotesque politeness i hope i shall know her better very shortly
she calls me $mr_noah_claypole$ as a sort of fond #way# of talking said $mr_morris_bolter$ late claypole turning to $mr_fagin$
do you hear the #gentleman# $charlotte$ thundered $mr_noah_claypole$ yes $mr_noah_claypole$ #dear# replied mrs bolter extending her #hand# you understand
oh yes i understand perfectly replied $mr_fagin$ telling the truth for once good #night# good #night# with many adieus and good wishes $mr_fagin$ went his #way#
$mr_noah_claypole$ bespeaking his good #lady# attention proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made with all that haughtiness and #air# of superiority becoming not only a member of the sterner sex but a #gentleman# who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay in london and its vicinity
that was your own #friend# was it asked $mr_noah_claypole$ otherwise bolter when by virtue of the compact entered into between them he had removed next #day# to $mr_fagin$ #house#
#chapter# xliii wherein is shown how the artful dodger got into trouble and so it was you cod i #thought# as much last #night#
every #man# his own #friend# my #dear# replied $mr_fagin$ with his most insinuating grin he hasnt as good a #one# as himself anywhere
except sometimes replied $mr_morris_bolter$ assuming the #air# of a #man# of the world some #people# are nobody enemies but their own yer know
dont believe that said $mr_fagin$ when a #man# his own enemy it only because he too much his own #friend#
not because he careful for everybody but himself pooh pooh there aint such a #thing# in nature there oughnt to be if there is replied $mr_morris_bolter$
that stands to reason some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven it neither my #friend# neither
in a little community like ours my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ who felt it necessary to qualify this position we have a general number #one# without considering me too as the same and all the other young #people#
it number #one# ha ha cried $mr_morris_bolter$ number #one# for ever oh the devil exclaimed $mr_morris_bolter$
you see pursued $mr_fagin$ affecting to disregard this interruption we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so
for instance it your object to take care of number #one# meaning yourself certainly replied $mr_morris_bolter$ yer about right there
well you cant take care of yourself number #one# without taking care of me number #one# number two you mean said $mr_morris_bolter$ who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness
i say interrupted $mr_morris_bolter$ yer a very nice #man# and i very fond of yer but we aint quite so thick together as all that comes to
no i dont retorted $mr_fagin$ i of the same importance to you as you are to yourself only think said $mr_fagin$ shrugging his shoulders and stretching out his #hand# only consider
you ve done what a very pretty #thing# and what i love you for doing but what at the same #time# would put the cravat round your throat that so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose in plain english the halter
$mr_morris_bolter$ put his #hand# to his neckerchief as if he felt it inconveniently tight and murmured an assent qualified in tone but not in substance
the gallows continued $mr_fagin$ the gallows my #dear# is an ugly finger post which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow career on the broad highway
to keep in the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number #one# with you of course it is replied $mr_morris_bolter$
what do yer talk about such #thing# for only to show you my meaning clearly said the jew raising his eyebrows
to be able to do that you depend upon me to keep my little business all snug i depend upon you
the more you value your number #one# the more careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what i told you at first that a regard for number #one# holds us all together and must do so unless we would all go to pieces in company
the first is your number #one# the second my number #one# that true rejoined $mr_morris_bolter$ thoughtfully oh yer a cunning old codger
$mr_fagin$ saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance
to strengthen an impression so desirable and useful he followed up the blow by acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his operations blending truth and fiction together as best served his purpose and bringing both to bear with so much art that $mr_morris_bolter$ respect visibly increased and became tempered at the same #time# with a degree of wholesome fear which it was highly desirable to awaken
it this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses said $mr_fagin$ my best #hand# was taken from me yesterday #morning#
you dont mean to say he died cried $mr_morris_bolter$ no no replied $mr_fagin$ not so bad as that
not quite so bad what i suppose he was wanted interposed $mr_fagin$ yes he was wanted very particular inquired $mr_morris_bolter$
he was charged with attempting to pick a #pocket# and they found a silver snuff box on him his own my #dear# his own for he took snuff himself and was very fond of it
no replied $mr_fagin$ not very they remanded him till to #day# for they #thought# they knew the owner ah he was worth fifty boxes and i give the price of as many to have him back
you should have known the dodger my #dear# you should have known the dodger well but i shall know him i hope dont yer think so said $mr_morris_bolter$
if they dont get any fresh evidence it ll only be a summary conviction and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so but if they do it a case of lagging
i doubtful about it replied $mr_fagin$ with a sigh they know what a clever lad he is he ll be a lifer
they ll make the artful #nothing# less than a lifer what do you mean by lagging and a lifer demanded $mr_morris_bolter$
$mr_fagin$ was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue and being interpreted $mr_morris_bolter$ would have been informed that they represented that combination of #word# transportation for #life# when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of #master# $charley_bates$ with his #hand# in his breeches #pocket# and his #face# twisted into a #look# of semi comical woe
what the good of talking in that #way# to me why dont yer speak so as i can understand yer it all up $mr_fagin$ said $charley_bates$ when he and his new #companion# had been made known to each other
they ve found the #gentleman# as owns the box two or three more a coming to dentify him and the artful booked for a passage out replied #master# $charley_bates$
i must have a full suit of mourning $mr_fagin$ and a hatband to wisit him in afore he sets out upon his travels
what do you mean to think of jack dawkins lummy jack the dodger the artful dodger going abroad for a common twopenny halfpenny sneeze box i never #thought# he a done it under a gold watch chain and seals at the lowest
oh why didnt he rob some rich old #gentleman# of all his walables and go out as a #gentleman# and not like a common prig without no honour nor glory
with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate #friend# #master# $charley_bates$ sat himself on the nearest #chair# with an aspect of chagrin and despondency
what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for exclaimed $mr_fagin$ darting an angry #look# at his pupil
wasnt he always the top sawyer among you all is there #one# of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent
not #one# replied #master# $charley_bates$ in a #voice# rendered husky by regret not #one# then what do you talk of replied $mr_fagin$ angrily what are you blubbering for
cause it isnt on the rec ord is it said $charley_bates$ chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable #friend# by the current of his regrets cause it cant come out in the dictment cause nobody will never know half of what he was
eh how will he stand in the newgate calendar raps not be there at all oh my #eye# my #eye# wot a blow it is
cried $mr_fagin$ extending his right #hand# and turning to $mr_morris_bolter$ in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy see what a pride they take in their profession my #dear#
$mr_morris_bolter$ nodded assent and $mr_fagin$ after contemplating the grief of $charley_bates$ for some seconds with evident satisfaction stepped up to that young #gentleman# and patted him on the shoulder
they ll all know what a clever fellow he was he ll show it himself and not disgrace his old pals and teachers
ha ha aint it beautiful never #mind# $charley_bates$ said $mr_fagin$ soothingly it ll come out it ll be sure to come out think how young he is too
what a distinction $charley_bates$ to be lagged at his #time# of #life# well it is a honour that is said $charley_bates$ a little consoled
he shall have all he wants continued the jew he shall be kept in the stone jug $charley_bates$ like a #gentleman#
with his beer every #day# and money in his #pocket# to pitch and toss with if he cant spend it
ay that he shall replied $mr_fagin$ and we ll have a big wig $charley_bates$ #one# that got the greatest gift of the gab to carry on his defence and he shall make a speech for himself too if he likes and we ll read it all in the papers artful dodger shrieks of laughter
like a #gentleman# no shall he though cried $charley_bates$ here the court was convulsed eh $charley_bates$ eh ha ha laughed #master# $charley_bates$ what a lark that would be wouldnt it $mr_fagin$
i say how the artful would bother em wouldnt he would cried $mr_fagin$ he shall he will ah to be sure so he will repeated $charley_bates$ rubbing his #hand#
i think i see him now cried the jew bending his #eye# upon his pupil so do i cried $charley_bates$
ha ha ha so do i i see it all afore me upon my soul i do $mr_fagin$ what a game
all the big wigs trying to #look# solemn and jack dawkins addressing of em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge own son making a speech arter dinner
in fact $mr_fagin$ had so well humoured his young #friend# eccentric disposition that #master# $charley_bates$ who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the #light# of a victim now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the #time# when his old #companion# should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities
what a regular game ha ha ha we must know how he gets on to #day# by some handy means or other said $mr_fagin$
let me think shall i go asked $charley_bates$ not for the world replied $mr_fagin$ are you mad my #dear# stark mad that you walk into the very #place# where no $charley_bates$ no
#one# is enough to lose at a #time# you dont mean to go yourself i suppose said $charley_bates$ with a humorous leer
that wouldnt quite fit replied $mr_fagin$ shaking his #head# then why dont you send this new cove asked #master# $charley_bates$ laying his #hand# on $mr_noah_claypole$ #arm#
nobody knows him why if he didnt #mind# observed $mr_fagin$ #mind# interposed $charley_bates$ what should he have to #mind#
oh i dare say about that yer know observed $mr_noah_claypole$ backing towards the #door# and shaking his #head# with a kind of sober alarm
really #nothing# my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ turning to $mr_morris_bolter$ really #nothing# no no none of that it not in my department that aint
the cutting away when there #anything# wrong and the eating all the wittles when there everything right is that his branch never #mind# retorted $mr_morris_bolter$ and dont yer take liberties with yer superiors little #boy# or yer ll
wot department has he got $mr_fagin$ inquired #master# $charley_bates$ surveying $mr_noah_claypole$ lank form with much disgust find yerself in the wrong shop
#master# $charley_bates$ laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it was some #time# before $mr_fagin$ could interpose and represent to $mr_morris_bolter$ that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police office that inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged nor any description of his #person# had yet been forwarded to the metropolis it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter and that if he were properly disguised it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in london inasmuch as it would be of all #place# the very last to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will
persuaded in #part# by these representations but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of $mr_fagin$ $mr_morris_bolter$ at #length# consented with a very bad grace to undertake the expedition
by $mr_fagin$ directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoner frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings all of which articles the jew had at #hand#
he was likewise furnished with a felt #hat# well garnished with turnpike tickets and a carter whip thus equipped he was to saunter into the office
as some country fellow from covent garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity and as he was as awkward ungainly and raw boned a fellow as need be $mr_fagin$ had no fear but that he would #look# the #part# to perfection
these arrangements completed he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger and was conveyed by #master# $charley_bates$ through dark and winding #way# to within a very short distance of bow #street#
having described the precise situation of the office and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage and when he got into the #side# and pull off his #hat# as he went into the #room# $charley_bates$ bade him hurry on alone and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting
$mr_noah_claypole$ or $mr_morris_bolter$ as the reader pleases punctually followed the directions he had received which #master# $charley_bates$ being pretty well acquainted with the locality were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question or meeting with any interruption by the #way#
he found himself jostled among a crowd of #people# chiefly #woman# who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy #room# at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest with a dock for the prisoners on the left #hand# against the wall a box for the witnesses in the middle and a desk for the magistrates on the right the awful locality last named being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze and left the vulgar to imagine if they could the full majesty of justice
there were only a couple of #woman# in the dock who were nodding to their admiring #friend# while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a #man# in plain clothes who leant over the #table#
a jailer stood reclining against the dock rail tapping his nose listlessly with a large key except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers by proclaiming #silence# or looked sternly up to bid some #woman# take that baby out when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries half smothered in the #mother# shawl from some meagre infant
there was an old smoky bust over the mantel shelf and a dusty clock above the dock the only #thing# present that seemed to go on as it ought for depravity or poverty or an habitual acquaintance with both had left a taint on all the animate #matter# hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it
$mr_noah_claypole$ looked eagerly about him for the dodger but although there were several #woman# who would have done very well for that distinguished character #mother# or sister and more than #one# #man# who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father nobody at all answering the description given him of $mr_john_dawkins$ was to be seen
he waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the #woman# being committed for trial went flaunting out and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit
it was indeed $mr_john_dawkins$ who shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual his left #hand# in his #pocket# and his #hat# in his right #hand# preceded the jailer with a rolling gait altogether indescribable and taking his #place# in the dock requested in an audible #voice# to know what he was placed in that ere disgraceful sitivation for
the #room# smelt close and unwholesome the walls were dirt discoloured and the ceiling blackened hold your tongue will you said the jailer
i an englishman aint i rejoined the dodger where are my priwileges you ll get your privileges soon enough retorted the jailer and pepper with em
we ll see wot the secretary of state for the home affairs has got to say to the beaks if i dont replied $mr_john_dawkins$
i shall thank the madg strates to dispose of this here little affair and not to keep me while they read the paper for i ve got an appointment with a genelman in the city and as i am a #man# of my #word# and wery punctual in business #matter# he ll go away if i aint there to my #time# and then pr aps ther wont be an action for damage against them as kep me away
at this point the dodger with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter desired the jailer to communicate the #name# of them two files as was on the bench
which so tickled the spectators that they laughed almost as heartily as #master# $charley_bates$ could have done if he had heard the request
now then wot is this here business oh no certainly not #silence# there cried the jailer what is this
inquired #one# of the magistrates a pick pocketing case your worship has the #boy# ever been here before he ought to have been a many #time# replied the jailer
he has been pretty well everywhere else i know him well your worship oh you know me do you cried the artful making a note of the statement
wery good that a case of deformation of character any #way# here there was another laugh and another cry of #silence#
now then where are the witnesses said the clerk ah that right added the dodger where are they i should like to see em
this wish was immediately gratified for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the #pocket# of an unknown #gentleman# in a crowd and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom which being a very old #one# he deliberately put back again after trying it on his own countenance
for this reason he took the dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him and the said dodger being searched had upon his #person# a silver snuff box with the owner #name# engraved upon the lid
this #gentleman# had been discovered on reference to the court guide and being then and there present swore that the snuff box was his and that he had missed it on the previous #day# the #moment# he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to
he had also remarked a young #gentleman# in the throng particularly active in making his #way# about and that young #gentleman# was the prisoner before him
have you #anything# to ask this witness #boy# said the magistrate i wouldnt abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him replied the dodger
do you hear his worship ask if you ve #anything# to say inquired the jailer nudging the silent dodger with his elbow
have you #anything# to say at all i beg your pardon said the dodger looking up with an #air# of abstraction
did you redress yourself to me my #man# i never see such an out and out young wagabond your worship observed the officer with a grin
no replied the dodger not here for this aint the shop for justice besides which my attorney is a breakfasting this #morning# with the wice president of the #house# of commons but i shall have #something# to say elsewhere and so will he and so will a wery numerous and spectable circle of acquaintance as ll make them beaks wish they never been born or that they got their footmen to hang em up to their own #hat# pegs afore they let em come out this #morning# to try it on upon me
do you mean to say #anything# you young shaver i ll there he fully committed interposed the clerk take him away
come on said the jailer oh ah i ll come on replied the dodger brushing his #hat# with the palm of his #hand#
ah to the bench it no use your looking frightened i wont show you no mercy not a ha porth of it
you ll pay for this my fine fellers i wouldnt be you for #something# i wouldnt go free now if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me
with these last #word# the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar threatening till he got into the yard to make a parliamentary business of it and then grinning in the officer #face# with great glee and self approval
having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell $mr_noah_claypole$ made the best of his #way# back to where he had left #master# $charley_bates$
after waiting here some #time# he was joined by that young #gentleman# who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat and ascertained that his new #friend# had not been followed by any impertinent #person#
the two hastened back together to bear to $mr_fagin$ the animating news that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringing up and establishing for himself a glorious reputation
here carry me off to prison take me away #chapter# xliv the #time# arrives for $miss_nancy$ to redeem her pledge to $miss_rose$ maylie
adept as she was in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation the #girl# $miss_nancy$ could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken wrought upon her #mind#
she remembered that both the crafty jew and the brutal $mr_william_sikes$ had confided to her schemes which had been hidden from all others in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion
vile as those schemes were desperate as were their originators and bitter as were her feelings towards $mr_fagin$ who had led her step by step deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery
whence was no escape still there were #time# when even towards him she felt some relenting lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded and he should fall at last richly as he merited such a fate by her #hand#
but these were the mere wanderings of a #mind# unable wholly to detach itself from old #companion# and associations though enabled to fix itself steadily on #one# object and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration
her fears for $mr_william_sikes$ would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet #time# but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery she had refused even for his sake a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her and what more could she do
though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion they forced themselves upon her again and again and left their traces too
at #time# she took no heed of what was passing before her or no #part# in conversations where once she would have been the loudest
at other #time# she laughed without merriment and was noisy without a #moment# afterwards she sat silent and dejected brooding with her #head# upon her #hand# while the very effort by which she roused herself told more forcibly than even these indications that she was ill at ease and that her #thought# were occupied with #matter# very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her #companion#
she fails she was resolved she grew pale and thin even within a few #day# it was sunday #night# and the bell of the nearest church struck the #hour#
$mr_william_sikes$ and the jew were talking but they paused to listen the #girl# looked up from the low seat on which she crouched and listened too
eleven an #hour# this #side# of midnight said $mr_william_sikes$ raising the blind to #look# out and returning to his seat
dark and heavy it is too a good #night# for business this ah replied $mr_fagin$ what a pity $bill_sikes$ my #dear# that there none quite ready to be done
you re right for once replied $mr_william_sikes$ gruffly it is a pity for i in the humour too $mr_fagin$ sighed and shook his #head# despondingly
we must make up for lost #time# when we ve got #thing# into a good train that all i know said $mr_william_sikes$
that the #way# to talk my #dear# replied $mr_fagin$ venturing to pat him on the shoulder it does me good to hear you
does you good does it cried $mr_william_sikes$ well so be it ha ha ha laughed $mr_fagin$ as if he were relieved by even this concession
i dont feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder so take it away said $mr_william_sikes$ casting off the jew #hand#
you re like yourself to #night# $bill_sikes$ quite like yourself it make you nervous $bill_sikes$ reminds you of being nabbed does it said $mr_fagin$ determined not to be offended
there never was another #man# with such a #face# as yours unless it was your father and i suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this #time# unless you came straight from the old un without any father at all betwixt you which i shouldnt wonder at a bit
$mr_fagin$ offered no reply to this compliment but pulling $mr_william_sikes$ by the sleeve pointed his finger towards $miss_nancy$ who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving the #room#
reminds me of being nabbed by the devil returned $mr_william_sikes$ hallo cried $mr_william_sikes$ nance where the gal going to at this #time# of #night#
not far what answer that retorted $mr_william_sikes$ do you hear me i dont know where replied the #girl#
then i do said $mr_william_sikes$ more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the #girl# going where she listed
nowhere sit down i not well i told you that before rejoined the #girl# i want a breath of #air#
put your #head# out of the winder replied $mr_william_sikes$ there not enough there said the #girl# i want it in the #street#
with which assurance he $miss_rose$ locked the #door# took the key out and pulling her bonnet from her #head# flung it up to the top of an old press
then you wont have it replied $mr_william_sikes$ there said the robber now stop quietly where you are will you
it not such a #matter# as a bonnet would keep me said the #girl# turning very pale what do you mean $bill_sikes$
do you know what you re doing know what i oh cried $mr_william_sikes$ turning to $mr_fagin$ she out of her senses you know or she darent talk to me in that #way#
you ll drive me on the #something# desperate muttered the #girl# placing both #hand# upon her breast as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak
let me go will you this #minute# this instant no said $mr_william_sikes$ tell him to let me go $mr_fagin$
he had better it ll be better for him do you hear me cried $miss_nancy$ stamping her #foot# upon the #ground#
and if i hear you for half a #minute# longer the #dog# shall have such a grip on your throat as ll #tear# some of that screaming #voice# out
hear you repeated $mr_william_sikes$ turning round in his #chair# to confront her aye wot has come over you you jade
wot is it let me go said the #girl# with great earnestness then sitting herself down on the floor before the #door# she said $bill_sikes$ let me go you dont know what you are doing
you dont indeed for only #one# #hour# do do cut my limbs off #one# by #one# cried $mr_william_sikes$ seizing her roughly by the #arm# if i dont think the gal stark raving mad
$mr_william_sikes$ looked on for a #minute# watching his opportunity and suddenly pinioning her #hand# dragged her struggling and wrestling with him by the #way# into a small #room# adjoining where he sat himself on a bench and thrusting her into a #chair# held her down by force
she struggled and implored by turns until twelve clock had struck and then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest the point any further
with a caution backed by many oaths to make no more efforts to go out that #night# $mr_william_sikes$ left her to recover at leisure and rejoined $mr_fagin$
get up not till you let me go not till you let me go never never screamed the #girl# whew said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his #face#
wot a precious strange gal that is you may say that $bill_sikes$ replied $mr_fagin$ thoughtfully you may say that wot did she take it into her #head# to go out to #night# for do you think asked $mr_william_sikes$
come you should know her better than me wot does it mean obstinacy #woman# obstinacy i suppose my #dear#
well i suppose it is growled $mr_william_sikes$ i #thought# i had tamed her but she as bad as ever
worse said $mr_fagin$ thoughtfully i never knew her like this for such a little cause nor i said $mr_william_sikes$
i think she got a touch of that fever in her blood yet and it wont come out eh like enough i ll let her a little blood without troubling the #doctor# if she took that #way# again said $mr_william_sikes$
she was hanging about me all #day# and #night# too when i was stretched on my back and you like a blackhearted wolf as you are kept yourself aloof said $mr_william_sikes$
we was poor too all the #time# and i think #one# #way# or other it worried and fretted her and that being shut up here so long has made her restless eh
$mr_fagin$ nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment that it my #dear# replied the jew in a whisper
her #eye# were swollen and red she rocked herself to and fro tossed her #head# and after a little #time# burst out laughing
hush as he uttered these #word# the #girl# herself appeared and resumed her former seat why now she on the other tack exclaimed $mr_william_sikes$ turning a #look# of excessive surprise on his #companion#
$mr_fagin$ nodded to him to take no further notice just then and in a few #minute# the #girl# subsided into her accustomed demeanour
he paused when he reached the #room# #door# and looking round asked if somebody would #light# him down the dark stairs
whispering $mr_william_sikes$ that there was no fear of her relapsing $mr_fagin$ took up his #hat# and bade him good #night# #light# him down said $mr_william_sikes$ who was filling his pipe
it a pity he should break his neck himself and disappoint the sight seers show him a #light# $miss_nancy$ followed the old #man# downstairs with a candle
when they reached the passage he laid his finger on his lip and drawing close to the #girl# said in a whisper
what is it $miss_nancy$ #dear# what do you mean replied the #girl# in the same tone the reason of all this replied $mr_fagin$
if he he pointed with his skinny fore finger up the stairs is so hard with you he a brute nance a brute beast why dont you
well said the #girl# as $mr_fagin$ paused with his mouth almost touching her ear and his #eye# looking into hers
no #matter# just now we ll talk of this again you have a #friend# in me nance a staunch #friend# i have the means at #hand# quiet and close
if you want revenge on those that treat you like a #dog# like a #dog# worse than his #dog# for he humours him sometimes come to me
i say come to me he is the mere hound of a #day# but you know me of old nance
she shrank back as $mr_fagin$ offered to lay his #hand# on hers but said good #night# again in a steady #voice# and answering his parting #look# with a nod of intelligence closed the #door# between them
i know you well replied the #girl# without manifesting the least emotion good #night# $mr_fagin$ walked towards his home intent upon the #thought# that were working within his brain
he had conceived the idea not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him but slowly and by degrees that $miss_nancy$ wearied of the housebreaker brutality had conceived an attachment for some new #friend#
her altered #manner# her repeated absences from home alone her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous and added to these her desperate impatience to leave home that #night# at a particular #hour# all favoured the supposition and rendered it to him at least almost #matter# of certainty
he would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as $miss_nancy$ and must thus $mr_fagin$ argued be secured without delay
the object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons there was another and a darker object to be gained
the #girl# must know well that if she shook him off she could never be safe from his fury and that it would be surely wreaked to the maiming of limbs or perhaps the loss of #life# on the object of her more recent fancy
$mr_william_sikes$ knew too much and his ruffian taunts had not galled $mr_fagin$ the less because the wounds were hidden with a little persuasion #thought# $mr_fagin$ what more likely than that she would consent to poison him
there would be the dangerous villain the #man# i hate gone another secured in his #place# and my influence over the #girl# with a knowledge of this crime to back it unlimited
these #thing# passed through the #mind# of $mr_fagin$ during the short #time# he sat alone in the housebreaker #room# and with them uppermost in his #thought# he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of sounding the #girl# in the broken hints he threw out at parting
#woman# have done such #thing# and worse to secure the same object before now there was no expression of surprise no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning
but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the #life# of $mr_william_sikes$ and that was #one# of the chief ends to be attained
the #girl# clearly comprehended it her glance at parting showed that how #thought# $mr_fagin$ as he crept homeward can i increase my influence with her
if without extracting a confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to $mr_william_sikes$ of whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs could he not secure her compliance
what new power can i acquire such brains are fertile in expedients i can said $mr_fagin$ almost aloud she durst not refuse me then
not for her #life# not for her #life# i have it all the means are ready and shall be set to work
he cast back a dark #look# and a threatening motion of the #hand# towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain and went on his #way# busying his bony #hand# in the folds of his tattered garment which he wrenched tightly in his grasp as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers
the old #man# was up betimes next #morning# and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate who after a delay that seemed interminable at #length# presented himself and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast
i shall have you yet #chapter# xlv $mr_noah_claypole$ is employed by $mr_fagin$ on a secret mission bolter said $mr_fagin$ drawing up a #chair# and seating himself opposite $mr_morris_bolter$
well here i am returned $mr_noah_claypole$ what the #matter# dont yer ask me to do #anything# till i have done eating
you can talk as you eat cant you said $mr_fagin$ cursing his #dear# young #friend# greediness from the very bottom of his #heart#
that a great fault in this #place# yer never get #time# enough over yer meals oh yes i can talk i get on better when i talk said $mr_noah_claypole$ cutting a monstrous slice of bread
where $charlotte$ out said $mr_fagin$ i sent her out this #morning# with the other young #woman# because i wanted us to be alone
oh said $mr_noah_claypole$ i wish yer ordered her to make some buttered toast first well talk away yer wont interrupt me
there seemed indeed no great fear of #anything# interrupting him as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business
you did well yesterday my #dear# said $mr_fagin$ beautiful six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first #day# the kinchin lay will be a fortune to you
dont you forget to add three pint pots and a milk can said $mr_morris_bolter$ no no my #dear# the pint pots were great strokes of genius but the milk can was a perfect masterpiece
pretty well i think for a beginner remarked $mr_morris_bolter$ complacently the pots i took off airy railings and the milk can was standing by itself outside a public #house#
$mr_fagin$ affected to laugh very heartily and $mr_morris_bolter$ having had his laugh out took a series of large bites which finished his first hunk of bread and butter and assisted himself to a second
i want you bolter said $mr_fagin$ leaning over the #table# to do a piece of work for me my #dear# that needs great care and caution
i #thought# it might get rusty with the rain or catch cold yer know eh ha ha ha i say rejoined bolter dont yer go shoving me into danger or sending me any more yer police offices
that dont suit me that dont and so i tell yer that not the smallest danger in it not the very smallest said the jew it only to dodge a #woman#
an old #woman# demanded $mr_morris_bolter$ a young #one# replied $mr_fagin$ i can do that pretty well i know said bolter
not to not to do #anything# but to tell me where she goes who she sees and if possible what she says to remember the #street# if it is a #street# or the #house# if it is a #house# and to bring me back all the information you can
i was a regular cunning sneak when i was at school what am i to dodge her for what ll yer give me asked $mr_noah_claypole$ setting down his cup and looking his employer eagerly in the #face#
if you do it well a pound my #dear# #one# pound said $mr_fagin$ wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible
and that what i never gave yet for any job of work where there wasnt valuable consideration to be gained
who is she inquired $mr_noah_claypole$ #one# of us oh lor cried $mr_noah_claypole$ curling up his nose yer doubtful of her are yer
she has found out some new #friend# my #dear# and i must know who they are replied $mr_fagin$ i see said $mr_noah_claypole$
just to have the pleasure of knowing them if they re respectable #people# eh ha ha ha i your #man# i knew you would be cried $mr_fagin$ elated by the success of his proposal
of course of course replied $mr_noah_claypole$ where is she where am i to wait for her where am i to go
all that my #dear# you shall hear from me i ll point her out at the proper #time# said $mr_fagin$
that #night# and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter dress ready to turn out at a #word# from $mr_fagin$
six #night# passed six long weary #night# and on each $mr_fagin$ came home with a disappointed #face# and briefly intimated that it was not yet #time#
you keep ready and leave the rest to me on the seventh he returned earlier and with an exultation he could not conceal
she goes abroad to #night# said $mr_fagin$ and on the right errand i sure for she has been alone all #day# and the #man# she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak
$mr_noah_claypole$ started up without saying a #word# for the jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him
they left the #house# stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of #street# arrived at #length# before a public #house# which $mr_noah_claypole$ recognised as the same in which he had slept on the #night# of his arrival in london
it was sunday come with me quick it was past eleven clock and the #door# was closed it opened softly on its hinges as $mr_fagin$ gave a low whistle
scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for #word# $mr_fagin$ and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of glass to $mr_noah_claypole$ and signed to him to climb up and observe the #person# in the adjoining #room#
they entered without noise and the #door# was closed behind them is that the #woman# he asked scarcely above his breath
$mr_fagin$ nodded yes i cant see her #face# well whispered $mr_noah_claypole$ she is looking down and the candle is behind her
in an instant the lad entered the #room# adjoining and under pretence of snuffing the candle moved it in the required position and speaking to the #girl# caused her to raise her #face#
stay there whispered $mr_fagin$ he signed to $barney$ who withdrew i see her now cried the spy plainly i should know her among a thousand
$mr_fagin$ drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and they held their breaths as she passed within a few #foot# of their #place# of concealment and emerged by the #door# at which they had entered
he hastily descended as the #room# #door# opened and the #girl# came out hist cried the lad who held the #door#
dow $mr_noah_claypole$ exchanged a #look# with $mr_fagin$ and darted out to the left whispered the lad take the left had and keep od the other #side#
he did so and by the #light# of the lamps saw the #girl# retreating figure already at some distance before him
he advanced as near as he considered prudent and kept on the opposite #side# of the #street# the better to observe her motions
she looked nervously round twice or thrice and once stopped to let two #man# who were following close behind her pass on
she seemed to gather courage as she advanced and to walk with a steadier and firmer step the spy preserved the same relative distance between them and followed with his #eye# upon her
#one# which advanced with a swift and rapid step was that of a #woman# who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object the other figure was that of a #man# who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance accommodated his pace to hers stopping when she stopped and as she moved again creeping stealthily on but never allowing himself in the ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps
thus they crossed the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the #woman# apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the #foot# passengers turned back
the movement was sudden but he who watched her was not thrown off his guard by it for shrinking into #one# of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement
when she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed her again
#chapter# xlvi the appointment kept the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures emerged on london bridge at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped
the #man# stopped too it was a very dark #night# the #day# had been unfavourable and at that #hour# and #place# there were few #people# stirring
such as there were hurried quickly past very possibly without seeing but certainly without noticing either the #woman# or the #man# who kept her in view
their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of london destitute population as chanced to take their #way# over the bridge that #night# in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their #head# they stood there in #silence# neither speaking nor spoken to by any #one# who passed
a mist hung over the river deepening the red glare of the #fire# that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks
the old smoke stained storehouses on either #side# $miss_rose$ heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon #water# too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes
the tower of old saint saviour church and the spire of saint magnus so long the giant warders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom but the forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of churches above were nearly all hidden from sight
the #girl# had taken a few restless turns to and fro closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer when the heavy bell of st paul tolled for the #death# of another #day#
the palace the #night# cellar the jail the madhouse the chambers of birth and #death# of health and sickness the rigid #face# of the corpse and the calm sleep of the #child# midnight was upon them all
the #hour# had not struck two #minute# when a young #lady# accompanied by a grey haired #gentleman# alighted from a hackney carriage within a short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked straight towards it
midnight had come upon the crowded city they had scarcely set #foot# upon its pavement when the #girl# started and immediately made towards them
they walked onward looking about them with the #air# of #person# who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate
they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it immediately for a #man# in the garments of a countryman came close up brushed against them indeed at that precise #moment#
not here said $miss_nancy$ hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here come away out of the public road down the steps yonder
as she uttered these #word# and indicated with her #hand# the direction in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on
the steps to which the #girl# had pointed were those which on the surrey bank and on the same #side# of the bridge as saint saviour church form a landing stairs from the river
to this spot the #man# bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved and after a #moment# survey of the #place# he began to descend
just below the end of the second going down the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames
at this point the lower steps widen so that a #person# turning that angle of the wall is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him if only a step
the countryman looked hastily round when he reached this point and as there seemed no better #place# of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty of #room# he slipped aside with his back to the pilaster and there waited pretty certain that they would come no lower and that even if he could not hear what was said he could follow them again with safety
so tardily stole the #time# in this lonely #place# and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect that he more than once gave the #matter# up for lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation
he was on the point of emerging from his hiding #place# and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and directly afterwards of #voice# almost close at his ear
these stairs are a #part# of the bridge they consist of three flights he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely breathing listened attentively
this is far enough said a #voice# which was evidently that of the #gentleman# i will not suffer the young #lady# to go any farther
many #people# would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but you see i am willing to humour you to humour me cried the #voice# of the #girl# whom he had followed
why for what said the #gentleman# in a kinder tone for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange #place#
why not have let me speak to you above there where it is #light# and there is #something# stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole
you re considerate indeed #sir# to humour me well well it no #matter# i told you before replied $miss_nancy$ that i was afraid to speak to you there
i dont know why it is said the #girl# shuddering but i have such a fear and dread upon me to #night# that i can hardly stand
a fear of what asked the #gentleman# who seemed to pity her i scarcely know of what replied the #girl#
horrible #thought# of #death# and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that has made me burn as if i was on #fire# have been upon me all #day#
i was reading a #book# to #night# to wile the #time# away and the same #thing# came into the print imagination said the #gentleman# soothing her
i ll swear i saw coffin written in every page of the #book# in large black letters aye and they carried #one# close to me in the #street# to #night#
i wish i did no imagination replied the #girl# in a hoarse #voice# there is #nothing# unusual in that said the #gentleman#
there was #something# so uncommon in her #manner# that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the #girl# utter these #word# and the blood chilled within him
he had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet #voice# of the young #lady# as she begged her to be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies
they have passed me often real #one# rejoined the #girl# this was not speak to her kindly said the young #lady# to her #companion#
your haughty religious #people# would have held their #head# up to see me as i am to #night# and preached of flames and vengeance cried the #girl#
oh #dear# #lady# why ar nt those who claim to be god own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud instead of so much humbler
a turk turns his #face# after washing it well to the east when he says his prayers these good #people# after giving their #face# such a rub against the world as to take the smiles off turn with no less regularity to the darkest #side# of heaven
poor creature she seems to need it ah said the #gentleman# between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first
these #word# appeared to be addressed to the young #lady# and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording $miss_nancy$ #time# to recover herself
the #gentleman# shortly afterwards addressed himself to her you were not here last sunday #night# he said i couldnt come replied $miss_nancy$
you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to #night# i hope asked the old #gentleman#
i was kept by force by whom him that i told the young #lady# of before no replied the #girl# shaking her #head#
it not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why i couldnt give him a drink of laudanum before i came away
did he awake before you returned inquired the #gentleman# no and neither he nor any of them suspect me
good said the #gentleman# now listen to me i am ready replied the #girl# as he paused for a #moment#
this young #lady# the #gentleman# began has communicated to me and to some other #friend# who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly a fortnight since
i confess to you that i had doubts at first whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe you are
to prove to you that i am disposed to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the secret whatever it may be from the fear of this #man# monks
but if if said the #gentleman# he cannot be secured or if secured cannot be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew
i am said the #girl# earnestly i repeat that i firmly believe it $mr_fagin$ cried the #girl# recoiling that #man# must be delivered up by you said the #gentleman#
i will not do it i will never do it replied the #girl# devil that he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that
you will not said the #gentleman# who seemed fully prepared for this answer never returned the #girl# tell me why
for #one# reason rejoined the #girl# firmly for #one# reason that the #lady# knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her promise and for this other reason besides that bad #life# as he has led i have led a bad #life# too there are many of us who have kept the same courses together and i ll not turn upon them who might any of them have turned upon me but didnt bad as they are
then said the #gentleman# quickly as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain put monks into my #hand# and leave him to me to deal with
what if he turns against the others i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him there the #matter# will rest there must be circumstances in $oliver_twist$ little history which it would be painful to drag before the public #eye# and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free
and if it is not suggested the #girl# then pursued the #gentleman# this $mr_fagin$ shall not be brought to justice without your consent
in such a case i could show you reasons i think which would induce you to yield it have i the #lady# promise for that asked the #girl#
you have replied $miss_rose$ my true and faithful pledge monks would never learn how you knew what you do said the #girl# after a short pause
never replied the #gentleman# the intelligence should be brought to bear upon him that he could never even guess
i have been a liar and among liars from a little #child# said the #girl# after another interval of #silence# but i will take your #word#
after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so she proceeded in a #voice# so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by #name# and situation the public #house# whence
from the #manner# in which she occasionally paused it appeared as if the #gentleman# were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated
when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the #place# the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation and the #night# and #hour# on which monks was most in the habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider for a few #moment# for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection
he is tall said the #girl# and a strongly made #man# but not stout he has a lurking walk and as he walks constantly #look# over his shoulder first on #one# #side# and then on the other
dont forget that for his #eye# are sunk in his #head# so much deeper than any other #man# that you might almost tell him by that alone
his #face# is dark like his hair and #eye# and although he cant be more than six or eight and twenty withered and haggard
his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth for he has desperate fits and sometimes even bites his #hand# and covers them with wounds why did you start said the #girl# stopping suddenly
the #gentleman# replied in a hurried #manner# that he was not conscious of having done so and begged her to proceed
#part# of this said the #girl# i have drawn out from other #people# at the #house# i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both #time# he was covered up in a large cloak
she had been followed that #night# i think that all i can give you to know him by stay though she added
upon his throat so high that you can see a #part# of it below his neckerchief when he turns his #face# there is a broad red mark like a burn or scald cried the #gentleman#
the young #lady# uttered a cry of surprise and for a few #moment# they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe
how this said the #girl# you know him i think i do said the #gentleman# breaking #silence# i should by your description
as he expressed himself to this effect with assumed carelessness he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter it must be he
now he said returning so it seemed by the sound to the spot where he had stood before you have given us most valuable assistance young #woman# and i wish you to be the better for it
we shall see many #people# are singularly like each other it may not be the same what can i do to serve you
you will not persist in saying that rejoined the #gentleman# with a #voice# and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate #heart#
#nothing# replied $miss_nancy$ think now tell me #nothing# #sir# rejoined the #girl# weeping you can do #nothing# to help me
the past has been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies mis spent and such priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows
i am past all hope indeed you put yourself beyond its pale said the #gentleman# but once and never grants again but for the future you may hope
i do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of #heart# and #mind# for that must come as you seek it but a quiet asylum either in england or if you fear to remain here in some foreign country it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you
before the dawn of #morning# before this river wakes to the first glimpse of #day# #light# you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you as if you were to disappear from the earth this #moment#
i would not have you go back to exchange #one# #word# with any old #companion# or take #one# #look# at any old haunt or breathe the very #air# which is pestilence and #death# to you
come quit them all while there is #time# and opportunity she will be persuaded now cried the young #lady# she hesitates i am sure
i fear not my #dear# said the #gentleman# no #sir# i do not replied the #girl# after a short struggle
i am chained to my old #life# i loathe and hate it now but i cannot leave it i must have gone too far to turn
back and yet i dont know for if you had spoken to me so some #time# ago i should have laughed it off
but she said looking hastily round this fear comes over me again i must go home home repeated the young #lady# with great stress upon the #word#
home #lady# rejoined the #girl# to such a home as i have raised for myself with the work of my whole #life#
if i have done you any service all i ask is that you leave me and let me go my #way# alone
let us #part# i shall be watched or seen go go it is useless said the #gentleman# with a sigh
we compromise her safety perhaps by staying here we may have detained her longer than she expected already yes yes urged the #girl#
you have what cried the young #lady# can be the end of this poor creature #life# what repeated the #girl#
how many #time# do you read of such as i who spring into the tide and leave no living #thing# to care for or bewail them
#look# before you #lady# #look# at that dark #water# it may be #year# hence or it may be only months but i shall come to that at last
do not speak thus pray returned the young #lady# sobbing it will never reach your ears #dear# #lady# and god forbid such horrors should replied the #girl#
good #night# good #night# the #gentleman# turned away this purse cried the young #lady# take it for my sake that you may have some resource in an #hour# of need and trouble
no replied the #girl# i have not done this for money let me have that to think of and yet give me #something# that you have worn i should like to have #something# no no not a ring
your gloves or handkerchief #anything# that i can keep as having belonged to you sweet #lady# there bless you god bless you
the violent agitation of the #girl# and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill usage and violence seemed to determine the #gentleman# to leave her as she requested
good #night# good #night# the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the #voice# ceased the two figures of the young #lady# and her #companion# soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge
they stopped at the summit of the stairs hark cried the young #lady# listening did she call i #thought# i heard her #voice#
no my love replied $mr_brownlow$ looking sadly back she has not moved and will not till we are gone
as they disappeared the #girl# sunk down nearly at her full #length# upon #one# of the stone stairs and vented the anguish of her #heart# in bitter #tear#
$miss_rose$ maylie lingered but the old #gentleman# drew her #arm# through his and led her with gentle force away after a #time# she arose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the #street#
the astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some #minute# afterwards and having ascertained with many cautious glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his hiding #place# and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in the same #manner# as he had descended
peeping out more than once when he reached the top to make sure that he was unobserved $mr_noah_claypole$ darted away at his utmost speed and made for the jew #house# as fast as his legs would carry him
it was nearly two #hour# before #day# break that #time# which in the autumn of the #year# may be truly called the dead of #night# when the #street# are silent and deserted when even sounds appear to slumber and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream it was at this still and silent #hour# that $mr_fagin$ sat watching in his old lair with #face# so distorted and pale and #eye# so red and blood shot that he looked less like a #man# than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and worried by an evil spirit
he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet with his #face# turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a #table# by his #side#
his right #hand# was raised to his lips and as absorbed in #thought# he hit his long black nails he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a #dog# or rat
towards him the old #man# sometimes directed his #eye# for an instant and then brought them back again to the candle which with a long burnt wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon the #table# plainly showed that his #thought# were busy elsewhere
#chapter# xlvii fatal consequences stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay $mr_noah_claypole$ fast asleep indeed they were mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme
hatred of the #girl# who had dared to palter with strangers and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on $mr_william_sikes$ the fear of detection and ruin and #death# and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all these were the passionate considerations which following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain of $mr_fagin$ as every evil #thought# and blackest purpose lay working at his #heart#
he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take the smallest heed of #time# until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the #street#
he crept upstairs to the #door# and presently returned accompanied by a #man# muffled to the chin who carried a bundle under #one# #arm#
at last he muttered wiping his dry and fevered mouth at last the bell rang gently as he spoke sitting down and throwing back his outer coat the #man# displayed the burly frame of $mr_william_sikes$
there he said laying the bundle on the #table# take care of that and do the most you can with it
it been trouble enough to get i #thought# i should have been here three #hour# ago $mr_fagin$ laid his #hand# upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard sat down again without speaking
but he did not take his #eye# off the robber for an instant during this action and now that they sat over against each other #face# to #face# he looked fixedly at him with his lips quivering so violently and his #face# so altered by the emotions which had mastered him that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his #chair# and surveyed him with a #look# of real affright
$mr_fagin$ raised his right #hand# and shook his trembling forefinger in the #air# but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the #moment# gone
wot now cried $mr_william_sikes$ wot do you #look# at a #man# so for damme said $mr_william_sikes$ feeling in his breast with a #look# of alarm
he gone mad i must #look# to myself here no no rejoined $mr_fagin$ finding his #voice# it not you re not the #person# $bill_sikes$
oh you havent havent you said $mr_william_sikes$ looking sternly at him and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient #pocket#
i ve no no fault to find with you that lucky for #one# of us which #one# that is dont #matter#
i ve got that to tell you $bill_sikes$ said $mr_fagin$ drawing his #chair# nearer will make you worse than me aye returned the robber with an incredulous #air#
tell away #look# sharp or nance will think i lost lost cried $mr_fagin$ she has pretty well settled that in her own #mind# already
$mr_william_sikes$ looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jew #face# and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched his coat collar in his huge #hand# and shook him soundly
speak will you he said or if you dont it shall be for want of breath open your mouth and say wot you ve got to say in plain #word#
out with it you thundering old cur out with it suppose that lad that laying there $mr_fagin$ began $mr_william_sikes$ turned round to where $mr_noah_claypole$ was sleeping as if he had not previously observed him
suppose that lad pursued $mr_fagin$ was to peach to blow upon us all first seeking out the right folks for the purpose and then having a meeting with em in the #street# to paint our likenesses describe every mark that they might know us by and the crib where we might be most easily taken
suppose he was to do all this and besides to blow upon a plant we ve all been in more or less of his own fancy not grabbed trapped tried earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread
and #water# but of his own fancy to please his own taste stealing out at #night# to find those most interested against us and peaching to them
well he said resuming his former position do you hear me cried the jew his #eye# flashing with rage
if he was left alive till i came i grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his #head#
suppose he did all this what then what then replied $mr_william_sikes$ with a tremendous oath what if i did it cried $mr_fagin$ almost in a yell
i that knows so much and could hang so many besides myself i dont know replied $mr_william_sikes$ clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion
i do #something# in the jail that ud get me put in irons and if i was tried along with you i fall upon you with them in the open court and beat your brains out afore the #people#
i should have such strength muttered the robber poising his brawny #arm# that i could smash your #head# as if a loaded waggon had gone over it
you would would i said the housebreaker try me if it was $charley_bates$ or the dodger or bet or
$mr_fagin$ looked hard at the robber and motioning him to be silent stooped over the #bed# upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse him
$mr_william_sikes$ leant forward in his #chair# looking on with his #hand# upon his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in
i dont care who replied $mr_william_sikes$ impatiently whoever it was i serve them the same bolter bolter poor lad said $mr_fagin$ looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis
he tired tired with watching for her so long watching for her $bill_sikes$ wot ye mean asked $mr_william_sikes$ drawing back $mr_fagin$ made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him into a sitting posture
when his assumed #name# had been repeated several #time# $mr_noah_claypole$ rubbed his #eye# and giving a heavy yawn looked sleepily about him
tell me that again once again just for him to hear said the jew pointing to $mr_william_sikes$ as he spoke tell yer what asked the sleepy $mr_noah_claypole$ shaking himself pettishly
that about $miss_nancy$ said $mr_fagin$ clutching $mr_william_sikes$ by the wrist as if to prevent his leaving the #house# before he had heard enough
a #gentleman# and a #lady# that she had gone to of her own accord before who asked her to give up all her pals and monks first which she did and to describe him which she did and to tell her what #house# it was that we meet at and go to which she did and where it could be best watched from which she did and what #time# the #people# went there which she did
you followed her yes to london bridge yes where she met two #people# so she did she did all this
she told it all every #word# without a threat without a murmur she did did she not cried $mr_fagin$ half mad with fury
all right replied $mr_noah_claypole$ scratching his #head# that just what it was what did they say about last sunday
cried $mr_fagin$ tightening his grasp on $mr_william_sikes$ and brandishing his other #hand# aloft as the foam flew from his lips
they asked her said $mr_noah_claypole$ who as he grew more wakeful seemed to have a dawning perception who $mr_william_sikes$ was they asked her why she didnt come last sunday as she promised
about last sunday replied $mr_noah_claypole$ considering why i told yer that before again tell it again she said she couldnt
tell him that because she was forcibly kept at home by $bill_sikes$ the #man# she had told them of before replied $mr_noah_claypole$
why why what more of him cried $mr_fagin$ what more of the #man# she had told them of before tell him that tell him that
why that she couldnt very easily get out of #door# unless he knew where she was going to said $mr_noah_claypole$
and so the first #time# she went to see the #lady# she ha ha ha it made me laugh when she said it that it did she gave him a drink of laudanum
hell #fire# cried $mr_william_sikes$ breaking fiercely from the jew let me go flinging the old #man# from him he rushed from the #room# and darted wildly and furiously up the stairs
the #word# would not have been exchanged but that the housebreaker was unable to open the #door# on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence when the jew came panting up
$bill_sikes$ bill cried $mr_fagin$ following him hastily a #word# only a #word# let me out said $mr_william_sikes$ dont speak to me it not safe
let me out i say hear me speak a #word# rejoined $mr_fagin$ laying his #hand# upon the lock you wont be
well replied the other you wont be too violent $bill_sikes$ the #day# was breaking and there was #light# enough for the #man# to see each other #face#
they exchanged #one# brief glance there was a #fire# in the #eye# of both which could not be mistaken i mean said $mr_fagin$ showing that he felt all disguise was now useless not too violent for safety
$mr_william_sikes$ made no reply but pulling open the #door# of which $mr_fagin$ had turned the lock dashed into the silent #street#
without #one# pause or #moment# consideration without once turning his #head# to the right or left or raising his #eye# to the sky or lowering them to the #ground# but looking straight before him with savage resolution his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin
the robber held on his headlong course nor muttered a #word# nor relaxed a muscle until he reached his own #door#
he opened it softly with a key strode lightly up the stairs and entering his own #room# double locked the #door# and lifting a heavy #table# against it drew back the curtain of the #bed#
be crafty $bill_sikes$ and not too bold the #girl# was lying half dressed upon it he had roused her from her sleep for she raised herself with a hurried and startled #look#
get up said the #man# it is you $bill_sikes$ said the #girl# with an expression of pleasure at his return
it is was the reply get up there was a candle burning but the #man# hastily drew it from the candlestick and hurled it under the grate
seeing the faint #light# of early #day# without the #girl# $miss_rose$ to undraw the curtain let it be said $mr_william_sikes$ thrusting his #hand# before her
there enough #light# for wot i ve got to do $bill_sikes$ said the #girl# in the low #voice# of alarm why do you #look# like that at me
the robber sat regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils and heaving breast and then grasping her by the #head# and throat dragged her into the middle of the #room# and looking once towards the #door# placed his heavy #hand# upon her mouth
$bill_sikes$ bill gasped the #girl# wrestling with the strength of mortal fear i i wont scream or cry not once hear me speak to me tell me what i have done
you know you she devil returned the robber suppressing his breath you were watched to #night# every #word# you said was heard
then spare my #life# for the love of heaven as i spared yours rejoined the #girl# clinging to him $bill_sikes$ #dear# $bill_sikes$ you cannot have the #heart# to kill me
you shall have #time# to think and save yourself this crime i will not loose my hold you cannot throw me off
oh think of all i have given up only this #one# #night# for you $bill_sikes$ bill for #dear# god sake for your own for mine stop before you spill my blood
the #man# struggled violently to release his #arm# but those of the #girl# were clasped round his and #tear# her as he would he could not #tear# them away
$bill_sikes$ cried the #girl# striving to lay her #head# upon his breast the #gentleman# and that #dear# #lady# told me to #night# of a home in some foreign country where i could end my #day# in solitude and peace
let me see them again and beg them on my knees to show the same mercy and goodness to you and let us both leave this dreadful #place# and far apart lead better #life# and forget how we have lived except in prayers and never see each other more
i have been true to you upon my guilty soul i have it is never too late to repent they told me so i feel it now but we must have #time# a little little #time#
the certainty of immediate detection if he fired flashed across his #mind# even in the midst of his fury and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon upon the upturned #face# that almost touched his own
she staggered and fell nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead but raising herself with difficulty on her knees drew from her bosom a white handkerchief
$miss_rose$ maylie own and holding it up in her folded #hand# as high towards heaven as her feeble strength would allow breathed #one# prayer for mercy to her maker
the murderer staggering backward to the wall and shutting out the sight with his #hand# seized a heavy club and struck her down
the housebreaker freed #one# #arm# and grasped his pistol it was a ghastly figure to #look# upon #chapter# xlviii the flight of $mr_william_sikes$
of all bad deeds that under cover of the darkness had been committed within wide london bounds since #night# hung over it that was the worst
of all the horrors that $miss_rose$ with an ill scent upon the #morning# #air# that was the foulest and most cruel
the sun the bright sun that brings back not #light# alone but new #life# and hope and freshness to #man# burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory
through costly coloured glass and paper mended #window# through cathedral dome and rotten crevice it shed its equal ray it lighted up the #room# where the murdered #woman# lay
if the sight had been a ghastly #one# in the dull #morning# what was it now in all that brilliant #light#
it did he tried to shut it out but it would stream in he had not moved he had been afraid to stir
there had been a moan and motion of the #hand# and with terror added to rage he had struck and struck again
once he threw a rug over it but it was worse to fancy the #eye# and imagine them moving towards him than to see them glaring upward as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling
he had plucked it off again and there was the body mere flesh and blood no more but such flesh and so much blood
there was hair upon the end which blazed and shrunk into a #light# cinder and caught by the #air# whirled up the chimney
even that frightened him sturdy as he was but he held the weapon till it broke and then piled it on the coals to burn away and smoulder into ashes
he washed himself and rubbed his clothes there were spots that would not be removed but he cut the pieces out and burnt them
he struck a #light# kindled a #fire# and thrust the club into it how those stains were dispersed about the #room#
the very #foot# of the #dog# were bloody all this #time# he had never once turned his back upon the corpse no not for a #moment#
such preparations completed he moved backward towards the #door# dragging the #dog# with him lest he should soil his #foot# anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the #street#
he shut the #door# softly locked it took the key and left the #house# he crossed over and glanced up at the #window# to be sure that #nothing# was visible from the outside
there was the curtain still drawn which she would have opened to admit the #light# she never saw again it lay nearly under there
he knew that god how the sun poured down upon the very spot the glance was instantaneous it was a relief to have got free of the #room#
he went through islington strode up the hill at highgate on which stands the stone in honour of whittington turned down to highgate hill unsteady of purpose and uncertain where to go struck off to the right again almost as soon as he began to descend it and taking the #foot# path across the fields skirted caen wood and so came on hampstead heath
traversing the hollow by the vale of heath he mounted the opposite bank and crossing the road which joins the villages of hampstead and highgate made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at north end in #one# of which he laid himself down under a hedge and slept
soon he was up again and away not far into the country but back towards london by the high road then back again then over another #part# of the same #ground# as he already traversed then wandering up and down in fields and lying on ditches brinks to rest and starting up to make for some other spot and do the same and ramble on again
he whistled on the #dog# and walked rapidly away where could he go that was near and not too public to get some meat and drink
thither he directed his steps running sometimes and sometimes with a strange perversity loitering at a snail pace or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick
hendon that was a good #place# not far off and out of most #people# #way# but when he got there all the #people# he met the very #child# at the #door# seemed to view him with suspicion
back he turned again without the courage to purchase bit or drop though he had tasted no food for many #hour# and once more he lingered on the heath uncertain where to go
#morning# and noon had passed and the #day# was on the wane and still he rambled to and fro and up and down and round and round and still lingered about the same spot
he wandered over miles and miles of #ground# and still came back to the old #place# at last he got away and shaped his course for hatfield
it was nine clock at #night# when the #man# quite tired out and the #dog# limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village and plodding along the little #street# crept into a small public #house# whose scanty #light# had guided them to the spot
they made #room# for the stranger but he sat down in the furthest #corner# and ate and drank alone or rather with his #dog# to whom he cast a morsel of food from #time# to #time#
the conversation of the #man# assembled here turned upon the neighbouring land and farmers and when those topics were exhausted upon the age of some old #man# who had been buried on the previous sunday the young #man# present considering him very old and the old #man# present declaring him to have been quite young not older #one# white haired grandfather said than he was with ten or fifteen #year# of #life# in him at least if he had taken care if he had taken care
there was a #fire# in the tap #room# and some country labourers were drinking before it there was #nothing# to attract attention or excite alarm in this
the robber after paying his reckoning sat silent and unnoticed in his #corner# and had almost dropped asleep when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer
this was an antic fellow half pedlar and half mountebank who travelled about the country on #foot# to vend hones strops razors washballs harness paste medicine for #dog# and horses cheap perfumery cosmetics and such like wares which he carried in a case slung to his back
his entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen which slackened not until he had made his supper and opened his box of treasures when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement
and what be that stoof good to eat $harry_maylie$ asked a grinning countryman pointing to some composition cakes in #one# #corner#
this said the fellow producing #one# this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain rust dirt mildew spick speck spot or spatter from silk satin linen cambric cloth crape stuff carpet merino muslin bombazeen or woollen stuff
wine stains fruit stains beer stains #water# stains paint stains pitch stains any stains all come out at #one# rub with the infallible and invaluable composition if a #lady# stains her honour she has only need to swallow #one# cake
if a #gentleman# wants to prove this he has only need to bolt #one# little square and he has put it beyond question for it quite as satisfactory as a pistol bullet and a great deal nastier in the flavour consequently the more credit in taking it
and she cured at once for it poison #one# penny a square with all these virtues #one# penny a square there were two buyers directly and more of the listeners plainly hesitated
the vendor observing this increased in loquacity it all bought up as fast as it can be made said the fellow
there are fourteen #water# mills six steam engines and a galvanic battery always a working upon it and they cant make it fast enough though the #man# work so hard that they die off and the widows is pensioned directly with twenty pound a #year# for each of the #child# and a premium of fifty for twins
#one# penny a square two half pence is all the same and four farthings is received with joy #one# penny a square
here is a stain upon the #hat# of a #gentleman# in company that i ll take clean out before he can order me a pint of ale
i ll take it clean out #sir# replied the #man# winking to the company before you can come across the #room# to get it
wine stains fruit stains beer stains #water# stains paint stains pitch stains mud stains blood stains hah cried $mr_william_sikes$ starting up give that back #gentleman# all observe the dark stain upon this #gentleman# #hat# no wider than a shilling but thicker than a half crown
whether it is a wine stain fruit stain beer stain #water# stain paint stain pitch stain mud stain or blood stain the #man# got no further for $mr_william_sikes$ with a hideous imprecation overthrew the #table# and tearing the #hat# from him burst out of the #house#
with the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him despite himself all #day# the murderer finding that he was not followed and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow turned back up the town and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage coach that was standing in the #street# was walking past when he recognised the mail from london and saw that it was standing at the little post office
he almost knew what was to come but he crossed over and listened the guard was standing at the #door# waiting for the letter bag
a #man# dressed like a game keeper came up at the #moment# and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement
that for your #people# said the guard now #look# alive in there will you damn that ere bag it warnt ready #night# afore last this wont do you know
#anything# new up in town ben asked the game keeper drawing back to the #window# shutters the better to admire the horses
no #nothing# that i knows on replied the #man# pulling on his gloves corn up a little i heerd talk of a murder too down spitalfields #way# but i dont reckon much upon it
oh that quite true said a #gentleman# inside who was looking out of the #window# and a dreadful murder it was
was it #sir# rejoined the guard touching his #hat# #man# or #woman# pray #sir# a #woman# replied the #gentleman#
it is supposed now ben replied the coachman impatiently damn that ere bag said the guard are you gone to sleep in there
ah and so the young ooman of property that going to take a fancy to me but i dont know when
coming cried the office keeper running out coming growled the guard here give hold all ri ight the horn sounded a few cheerful notes and the coach was gone
$mr_william_sikes$ remained standing in the #street# apparently unmoved by what he had just heard and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go
he went on doggedly but as he left the town behind him and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core
every object before him substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some fearful #thing# but these fears were #nothing# compared to the sense that haunted him of that #morning# ghastly figure following at his heels
he could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along
he could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry
at #length# he went back again and took the road which leads from hatfield to st albans if he stopped it did the same
if he ran it followed not running too that would have been a relief but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of #life# and borne on #one# slow melancholy wind that never $miss_rose$ or fell
at #time# he turned with desperate determination resolved to beat this phantom off though it should #look# him dead but the hair $miss_rose$ on his #head# and his blood stood still for it had turned with him and was behind him then
he had kept it before him that #morning# but it was behind now always he leaned his back against a bank and felt that it stood above him visibly out against the cold #night# sky
he threw himself upon the road on his back upon the road at his #head# it stood silent erect and still a living grave stone with its epitaph in blood
let no #man# talk of murderers escaping justice and hint that providence must sleep there were twenty score of violent #death# in #one# long #minute# of that agony of fear
before the #door# were three tall poplar trees which made it very dark within and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail
he could not walk on till daylight came again and here he stretched himself close to the wall to undergo new torture
there was a shed in a field he passed that offered shelter for the #night# for now a vision came before him as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped
those widely staring #eye# so lustreless and so glassy that he had better borne to see them than think upon them appeared in the midst of the darkness
if he shut out the sight there came the #room# with every well known object some indeed that he would have forgotten if he had gone over its contents from memory each in its accustomed #place#
#light# in themselves but giving #light# to #nothing# there were but two but they were everywhere the body was in its #place# and its #eye# were as he saw them when he stole away
he got up and rushed into the field without the figure was behind him he re entered the shed and shrunk down once more
and here he remained in such terror as none but he can know trembling in every limb and the cold sweat starting from every pore when suddenly there arose upon the #night# wind the noise of distant shouting and the roar of #voice# mingled in alarm and wonder
any sound of #man# in that lonely #place# even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm was #something# to him
he regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger and springing to his #foot# rushed into the open #air#
rising into the #air# with showers of sparks and rolling #one# above the other were sheets of flame lighting the atmosphere for miles round and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood
the #eye# were there before he had laid himself along the broad sky seemed on #fire# the shouts grew louder as new #voice# swelled the roar and he could hear the cry of #fire#
mingled with the ringing of an alarm bell the fall of heavy bodies and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle and shot aloft as though refreshed by food
he darted onward straight headlong dashing through brier and brake and leaping gate and fence as madly as his #dog# who careered with loud and sounding bark before him
the noise increased as he looked there were #people# there #man# and #woman# #light# bustle it was like new #life# to him he came upon the spot
there were half dressed figures tearing to and fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables others driving the cattle from the yard and out #house# and others coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks and the tumbling down of red hot beams
the apertures where #door# and #window# stood an #hour# ago disclosed a mass of raging #fire# walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well the molten lead and iron poured down white hot upon the #ground#
the clanking of the engine pumps and the spirting and hissing of the #water# as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar
#woman# and #child# shrieked and #man# encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers he shouted too till he was hoarse and flying from memory and himself plunged into the thickest of the throng
hither and thither he dived that #night# now working at the pumps and now hurrying through the smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and #man# were thickest
up and down the ladders upon the roofs of buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under the lee of falling bricks and stones in every #part# of that great #fire# was he but he bore a charmed #life# and had neither scratch nor bruise nor weariness nor #thought# till #morning# dawned again and only smoke and blackened ruins remained
he looked suspiciously about him for the #man# were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject of their talk
this mad excitement over there returned with ten fold force the dreadful consciousness of his crime the #dog# obeyed the significant beck of his finger and they drew off stealthily together
he took some bread and meat and as he drank a draught of beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the murder
he has gone to birmingham they say said #one# but they ll have him yet for the scouts are out and by to morrow #night# there ll be a cry all through the country
he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the #ground# then lay down in a lane and had a long but broken and uneasy sleep
he passed near an engine where some #man# were seated and they called to him to share in their refreshment he wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the fear of another solitary #night#
suddenly he took the desperate resolution to going back to london there somebody to speak to there at all event he #thought#
a good hiding #place# too they ll never expect to nab me there after this country scent why cant i lie by for a week or so and forcing blunt from $mr_fagin$ get abroad to france
he acted upon this impulse without delay and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis and entering it at dusk by a circuitous route to proceed straight to that #part# of it which he had fixed on for his destination
if any description of him were out it would not be forgotten that the #dog# was missing and had probably gone with him
he resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went
the animal looked up into his #master# #face# while these preparations were making whether his instinct apprehended #something# of their purpose or the robber sidelong #look# at him was sterner than ordinary he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual and cowered as he came more slowly along
damme i ll risk it the #dog# though this might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the #street# when his #master# halted at the brink of a pool and looked round to call him he stopped outright
the animal came up from the very force of habit but as $mr_william_sikes$ stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and started back come back said the robber
do you hear me call come here cried $mr_william_sikes$ the #dog# wagged his tail but moved not $mr_william_sikes$ made a running noose and called him again
the #dog# advanced retreated paused an instant and scoured away at his hardest speed the #man# whistled again and again and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return
but no #dog# appeared and at #length# he resumed his journey #chapter# xlix monks and $mr_brownlow$ at #length# meet their conversation and the intelligence
the twilight was beginning to close in when $mr_brownlow$ alighted from a hackney coach at his own #door# and knocked softly
the #door# being opened a sturdy #man# got out of the coach and stationed himself on #one# #side# of the steps while another #man# who had been seated on the box dismounted too and stood upon the other #side#
at a sign from $mr_brownlow$ they helped out a third #man# and taking him between them hurried him into the #house#
they walked in the same #manner# up the stairs without speaking and $mr_brownlow$ preceding them led the #way# into a back #room#
that interrupts it this #man# was monks at the #door# of this apartment monks who had ascended with evident reluctance stopped
the two #man# looked at the old #gentleman# as if for instructions he knows the alternative said mr browlow
if he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him drag him into the #street# call for the aid of the police and impeach him as a felon in my #name#
how dare you say this of me asked monks how dare you urge me to it young #man# replied $mr_brownlow$ confronting him with a steady #look#
are you mad enough to leave this #house# unhand him there #sir# you are free to go and we to follow
but i warn you by all i hold most solemn and most sacred that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery
i am resolute and immoveable if you are determined to be the same your blood be upon your own #head#
by what authority am i kidnapped in the #street# and brought here by these #dog# asked monks looking from #one# to the other of the #man# who stood beside him
if you complain of being deprived of your liberty you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet
by mine replied $mr_brownlow$ those #person# are indemnified by me i say again throw yourself for protection on the law
i will appeal to the law too but when you have gone too far to recede do not sue to me for leniency when the power will have passed into other #hand# and do not say i plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed yourself
monks was plainly disconcerted and alarmed besides he hesitated you will decide quickly said $mr_brownlow$ with perfect firmness and composure
if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly and consign you to a punishment the extent of which although i can with a shudder foresee i cannot control once more i say for you know the #way#
if not and you appeal to my forbearance and the mercy of those you have deeply injured seat yourself without a #word# in that #chair#
it has waited for you two whole #day# monks muttered some unintelligible #word# but wavered still you will be prompt said $mr_brownlow$
i have not the inclination to parley said $mr_brownlow$ and as i advocate the dearest interests of others i have not the right
a #word# from me and the alternative has gone for ever still the #man# hesitated is there demanded monks with a faltering tongue is there no middle course
monks looked at the old #gentleman# with an anxious #eye# but reading in his countenance #nothing# but severity and determination walked into the #room# and shrugging his shoulders sat down
none lock the #door# on the outside said $mr_brownlow$ to the attendants and come when i ring the #man# obeyed and the two were left alone together
it is because i was your father oldest #friend# young #man# returned $mr_brownlow$ it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy #year# were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth and left me here a solitary lonely #man# it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters #death# #bed# when he was yet a #boy# on the #morning# that would but heaven willed otherwise have made her my young wife
it is because my seared #heart# clung to him from that #time# forth through all his trials and errors till he died it is because old recollections and associations filled my #heart# and even the sight of you brings with it old #thought# of him it is because of all these #thing# that i am moved to treat you gently now yes edward leeford even now and blush for your unworthiness who bear the #name#
what has the #name# to do with it asked the other after contemplating half in #silence# and half in dogged wonder the agitation of his #companion#
this is pretty treatment #sir# said monks throwing down his #hat# and cloak from my father oldest #friend# what is the #name# to me
but it was hers and even at this distance of #time# brings back to me an old #man# the glow and thrill which i once felt only to hear it repeated by a stranger
this is all mighty fine said monks to retain his assumed designation after a long #silence# during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro and $mr_brownlow$ had sat shading his #face# with his #hand#
#nothing# replied $mr_brownlow$ #nothing# to you i am very glad you have changed it very very but what do you want with me
you have a brother said $mr_brownlow$ rousing himself a brother the whisper of whose #name# in your ear when i came behind you in the #street# was in itself almost enough to make you accompany me hither in wonder and alarm
i have no brother replied monks you know i was an only #child# why do you talk to me of brothers
you know that as well as i attend to what i do know and you may not said $mr_brownlow$
i know that of the wretched marriage into which family pride and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition forced your unhappy father when a mere #boy# you were the sole and most unnatural issue
i shall interest you by and by i dont care for hard #name# interrupted monks with a jeering laugh you know the fact and that enough for me
i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both
i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave #place# to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder and retiring a wide space apart carried each a galling fragment of which #nothing# but #death# could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest #look# they could assume
but i also know pursued the old #gentleman# the misery the slow torture the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union your #mother# succeeded she forgot it soon
but it rusted and cankered at your father #heart# for #year# well they were separated said monks and what of that
when they had been separated for some #time# returned $mr_brownlow$ and your #mother# wholly given up to continental frivolities had utterly forgotten the young husband
ten good #year# her junior who with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new #friend# this circumstance at least you know already
not i said monks turning away his #eye# and beating his #foot# upon the #ground# as a #man# who is determined to deny everything
your #manner# no less than your actions assures me that you have never forgotten it or ceased to think of it with bitterness returned $mr_brownlow$
i speak of fifteen #year# ago when you were not more than eleven #year# old and your father but #one# and thirty for he was i repeat a #boy# when his father ordered him to marry
must i go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent or will you spare it and disclose to me the truth
these new #friend# then said $mr_brownlow$ were a naval officer retired from active service whose wife had died some half a #year# before and left him with two #child# there had been more but of all their family happily but two survived
they were both daughters #one# a beautiful creature of nineteen and the other a mere #child# of two or three #year# old
not i i have #nothing# to disclose rejoined monks you must talk on if you will what this to me asked monks
they resided said $mr_brownlow$ without seeming to hear the interruption in a #part# of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired and where he had taken up his abode
acquaintance intimacy friendship fast followed on each other your father was gifted as few #man# are he had his sister soul and #person#
as the old officer knew him more and more he grew to love him i would that it had ended there
the old #gentleman# paused monks was biting his lips with his #eye# fixed upon the floor seeing this he immediately resumed the end of a #year# found him contracted solemnly contracted to that daughter the object of the first true ardent only passion of a guileless #girl#
it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow young #man# returned $mr_brownlow$ and such tales usually are
his daughter did the same your tale is of the longest observed monks moving restlessly in his #chair# if it were #one# of unmixed joy and happiness it would be very brief
at #length# #one# of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed as others are often it is no uncommon case died and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him his panacea for all griefs money
it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome whither this #man# had sped for health and where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion
he went was seized with mortal illness there was followed the #moment# the intelligence reached paris by your #mother# who carried you with her he died the #day# after her arrival leaving no will no will so that the whole property fell to her and you
at this #part# of the recital monks held his breath and listened with a #face# of intense eagerness though his #eye# were not directed towards the speaker
as $mr_brownlow$ paused he changed his position with the #air# of #one# who has experienced a sudden relief and wiped his hot #face# and #hand#
before he went abroad and as he passed through london on his #way# said $mr_brownlow$ slowly and fixing his #eye# upon the other #face# he came to me
i never heard of that interrupted monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous but savouring more of disagreeable surprise
he came to me and left with me among some other #thing# a picture a portrait painted by himself a likeness of this poor #girl# which he did not wish to leave behind and could not carry forward on his hasty journey
he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow talked in a wild distracted #way# of ruin and dishonour worked by himself confided to me his intention to convert his whole property at any loss into money and having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition to fly the country i guessed too well he would not fly alone and never see it more
even from me his old and early #friend# whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered #one# most #dear# to both even from me he withheld any more particular confession promising to write and tell me all and after that to see me once again for the last #time# on earth
i went said $mr_brownlow$ after a short pause i went when all was over to the scene of his i will use the term the world would freely use for
worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him of his guilty love resolved that if my fears were realised that erring #child# should find #one# #heart# and home to shelter and compassionate her
the family had left that #part# a week before they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding discharged them and left the #place# by #night#
alas that was the last #time# i had no letter and i never saw him more why or whither none can tell
when your brother said $mr_brownlow$ drawing nearer to the other #chair# when your brother a feeble ragged neglected #child# was cast in my #way# by a stronger #hand# than chance and rescued by me from a #life# of vice and infamy what cried monks
monks drew his breath yet more freely and looked round with a smile of triumph by me said $mr_brownlow$
i told you i should interest you before long i say by me i see that your cunning associate suppressed my #name#
when he was rescued by me then and lay recovering from sickness in my #house# his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of struck me with astonishment
even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery there was a lingering expression in his #face# that came upon me like a glimpse of some old #friend# flashing on #one# in a vivid dream
although for ought he knew it would be quite strange to your ears i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history
why not asked monks hastily because you know it well i denial to me is vain replied $mr_brownlow$
i shall show you that i know more than that you you cant prove #anything# against me stammered monks i defy you to do it
we shall see returned the old #gentleman# with a searching glance i lost the #boy# and no efforts of mine could recover him
your #mother# being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indies whither as you well know you retired upon your #mother# #death# to escape the consequences of vicious courses here i made the voyage
you had left it months before and were supposed to be in london but no #one# could tell where i returned
you came and went they said as strangely as you had ever done sometimes for #day# together and sometimes not for months keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable #boy#
i paced the #street# by #night# and #day# but until two #hour# ago all my efforts were fruitless and i never saw you for an instant
your agents had no clue to your residence i wearied them with new applications and now you do see me said monks rising boldly what then
fraud and robbery are high sounding #word# justified you think by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead #man# brother
you dont even know that a #child# was born of this maudlin pair you dont even know that i did not replied $mr_brownlow$ rising too but within the last fortnight i have learnt it all
you have a brother you know it and him there was a will which your #mother# destroyed leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own #death#
it contained a reference to some #child# likely to be the result of this sad connection which #child# was born and accidentally encountered by you when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father
those proofs were destroyed by you and now in your own #word# to your accomplice the jew the only proofs of the #boy# identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the #mother# is rotting in her coffin
unworthy son coward liar you who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark #room# at #night# you whose plots and wiles have brought a violent #death# upon the #head# of #one# worth millions such as you you who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father #heart# and in whom all evil passions vice and profligacy festered till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your #face# an index even to your #mind#
you repaired to the #place# of his birth there existed proofs proofs long suppressed of his birth and parentage you edward leeford do you still brave me
no no no returned the coward overwhelmed by these accumulated charges every #word# cried the #gentleman# every #word# that has passed between you and this detested villain is known to me
shadows on the wall have caught your whispers and brought them to my ear the sight of the persecuted #child# has turned vice itself and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue
murder has been done to which you were morally if not really a party no no interposed monks i i knew #nothing# of that i was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me
i didnt know the cause i #thought# it was a common quarrel it was the partial disclosure of your secrets replied $mr_brownlow$
set your #hand# to a statement of truth and facts and repeat it before witnesses that i promise too remain quietly here until such a document is drawn up and proceed with me to such a #place# as i may deem most advisable for the purpose of attesting it if you insist upon that i ll do that also replied monks
make restitution to an innocent and unoffending #child# for such he is although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love
will you disclose the whole yes i will you must do more than that said $mr_brownlow$ you have not forgotten the provisions of the will
carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned and then go where you please in this world you need meet no more
while monks was pacing up and down meditating with dark and evil #look# on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it torn by his fears on the #one# #hand# and his hatred on the other the #door# was hurriedly unlocked and a #gentleman# $mr_losberne$ entered the #room# in violent agitation
the #man# will be taken he cried he will be taken to #night# the murderer asked $mr_brownlow$ yes yes replied the other
his #dog# has been seen lurking about some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his #master# either is or will be there under cover of the darkness
spies are hovering about in every direction i have spoken to the #man# who are charged with his capture and they tell me he cannot escape
a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government to #night# i will give fifty more said $mr_brownlow$ and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot if i can reach it
as soon as he had seen your #friend# here safe in a coach with you he hurried off to where he heard this replied the #doctor# and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some #place# in the outskirts agreed upon between them
where is mr maylie $harry_maylie$ $mr_fagin$ said $mr_brownlow$ what of him when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by this #time#
they re sure of him have you made up your #mind# asked $mr_brownlow$ in a low #voice# of monks yes he replied
you you will be secret with me i will remain here till i return it is your only hope of safety they left the #room# and the #door# was again locked
what have you done asked the #doctor# in a whisper all that i could hope to do and even more
coupling the poor #girl# intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good #friend# inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and laid bare the whole villainy which by these #light# became plain as #day#
we shall be down there a few #hour# before but shall require rest especially the young #lady# who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now
write and appoint the evening after to morrow at seven for the meeting but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature
which #way# have they taken drive straight to the office and you will be in #time# replied $mr_losberne$
#chapter# the pursuit and escape near to that #part# of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close built low roofed #house#
there exists the filthiest the strangest the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in london wholly unknown even by #name# to the great mass of its inhabitants
to reach this #place# the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close narrow and muddy #street# thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside #people# and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion
the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman #door# and stream from the #house# parapet and #window#
jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class ballast heavers coal whippers brazen #woman# ragged #child# and the raff and refuse of the river he makes his #way# with difficulty along assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every #corner#
arriving at #length# in #street# remoter and less frequented than those through which he has passed he walks beneath tottering #house# fronts projecting over the pavement dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes
chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall #window# guarded by rusty iron bars that #time# and dirt have almost eaten away every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect
in such a neighborhood beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark stands jacob island surrounded by a muddy ditch six or eight #foot# deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in once called mill pond but known in the #day# of this story as folly ditch
it is a creek or inlet from the thames and can always be filled at high #water# by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old #name#
at such #time# a stranger looking from #one# of the wooden bridges thrown across it at mill lane will see the inhabitants of the #house# on either #side# lowering from their back #door# and #window# buckets pails domestic utensils of all kinds in which to haul the #water# up and when his #eye# is turned from these operations to the #house# themselves his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him
crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen #house# with holes from which to #look# upon the slime beneath #window# broken and patched with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen that is never there #room# so small so filthy so confined that the #air# would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening to fall into it as some have done dirt besmeared walls and decaying foundations every repulsive lineament of poverty every loathsome indication of filth rot and garbage all these ornament the banks of folly ditch
in jacob island the warehouses are roofless and empty the walls are crumbling down the #window# are #window# no more the #door# are falling into the #street# the chimneys are blackened but they yield no smoke
thirty or forty #year# ago before losses and chancery suits came upon it it was a thriving #place# but now it is a desolate island indeed
the #house# have no owners they are broken open and entered upon by those who have the courage and there they live and there they die
they must have powerful motives for a secret residence or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed who seek a refuge in jacob island
in an upper #room# of #one# of these #house# a detached #house# of fair size ruinous in other respects but strongly defended at #door# and #window# of which #house# the back commanded the ditch in #manner# already described there were assembled three #man# who regarding each other every now and then with #look# expressive of perplexity and expectation sat for some #time# in profound and gloomy #silence#
#one# of these was $mr_toby_crackit$ another $mr_chitling$ and the third a robber of fifty #year# whose nose had been almost beaten in in some old scuffle and whose #face# bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion
i will remain here the two #gentleman# hastily separated each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable this #man# was a returned transport and his #name# was kags
i wish said $mr_toby_crackit$ turning to $mr_chitling$ that you had picked out some other crib when the two old #one# got too warm and had not come here my fine feller
well i #thought# you have been a little more glad to see me than this replied $mr_chitling$ with a melancholy #air#
why #look# young #gentleman# said $mr_toby_crackit$ when a #man# keeps himself so very ex clusive as i have done and by that means has a snug #house# over his #head# with nobody a prying and smelling about it it rather a startling #thing# to have the honour of a wisit from a young #gentleman# however respectable and pleasant a #person# he may be to play cards with at conweniency circumstanced as you are
especially when the exclusive young #man# has got a #friend# stopping with him that arrived sooner than was expected from foreign #part# and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return added mr kags
there was a short #silence# after which $mr_toby_crackit$ seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil may care swagger turned to $mr_chitling$ and said when was $mr_fagin$ took then
$charley_bates$ and i made our lucky up the wash us chimney and bolter got into the empty #water# butt #head# downwards but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top and so they took him too
she went to see the body to speak to who it was replied $mr_chitling$ his countenance falling more and more and went off mad screaming and raving and beating her #head# against the boards so they put a strait weskut on her and took her to the hospital and there she is
why didnt you blunder #head# said kags just at dinner #time# two clock this afternoon and bet poor bet wot come of young $charley_bates$ demanded kags
there nowhere else to go to now for the #people# at the cripples are all in custody and the bar of the ken
he hung about not to come over here afore dark but he ll be here soon replied $mr_chitling$ i went up there and see it with my own #eye# is filled with traps
the sessions are on said kags if they get the inquest over and bolter turns king evidence as of course he will from what he said already they can prove $mr_fagin$ an accessory before the fact and get the trial on on friday and he ll swing in six #day# from this by
this is a smash observed $mr_toby_crackit$ biting his lips there more than #one# will go with this you should have heard the #people# groan said $mr_chitling$ the officers fought like devils or they have torn him away
you should have seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to them as if they were his dearest #friend#
i can see em now not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob and draggin him along amongst em i can see the #people# jumping up #one# behind another and snarling with their teeth and making at him i can see the blood upon his hair and beard and hear the cries with which the #woman# worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the #street# #corner# and swore they #tear# his #heart# out
the horror stricken witness of this scene pressed his #hand# upon his ears and with his #eye# closed got up and paced violently to and fro like #one# distracted
while he was thus engaged and the two #man# sat by in #silence# with their #eye# fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs and $mr_william_sikes$ #dog# bounded into the #room#
he was down once but they made a ring round him and fought their #way# along they ran to the #window# downstairs and into the #street#
the #dog# had jumped in at an open #window# he made no attempt to follow them nor was his #master# to be seen
if he was coming here he have come with the #dog# said kags stooping down to examine the animal who lay panting on the floor
what the meaning of this said $mr_toby_crackit$ when they had returned he cant be coming here i i hope not here give us some #water# for him he has run himself faint
he drunk it all up every drop said $mr_chitling$ after watching the #dog# some #time# in #silence# covered with mud lame half blind he must have come a long #way#
he been to the other kens of course and finding them filled with strangers come on here where he been many a #time# and often
but where can he have come from first and how comes he here alone without the other he none of them called the murderer by his old #name# he cant have made away with himself
where can he have come from exclaimed $mr_toby_crackit$ what do you think said $mr_chitling$ $mr_toby_crackit$ shook his #head# if he had said kags the #dog# ud want to lead us away to where he did it
no i think he got out of the country and left the #dog# behind he must have given him the slip somehow or he wouldnt be so easy
this solution appearing the most probable #one# was adopted as the right the #dog# creeping under a #chair# coiled himself up to sleep without more notice from anybody
the terrible events of the last two #day# had made a deep impression on all three increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position
it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candle lighted and placed upon the #table# they drew their #chair# closer together starting at every sound
they spoke little and that in whispers and were as silent and awe stricken as if the remains of the murdered #woman# lay in the next #room#
they had sat thus some #time# when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the #door# below young $charley_bates$ said kags looking angrily round to check the fear he felt himself
the knocking came again no it wasnt he he never knocked like that $mr_toby_crackit$ went to the #window# and shaking all over drew in his #head#
there was no need to tell them who it was his pale #face# was enough the #dog# too was on the alert in an instant and ran whining to the #door#
we must let him in he said taking up the candle isnt there any help for it asked the other #man# in a hoarse #voice#
dont leave us in the dark said kags taking down a candle from the chimney piece and lighting it with such a trembling #hand# that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished
$mr_toby_crackit$ went down to the #door# and returned followed by a #man# with the lower #part# of his #face# buried in a handkerchief and another tied over his #head# under his #hat#
blanched #face# sunken #eye# hollow cheeks beard of three #day# growth wasted flesh short thick breath it was the very ghost of $mr_william_sikes$
he laid his #hand# upon a #chair# which stood in the middle of the #room# but shuddering as he was about to drop into it and seeming to glance over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wall as close as it would go and #ground# it against it and sat down
none he must come in he drew them slowly off not a #word# had been exchanged he looked from #one# to another in #silence#
if an #eye# were furtively raised and met his it was instantly averted when his hollow #voice# broke #silence# they all three started
they seemed never to have heard its tones before how came that #dog# here he asked alone three #hour# ago to #night# paper says that $mr_fagin$ took
is it true or a lie true they were silent again damn you all said $mr_william_sikes$ passing his #hand# across his forehead
you that keep this #house# said $mr_william_sikes$ turning his #face# to $mr_toby_crackit$ do you mean to sell me or to let me lie here till this hunt is over
have you #nothing# to say to me there was an uneasy movement among them but nobody spoke you may stop here if you think it safe returned the #person# addressed after some hesitation
$mr_william_sikes$ carried his #eye# slowly up the wall behind him rather trying to turn his #head# than actually doing it and said is it the body is it buried
they shook their #head# why isnt it he retorted with the same glance behind him wot do they keep such ugly #thing# above the #ground# for who that knocking
$mr_toby_crackit$ intimated by a motion of his #hand# as he left the #room# that there was #nothing# to fear and directly came back with $charley_bates$ behind him
$mr_william_sikes$ sat opposite the #door# so that the #moment# the #boy# entered the #room# he encountered his figure $mr_toby_crackit$ said the #boy# falling back as $mr_william_sikes$ turned his #eye# towards him why didnt you tell me this downstairs
there had been #something# so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three that the wretched #man# was willing to propitiate even this lad
accordingly he nodded and made as though he would shake #hand# with him let me go into some other #room# said the #boy# retreating still farther
dont come nearer me answered the #boy# still retreating and looking with horror in his #eye# upon the murderer #face#
$charley_bates$ said $mr_william_sikes$ stepping forward dont you dont you know me you monster the #man# stopped half #way# and they looked at each other but $mr_william_sikes$ #eye# sunk gradually to the #ground#
witness you three cried the #boy# shaking his clenched fist and becoming more and more excited as he spoke witness you three
i not afraid of him if they come here after him i ll give him up i will i tell you out at once
he may kill me for it if he likes or if he dares but if i am here i ll give him up
i give him up if he was to be boiled alive murder help if there the pluck of a #man# among you three you ll help me
pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent gesticulation the #boy# actually threw himself single handed upon the strong #man# and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise brought him heavily to the #ground#
they offered no interference and the #boy# and #man# rolled on the #ground# together the former heedless of the blows that showered upon him wrenching his #hand# tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer breast and never ceasing to call for help with all his might
$mr_william_sikes$ had him down and his knee was on his throat when $mr_toby_crackit$ pulled him back with a #look# of alarm and pointed to the #window#
there were #light# gleaming below #voice# in loud and earnest conversation the tramp of hurried footsteps endless they seemed in number crossing the nearest wooden bridge
#one# #man# on horseback seemed to be among the crowd for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement
murder help down with him the three spectators seemed quite stupefied the contest however was too unequal to last long the gleam of #light# increased the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on
then came a loud knocking at the #door# and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry #voice# as would have made the boldest quail
help shrieked the #boy# in a #voice# that rent the #air# he here break down the #door# in the king #name# cried the #voice# without and the hoarse cry arose again but louder
break down the #door# screamed the #boy# i tell you they ll never open it run straight to the #room# where the #light# is
strokes thick and heavy rattled upon the #door# and lower #window# shutters as he ceased to speak and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd giving the listener for the first #time# some adequate idea of its immense extent
open the #door# of some #place# where i can lock this screeching hell babe cried $mr_william_sikes$ fiercely running to and fro and dragging the #boy# now as easily as if he were an empty sack
is the downstairs #door# fast double locked and chained replied $mr_toby_crackit$ who with the other two #man# still remained quite helpless and bewildered
break down the #door# that #door# quick he flung him in bolted it and turned the key the panels are they strong
lined with sheet iron and the #window# too yes and the #window# damn you cried the desperate ruffian throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd
do your worst i ll cheat you yet of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng
some shouted to those who were nearest to set the #house# on #fire# others roared to the officers to shoot him dead
among them all none showed such fury as the #man# on horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting #water# cried beneath the #window# in a #voice# that $miss_rose$ above all others twenty guineas to the #man# who brings a ladder
some called for ladders some for sledge hammers some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them and still came back and roared again some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of those below some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the #water# spout and crevices in the wall and all waved to and fro in the darkness beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind and joined from #time# to #time# in #one# loud furious roar
the tide cried the murderer as he staggered back into the #room# and shut the #face# out the tide was in as i came up
the nearest #voice# took up the cry and hundreds echoed it give me a rope a long rope they re all in front
i may drop into the folly ditch and clear off that #way# give me a rope or i shall do three more murders and kill myself
the panic stricken #man# pointed to where such articles were kept the murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up to the #house# top
all the #window# in the rear of the #house# had been long ago bricked up except #one# small trap in the #room# where the #boy# was locked and that was too small even for the passage of his body
but from this aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the back and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the #house# top by the #door# in the roof a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front who immediately began to pour round pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream
he planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose so firmly against the #door# that it must be #matter# of great difficulty to open it from the inside and creeping over the tiles looked over the low parapet
the crowd had been hushed during these few #moment# watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers
those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning took up the sound it echoed and re echoed it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him
on pressed the #people# from the front on on on in a strong struggling current of angry #face# with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up and show them out in all their wrath and passion
the #house# on the opposite #side# of the ditch had been entered by the mob sashes were thrown up or torn bodily out there were tiers and tiers of #face# in every #window# cluster upon cluster of #people# clinging to every #house# top
the #water# was out and the ditch a #bed# of mud again and again it $miss_rose$ each little bridge and there were three in sight bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it
still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts and only for an instant see the wretch
they have him now cried a #man# on the nearest bridge hurrah the crowd grew #light# with uncovered #head# and again the shout uprose
i will give fifty pounds cried an old #gentleman# from the same quarter to the #man# who takes him alive i will remain here till he come to ask me for it
at this #moment# the #word# was passed among the crowd that the #door# was forced at last and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the #room#
the stream abruptly turned as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth and the #people# at the #window# seeing those upon the bridges pouring back quitted their stations and running into the #street# joined the concourse that now thronged pell mell to the spot they had left each #man# crushing and striving with his neighbor and all panting with impatience to get near the #door# and #look# upon the criminal as the officers brought him out
the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation or trampled down and trodden under #foot# in the confusion were dreadful the narrow #way# were completely blocked up and at this #time# between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the #house# and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer although the universal eagerness for his capture was if possible increased
the #man# had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd and the impossibility of escape but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred he sprang upon his #foot# determined to make #one# last effort for his #life# by dropping into the ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion
roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within the #house# which announced that an entrance had really been effected he set his #foot# against the stack of chimneys fastened #one# end of the rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his #hand# and teeth almost in a second
he could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the #ground# than his own height and had his knife ready in his #hand# to cut it then and drop
at the very instant when he brought the loop over his #head# previous to slipping it beneath his #arm# pits and when the old #gentleman# before mentioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly warned those about him that the #man# was about to lower himself down at that very instant the murderer looking behind him on the roof threw his #arm# above his #head# and uttered a yell of terror
there was another roar the #eye# again he cried in an unearthly screech staggering as if struck by lightning he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet
the noose was on his neck it ran up with his weight tight as a bow string and swift as the arrow it speeds
there was a sudden jerk a terrific convulsion of the limbs and there he hung with the open knife clenched in his stiffening #hand#
the murderer swung lifeless against the wall and the #boy# thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view called to the #people# to come and take him out for god sake
a #dog# which had lain concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl and collecting himself for a spring jumped for the dead #man# shoulders
missing his aim he fell into the ditch turning completely over as he went and striking his #head# against a stone dashed out his brains
#chapter# li affording an explanation of more mysteries than #one# and comprehending a proposal of marriage with no #word# of settlement or pin money
the events narrated in the last #chapter# were yet but two #day# old when $oliver_twist$ found himself at three clock in the afternoon in a travelling carriage rolling fast towards his native town
$mrs_maylie$ and $miss_rose$ and $mrs_bedwin$ and the good #doctor# were with him and $mr_brownlow$ followed in a post chaise accompanied by #one# other #person# whose #name# had not been mentioned
they had not talked much upon the #way# for $oliver_twist$ was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his #thought# and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his #companion# who shared it in at least an equal degree
he and the two #lady# had been very carefully made acquainted by $mr_brownlow$ with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from monks and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole #matter# was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense
the same kind #friend# had with $mr_losberne$ assistance cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken #place#
it was quite true he said that they must know them before long but it might be at a better #time# than the present and it could not be at a worse
he fell for five and thirty #foot# the old chimney quivered with the shock but stood it bravely so they travelled on in #silence#
each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together and no #one# disposed to give utterance to the #thought# which crowded upon all
but if $oliver_twist$ under these influences had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth #place# by a road he had never seen how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old #time# and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into that which he had traversed on #foot# a poor houseless wandering #boy# without a #friend# to help him or a roof to shelter his #head#
cried $oliver_twist$ eagerly clasping the #hand# of $miss_rose$ and pointing out at the carriage #window# that the stile i came over there are the hedges i crept behind for fear any #one# should overtake me and force me back
see there there yonder is the path across the fields leading to the old #house# where i was a little #child#
oh $dick$ dick my #dear# old #friend# if i could only see you now you will see him soon replied $miss_rose$ gently taking his folded #hand# between her own
you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too
we ll take him away from here and have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country #place# where he may grow strong and well shall we
yes yes said $oliver_twist$ and we ll $miss_rose$ nodded yes for the #boy# was smiling through such happy #tear# that she could not speak
it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell but never #mind# never #mind# it will be all over and you will smile again
you will be kind and good to him for you are to every #one# said $oliver_twist$ i know that too to think how changed he is you did the same with me
he said god bless you to me when i ran away cried the #boy# with a burst of affectionate emotion and i will say god bless you now and show him how i love him for it
as they approached the town and at #length# drove through its narrow #street# it became #matter# of no small difficulty to restrain the #boy# within reasonable bounds
there was $mr_sowerberry$ the undertaker just as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it there were all the well known shops and #house# with almost every #one# of which he had some slight incident connected there was $mr_gamfield$ cart the very cart he used to have standing at the old public #house# #door# there was the workhouse the dreary prison of his youthful #day# with its dismal #window# frowning on the #street# there was the same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom $oliver_twist$ involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so foolish then cried then laughed again there were scores of #face# at the #door# and #window#
there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent #life# had been but a happy dream
they drove straight to the #door# of the chief hotel which $oliver_twist$ used to stare up at with awe and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size and here was $mr_grimwig$ all ready to receive them kissing the young #lady# and the old #one# too when they got out of the coach as if he were the grandfather of the whole party all smiles and kindness and not offering to eat his #head# no not once not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london and maintained he knew it best though he had only come that #way# once and that #time# fast asleep
that he knew quite well but it was pure earnest joyful reality there was dinner prepared and there were bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic
notwithstanding all this when the hurry of the first half #hour# was over the same #silence# and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down
the two other #gentleman# hurried in and out with anxious #face# and during the short intervals when they were present conversed apart
$mr_brownlow$ did not join them at dinner but remained in a separate #room# once $mrs_maylie$ was called away and after being absent for nearly an #hour# returned with #eye# swollen with weeping
they sat wondering in #silence# or if they exchanged a few #word# spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own #voice#
at #length# when nine clock had come and they began to think they were to hear no more that #night# $mr_losberne$ and $mr_grimwig$ entered the #room# followed by $mr_brownlow$ and a #man# whom $oliver_twist$ almost shrieked with surprise to see for they told him it was his brother and it was the same #man# he had met at the market town and seen looking in with $mr_fagin$ at the #window# of his little #room#
monks cast a #look# of hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished #boy# and sat down near the #door#
all these #thing# made $miss_rose$ and $oliver_twist$ who were not in any new secrets nervous and uncomfortable $mr_brownlow$ who had papers in his #hand# walked to a #table# near which $miss_rose$ and $oliver_twist$ were seated
this is a painful task said he but these declarations which have been signed in london before many #gentleman# must be in substance repeated here
i would have spared you the degradation but we must hear them from your own lips before we #part# and you know why go on
said the #person# addressed turning away his #face# quick i have almost done enough i think dont keep me here
this #child# said $mr_brownlow$ drawing $oliver_twist$ to him and laying his #hand# upon his #head# is your half brother the illegitimate son of your father my #dear# #friend# edwin leeford by poor young agnes fleming who died in giving him birth
yes said monks scowling at the trembling #boy# the beating of whose #heart# he might have heard that is the bastard #child#
the term you use said $mr_brownlow$ sternly is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world
it reflects disgrace on no #one# living except you who use it let that pass he was born in this town
in the workhouse of this town was the sullen reply you have the story there he pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke
i must have it here too said $mr_brownlow$ looking round upon the listeners listen then you returned monks
his father being taken ill at rome was joined by his wife my #mother# from whom he had been long separated who went from paris and took me with her to #look# after his property for what i know for she had no great affection for him nor he for her
among the papers in his desk were two dated on the #night# his illness first came on directed to yourself he addressed himself to $mr_brownlow$ and enclosed in a few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead
he knew #nothing# of us for his senses were gone and he slumbered on till next #day# when he died #one# of these papers was a letter to this #girl# agnes the other a will
what of the letter asked $mr_brownlow$ the letter a sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a penitent confession and prayers to god to help her
he had palmed a tale on the #girl# that some secret mystery to be explained #one# #day# prevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what none could ever give her back
he told her all he had meant to do to hide her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young #child# for all the guilt was his
he reminded her of the #day# he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian #name# engraved upon it and a blank left for that
which he hoped #one# #day# to have bestowed upon her prayed her yet to keep it and wear it next her #heart# as she had done before and then ran on wildly in the same #word# over and over again as if he had gone distracted
she was at that #time# within a few months of her confinement i believe he had the will said $mr_brownlow$ as $oliver_twist$ #tear# fell fast
he talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him and left you and your #mother# each an annuity of eight hundred pounds
the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions #one# for agnes fleming and the other for their #child# if it should be born alive and ever come of age
if it were a #girl# it was to inherit the money unconditionally but if a #boy# only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his #name# with any public act of dishonour meanness cowardice or wrong
he did this he said to mark his confidence in the other and his conviction only strengthened by approaching #death# that the #child# would share her gentle #heart# and noble nature
monks was silent the will said $mr_brownlow$ speaking for him was in the same spirit as the letter if he were disappointed in this expectation then the money was to come to you
for then and not till then when both #child# were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse who had none upon his #heart# but had from an infant repulsed him with coldness and aversion
my #mother# said monks in a louder tone did what a #woman# should have done she burnt this will the letter never reached its destination but
the #girl# father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate i love her for it now could add
goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his #child# into a remote #corner# of wales changing his very #name# that his #friend# might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards he was found dead in his #bed#
the #girl# had left her home in secret some weeks before he had searched for her on #foot# in every town and village near it was on the #night# when he returned home assured that she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old #heart# broke
that and other proofs she kept in case they ever tried to lie away the blot there was a short #silence# here until $mr_brownlow$ took up the thread of the narrative
he had left her when only eighteen robbed her of jewels and money gambled squandered forged and fled to london where for two #year# he had associated with the lowest outcasts
#year# after this he said this #man# edward leeford #mother# came to me she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease and wished to recover him before she died
inquiries were set on #foot# and strict searches made they were unavailing for a long #time# but ultimately successful and he went back with her to france
there she died said monks after a lingering illness and on her #death# #bed# she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before
she would not believe that the #girl# had destroyed herself and the #child# too but was filled with the impression that a male #child# had been born and was alive
i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it if i could to the very gallows #foot#
she was right he came in my #way# at last i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began
as the villain folded his #arm# tight together and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice $mr_brownlow$ turned to the terrified group beside him and explained that the jew who had been his old accomplice and confidant had a large reward for keeping $oliver_twist$ ensnared of which some #part# was to be given up in the event of his being rescued and that a dispute on this #head# had led to their visit to the country #house# for the purpose of identifying him
i bought them from the #man# and #woman# i told you of who stole them from the nurse who stole them from the corpse answered monks without raising his #eye#
$mr_brownlow$ merely nodded to $mr_grimwig$ who disappearing with great alacrity shortly returned pushing in mrs $mr_bumble$ and dragging her unwilling consort after him
the locket and ring said $mr_brownlow$ turning to monks you know what became of them do my hi deceive me cried $mr_bumble$ with ill feigned enthusiasm or is that little $oliver_twist$
oh li ver if you know how i ve been a grieving for you hold your tongue fool murmured mrs $mr_bumble$ isnt natur natur mrs $mr_bumble$ remonstrated the workhouse #master#
cant i be supposed to feel i as brought him up porochially when i see him a setting here among #lady# and #gentleman# of the very affablest description
i always loved that #boy# as if he been my my my own grandfather said $mr_bumble$ halting for an appropriate comparison
#master# $oliver_twist$ my #dear# you remember the blessed #gentleman# in the white waistcoat ah he went to heaven last week in a oak coffin with plated handles $oliver_twist$
come #sir# said $mr_grimwig$ tartly suppress your feelings i will do my endeavours #sir# replied $mr_bumble$ how do you do #sir#
i hope you are very well this salutation was addressed to $mr_brownlow$ who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple
he inquired as he pointed to monks do you know that #person# no replied mrs $mr_bumble$ flatly perhaps you dont said $mr_brownlow$ addressing her spouse
i never saw him in all my #life# said $mr_bumble$ nor sold him #anything# perhaps no replied mrs $mr_bumble$
you never had perhaps a certain gold locket and ring said $mr_brownlow$ certainly not replied the #matron# why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this
but not again did he return with a stout #man# and wife for this #time# he led in two palsied #woman# who shook and tottered as they walked
you shut the #door# the #night# old sally died said the foremost #one# raising her shrivelled #hand# but you couldnt shut out the sound nor stop the chinks
again $mr_brownlow$ nodded to $mr_grimwig$ and again that #gentleman# limped away with extraordinary readiness no no said the other looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws
no no no we heard her try to tell you what she done and saw you take a paper from her #hand# and watched you too next #day# to the pawnbroker shop said the first
yes added the second and it was a locket and gold ring we found out that and saw it given you
and we know more than that resumed the first for she told us often long ago that the young #mother# had told her that feeling she should never get over it she was on her #way# at the #time# that she was taken ill to die near the grave of the father of the #child#
we were by oh we were by would you like to see the pawnbroker himself asked $mr_grimwig$ with a motion towards the #door#
no replied the #woman# if he she pointed to monks has been coward enough to confess as i see he has and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right #one# i have #nothing# more to say
#nothing# replied $mr_brownlow$ except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again
i hope said $mr_bumble$ looking about him with great ruefulness as $mr_grimwig$ disappeared with the two old #woman# i hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office
i did sell them and they re where you ll never get them what then you may leave the #room# indeed it will replied $mr_brownlow$
you may make up your #mind# to that and think yourself well off besides it was all mrs $mr_bumble$ she would do it urged $mr_bumble$ first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the #room#
you were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets and indeed are the more guilty of the two in the #eye# of the law for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction
if the law supposes that said $mr_bumble$ squeezing his #hat# emphatically in both #hand# the law is a ass a idiot
if that the #eye# of the law the law is a bachelor and the worst i wish the law is that his #eye# may be opened by experience by experience
laying great stress on the repetition of these two #word# $mr_bumble$ fixed his #hat# on very tight and putting his #hand# in his #pocket# followed his helpmate downstairs
that is no excuse replied $mr_brownlow$ young #lady# said $mr_brownlow$ turning to $miss_rose$ give me your #hand#
if they have i do not know how they can but if they have any reference to me said $miss_rose$ pray let me hear them at some other #time#
do not tremble you need not fear to hear the few remaining #word# we have to say i have not strength or spirits now
nay returned the old gentlman drawing her #arm# through his you have more fortitude than this i am sure do you know this young #lady# #sir#
yes replied monks i never saw you before said $miss_rose$ faintly i have seen you often returned monks
the father of the unhappy agnes had two daughters said $mr_brownlow$ what was the fate of the other the #child#
the #child# replied monks when her father died in a strange #place# in a strange #name# without a letter #book# or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his #friend# or relatives could be traced the #child# was taken by some wretched cottagers who reared it as their own go on said $mr_brownlow$ signing to $mrs_maylie$ to approach
you couldnt find the spot to which these #people# had repaired said monks but where friendship fails hatred will often force a #way#
go on my #mother# found it after a #year# of cunning search ay and found the #child# she took it did she
the #people# were poor and began to sicken at least the #man# did of their fine humanity so she left it with them giving them a small present of money which would not last long and promised more which she never meant to send
she didnt quite rely however on their discontent and poverty for the #child# unhappiness but told the history of the sister shame with such alterations as suited her bade them take good heed of the #child# for she came of bad blood and told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong at #one# #time# or other
the circumstances countenanced all this the #people# believed it and there the #child# dragged on an existence miserable enough even to satisfy us until a widow #lady# residing then at chester saw the #girl# by chance pitied her and took her home
there was some cursed spell i think against us for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy
no i lost sight of her two or three #year# ago and saw her no more until a few months back
do you see her now yes leaning on your #arm# but not the less my niece cried $mrs_maylie$ folding the fainting #girl# in her #arm#
not the less my dearest #child# i would not lose her now for all the treasures of the world my sweet #companion# my own #dear# #girl# the only #friend# i ever had cried $miss_rose$ clinging to her
i cannot bear all this you have borne more and have been through all the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every #one# she knew said $mrs_maylie$ embracing her tenderly
the kindest best of #friend# my #heart# will burst come come my love remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his #arm# poor #child#
see here #look# look my #dear# not aunt cried $oliver_twist$ throwing his #arm# about her neck i ll never call her aunt sister my own #dear# sister that #something# taught my #heart# to love so dearly from the first
let the #tear# which fell and the broken #word# which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans be sacred
joy and grief were mingled in the cup but there were no bitter #tear# for even grief itself arose so softened and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections that it became a solemn pleasure and lost all character of pain
$miss_rose$ #dear# darling $miss_rose$ a father sister and #mother# were gained and lost in that #one# #moment# they were a long long #time# alone
a soft tap at the #door# at #length# announced that some #one# was without $oliver_twist$ opened it glided away and gave #place# to $harry_maylie$
i know it all he said taking a seat beside the lovely #girl# #dear# $miss_rose$ i know it all
i am not here by accident he added after a lengthened #silence# nor have i heard all this to #night# for i knew it yesterday only yesterday
do you guess that i have come to remind you of a promise stay said $miss_rose$ you do know all
all you gave me leave at any #time# within a #year# to renew the subject of our last discourse i did
not to press you to alter your determination pursued the young #man# but to hear you repeat it if you would
i was to lay whatever of station or fortune i might possess at your #foot# and if you still adhered to your former determination i pledged myself by no #word# or act to seek to change it
if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her whose goodness saved me from a #life# of indigence and suffering when should i ever feel it as i should to #night#
it is a struggle said $miss_rose$ but #one# i am proud to make it is a pang but #one# my #heart# shall bear
the same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now said $miss_rose$ firmly the disclosure of to #night# $harry_maylie$ began
the disclosure of to #night# replied $miss_rose$ softly leaves me in the same position with reference to you as that in which i stood before
you harden your #heart# against me $miss_rose$ urged her lover oh $harry_maylie$ harry said the young #lady# bursting into #tear# i wish i could and spare myself this pain
then why inflict it on yourself said $harry_maylie$ taking her #hand# think #dear# $miss_rose$ think what you have heard to #night#
that a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all there we have said enough $harry_maylie$ we have said enough
and what have i heard what have i heard cried $miss_rose$ not yet not yet said the young #man# detaining her as she $miss_rose$
my hopes my wishes prospects feeling every #thought# in #life# except my love for you have undergone a change i offer you now no distinction among a bustling crowd
no mingling with a world of malice and detraction where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame but a home a #heart# and home yes dearest $miss_rose$ and those and those alone are all i have to offer
i mean but this that when i left you last i left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me resolved that if my world could not be yours i would make yours mine that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you for i would turn from it
what do you mean she faltered this i have done those who have shrunk from me because of this have shrunk from you and proved you so far right
such power and patronage such relatives of influence and rank as smiled upon me then #look# coldly now but there are smiling fields and waving trees in england richest county and by #one# village church mine $miss_rose$ my own there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of than all the hopes i have renounced measured a thousandfold
it a trying #thing# waiting supper for lovers said $mr_grimwig$ waking up and pulling his #pocket# handkerchief from over his #head#
this is my rank and station now and here i lay it down truth to tell the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable #time#
i had serious #thought# of eating my #head# to #night# said $mr_grimwig$ for i began to think i should get #nothing# else
neither $mrs_maylie$ nor $harry_maylie$ nor $miss_rose$ who all came in together could offer a #word# in extenuation i ll take the liberty if you ll allow me of saluting the bride that is to be
$mr_grimwig$ lost no #time# in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing #girl# and the example being contagious was followed both by the #doctor# and $mr_brownlow$ some #people# affirm that $harry_maylie$ had been observed to set it originally in a dark #room# adjoining but the best authorities consider this downright scandal he being young and a clergyman
$oliver_twist$ my #child# said $mrs_maylie$ where have you been and why do you #look# so sad there are #tear# stealing down your #face# at this #moment#
it is a world of disappointment often to the hopes we most cherish and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour
what is the #matter# poor $dick$ was dead #chapter# lii $mr_fagin$ last #night# alive the court was paved from floor to roof with human #face#
from the rail before the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest #corner# in the galleries all #look# were fixed upon #one# #man# $mr_fagin$
before him and behind above below on the right and on the left he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament all bright with gleaming #eye#
he stood there in all this glare of living #light# with #one# #hand# resting on the wooden slab before him the other held to his ear and his #head# thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every #word# that fell from the presiding judge who was delivering his charge to the jury
at #time# he turned his #eye# sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness looked towards his counsel in mute appeal that he would even then urge #something# in his behalf
inquisitive and eager #eye# peered from every inch of space beyond these manifestations of anxiety he stirred not #hand# or #foot#
he had scarcely moved since the trial began and now that the judge ceased to speak he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention with his gaze bent on him as though he listened still
a slight bustle in the court recalled him to himself looking round he saw that the juryman had turned together to consider their verdict
as his #eye# wandered to the gallery he could see the #people# rising above each other to see his #face# some hastily applying their glasses to their #eye# and others whispering their neighbours with #look# expressive of abhorrence
a few there were who seemed unmindful of him and looked only to the jury in impatient wonder how they could delay
but in no #one# #face# not even among the #woman# of whom there were many there could he read the faintest sympathy with himself or any feeling but #one# of all absorbing interest that he should be condemned
as he saw all this in #one# bewildered glance the deathlike stillness came again and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge
he looked wistfully into their #face# #one# by #one# when they passed out as though to see which #way# the greater number leant but that was fruitless
hush they only sought permission to retire the jailer touched him on the shoulder he followed mechanically to the end of the dock and sat down on a #chair#
the #man# pointed it out or he would not have seen it he looked up into the gallery again some of the #people# were eating and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs for the crowded #place# was very hot
he wondered whether it was like and looked on when the artist broke his pencil point and made another with his knife as any idle spectator might have done
in the same #way# when he turned his #eye# towards the judge his #mind# began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress and what it cost and how he put it on
there was an old fat #gentleman# on the bench too who had gone out some half an #hour# before and now come back
he wondered within himself whether this #man# had been to get his dinner what he had had and where he had had it and pursued this train of careless #thought# until some new object caught his #eye# and roused another
not that all this #time# his #mind# was for an instant free from #one# oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his #foot# it was ever present to him but in a vague and general #way# and he could not fix his #thought# upon it
thus even while he trembled and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy #death# he fell to counting the iron spikes before him and wondering how the #head# of #one# had been broken off and whether they would mend it or leave it as it was
then he #thought# of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold and stopped to watch a #man# sprinkling the floor to cool it and then went on to think again
there was #one# young #man# sketching his #face# in a little note #book# at #length# there was a cry of #silence# and a breathless #look# from all towards the #door#
the jury returned and passed him close he could glean #nothing# from their #face# they might as well have been of stone
the building rang with a tremendous shout and another and another and then it echoed loud groans that gathered strength as they swelled out like angry thunder
perfect stillness ensued not a rustle not a breath guilty it was a peal of joy from the populace outside greeting the news that he would die on monday
the noise subsided and he was asked if he had #anything# to say why sentence of #death# should not be passed upon him
he had resumed his listening attitude and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it and then he only muttered that he was an old #man# an old #man# and
so dropping into a whisper was silent again the judge assumed the black cap and the prisoner still stood with the same #air# and gesture
a #woman# in the gallery uttered some exclamation called forth by this dread solemnity he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption and bent forward yet more attentively
the address was solemn and impressive the sentence fearful to hear but he stood like a marble figure without the motion of a nerve
his haggard #face# was still thrust forward his under jaw hanging down and his #eye# staring out before him when the jailer put his #hand# upon his #arm# and beckoned him away
they led him through a paved #room# under the court where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came and others were talking to their #friend# who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard
there was nobody there to speak to him but as he passed the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the #people# who were clinging to the bars and they assailed him with opprobrious #name# and screeched and hissed
he shook his fist and would have spat upon them but his conductors hurried him on through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps into the interior of the prison
here he was searched that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law this ceremony performed they led him to #one# of the condemned cells and left him there alone
he sat down on a stone bench opposite the #door# which served for seat and bedstead and casting his blood shot #eye# upon the #ground# tried to collect his #thought#
after awhile he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said though it had seemed to him at the #time# that he could not hear a #word#
these gradually fell into their proper #place# and by degrees suggested more so that in a little #time# he had the whole almost as it was delivered
he gazed stupidly about him for an instant and obeyed to be hanged by the neck till he was dead that was the end
as it came on very dark he began to think of all the #man# he had known who had died upon the scaffold some of them through his means
to be hanged by the neck till he was dead they $miss_rose$ up in such quick succession that he could hardly count them
with what a rattling noise the drop went down and how suddenly they changed from strong and vigorous #man# to dangling heaps of clothes
he had seen some of them die and had joked too because they died with prayers upon their lips some of them might have inhabited that very cell sat upon that very spot
it was very dark why didnt they bring a #light# the cell had been built for many #year# scores of #man# must have passed their last #hour# there
it was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies the cap the noose the pinioned #arm# the #face# that he knew even beneath that hideous veil #light# light
#one# bearing a candle which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the #night# for the prisoner was to be left alone no more
at #length# when his #hand# were raw with beating against the heavy #door# and walls two #man# appeared then came the #night# dark dismal silent #night#
other watchers are glad to hear this church clock strike for they tell of #life# and coming #day# to him they brought despair
the boom of every iron bell came laden with the #one# deep hollow sound #death# what availed the noise and bustle of cheerful #morning# which penetrated even there to him
there was no #day# it was gone as soon as come and #night# came on again #night# so long and yet so short long in its dreadful #silence# and short in its fleeting #hour#
it was another form of knell with mockery added to the warning the #day# passed off #day# at #one# #time# he raved and blasphemed and at another howled and tore his hair
venerable #man# of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him but he had driven them away with curses they renewed their charitable efforts and he beat them off
it was not until the #night# of this last awful #day# that a withering sense of his helpless desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon
he had spoken little to either of the two #man# who relieved each other in their attendance upon him and they for their #part# made no effort to rouse his attention
saturday #night# he had only #one# #night# more to live and as he #thought# of this the #day# broke sunday he had sat there awake but dreaming
now he started up every #minute# and with gasping mouth and burning skin hurried to and fro in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they used to such sights recoiled from him with horror
he grew so terrible at last in all the tortures of his evil conscience that #one# #man# could not bear to sit there eyeing him alone and so the two kept watch together
he had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the #day# of his capture and his #head# was bandaged with a linen cloth
his red hair hung down upon his bloodless #face# his beard was torn and twisted into knots his #eye# shone with a terrible #light# his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up
if it was not a trick to frighten him and those were the real #hour# treading on each other heels where would he be when they came round again
he cowered down upon his stone #bed# and #thought# of the past eight nine then eleven another struck before the #voice# of the previous #hour# had ceased to vibrate
those dreadful walls of newgate which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish not only from the #eye# but too often and too long from the #thought# of #man# never held so dread a spectacle as that
the few who lingered as they passed and wondered what the #man# was doing who was to be hanged to morrow would have slept but ill that #night# if they could have seen him
from early in the evening until nearly midnight little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge gate and inquired with anxious #face# whether any reprieve had been received
these being answered in the negative communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the #street# who pointed out to #one# another the #door# from which he must come out and showed where the scaffold would be built and walking with unwilling steps away turned back to conjure up the scene
by degrees they fell off #one# by #one# and for an #hour# in the dead of #night# the #street# was left to solitude and darkness
the space before the prison was cleared and a few strong barriers painted black had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd when $mr_brownlow$ and $oliver_twist$ appeared at the wicket and presented an order of admission to the prisoner signed by #one# of the sheriffs
at eight he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train at eleven they were immediately admitted into the lodge
is the young #gentleman# to come too #sir# said the #man# whose duty it was to conduct them it not a sight for #child# #sir#
it is not indeed my #friend# rejoined $mr_brownlow$ but my business with this #man# is intimately connected with him and as this #child# has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy i think it as well even at the cost of some pain and fear that he should see him now
the #man# touched his #hat# and glancing at $oliver_twist$ with some curiousity opened another gate opposite to that by which they had entered and led them on through dark and winding #way# towards the cells
this said the #man# stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound #silence# this is the #place# he passes through
these few #word# had been said apart so as to be inaudible to $oliver_twist$ if you step this #way# you can see the #door# he goes out at
there was an open grating above it through which came the sound of #man# #voice# mingled with the noise of hammering and the throwing down of boards
he led them into a stone kitchen fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food and pointed to a #door# they were putting up the scaffold
from this #place# they passed through several strong gates opened by other turnkeys from the inner #side# and having entered an open yard ascended a flight of narrow steps and came into a passage with a row of strong #door# on the left #hand#
the two attendants after a little whispering came out into the passage stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell
motioning them to remain where they were the turnkey knocked at #one# of these with his bunch of keys they did so
the condemned criminal was seated on his #bed# rocking himself from #side# to #side# with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the #face# of a #man#
his #mind# was evidently wandering to his old #life# for he continued to mutter without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a #part# of his vision
good #boy# $charley_bates$ well done he mumbled $oliver_twist$ too ha ha ha $oliver_twist$ too quite the #gentleman# now quite the take that #boy# away to #bed#
the jailer took the disengaged #hand# of $oliver_twist$ and whispering him not to be alarmed looked on without speaking take him away to #bed#
cried $mr_fagin$ do you hear me some of you he has been the the somehow the cause of all this it worth the money to bring him up to it
bolter throat $bill_sikes$ never #mind# the #girl# bolter throat as deep as you can cut saw his #head# off $mr_fagin$ said the jailer
an old #man# my lord a very old old #man# here said the turnkey laying his #hand# upon his breast to keep him down
that me cried the jew falling instantly into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial here somebody wants to see you to ask you some questions i suppose
i shant be #one# long he replied looking up with a #face# retaining no human expression but rage and terror
$mr_fagin$ $mr_fagin$ are you a #man# strike them all dead what right have they to butcher me as he spoke he caught sight of $oliver_twist$ and $mr_brownlow$
shrinking to the furthest #corner# of the seat he demanded to know what they wanted there steady said the turnkey still holding him down
now #sir# tell him what you want quick if you please for he grows worse as the #time# gets on
you have some papers said $mr_brownlow$ advancing which were placed in your #hand# for better security by a #man# called monks
for the love of god said $mr_brownlow$ solemnly do not say that now upon the very verge of #death# but tell me where they are
it all a lie together replied $mr_fagin$ i havent #one# not #one# you know that $mr_william_sikes$ is dead that monks has confessed that there is no hope of any further gain
where are those papers $oliver_twist$ cried $mr_fagin$ beckoning to him here here let me whisper to you i am not afraid said $oliver_twist$ in a low #voice# as he relinquished $mr_brownlow$ #hand#
the papers said $mr_fagin$ drawing $oliver_twist$ towards him are in a canvas bag in a hole a little #way# up the chimney in the top front #room#
i want to talk to you my #dear# i want to talk to you yes yes returned $oliver_twist$ let me say a prayer
do let me say #one# prayer say only #one# upon your knees with me and we will talk till #morning#
outside outside replied $mr_fagin$ pushing the #boy# before him towards the #door# and looking vacantly over his #head# say i ve gone to sleep they ll believe you
you can get me out if you take me so now then now then oh god forgive this wretched #man# cried the #boy# with a burst of #tear#
that right that right said $mr_fagin$ that ll help us on this #door# first if i shake and tremble as we pass the gallows dont you #mind# but hurry on
now now now have you #nothing# else to ask him #sir# inquired the turnkey no other question replied $mr_brownlow$
if i hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position #nothing# will do that #sir# replied the #man# shaking his #head#
you had better leave him the #door# of the cell opened and the attendants returned press on press on cried $mr_fagin$
softly but not so slow faster faster the #man# laid #hand# upon him and disengaging $oliver_twist$ from his grasp held him back
he struggled with the power of desperation for an instant and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard
$oliver_twist$ nearly swooned after this frightful scene and was so weak that for an #hour# or more he had not the strength to walk
a great multitude had already assembled the #window# were filled with #people# smoking and playing cards to beguile the #time# the crowd were pushing quarrelling joking
everything told of #life# and animation but #one# dark cluster of objects in the centre of all the black stage the cross beam the rope and all the hideous apparatus of #death#
it was some #time# before they left the prison #day# was dawning when they again emerged #chapter# liii and last the fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed
before three months had passed $miss_rose$ fleming and $harry_maylie$ were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman labours on the same #day# they entered into possession of their new and happy home
$mrs_maylie$ took up her abode with her son and daughter in law to enjoy during the tranquil remainder of her #day# the greatest felicity that age and worth can know the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well spent #life# have been unceasingly bestowed
it appeared on full and careful investigation that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of monks which had never prospered either in his #hand# or in those of his #mother# were equally divided between himself and $oliver_twist$ it would yield to each little more than three thousand pounds
by the provisions of his father will $oliver_twist$ would have been entitled to the whole but $mr_brownlow$ unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career proposed this mode of distribution to which his young charge joyfully acceded
monks still bearing that assumed #name# retired with his portion to a distant #part# of the new world where having quickly squandered it he once more fell into his old courses and after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery at #length# sunk under an attack of his old disorder and died in prison
the little that remains to their historian to relate is told in few and simple #word# as far from home died the chief remaining members of his #friend# $mr_fagin$ gang
removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage #house# where his #dear# #friend# resided he gratified the only remaining wish of $oliver_twist$ warm and earnest #heart# and thus linked together a little society whose condition approached as nearly to #one# of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world
soon after the marriage of the young #people# the worthy #doctor# returned to chertsey where bereft of the presence of his old #friend# he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how
for two or three months he contented himself with hinting that he feared the #air# began to disagree with him then finding that the #place# really no longer was to him what it had been he settled his business on his assistant took a bachelor cottage outside the village of which his young #friend# was pastor and instantaneously recovered
$mr_brownlow$ adopted $oliver_twist$ as his son here he took to gardening planting fishing carpentering and various other pursuits of a similar kind
all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity in each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood as a most profound authority
before his removal he had managed to contract a strong friendship for $mr_grimwig$ which that eccentric #gentleman# cordially reciprocated he is accordingly visited by $mr_grimwig$ a great many #time# in the course of the #year#
on all such occasions $mr_grimwig$ plants fishes and carpenters with great ardour doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented #manner# but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration that his mode is the right #one#
on sundays he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman #face# always informing $mr_losberne$ in strict confidence afterwards that he considers it an excellent performance but deems it as well not to say so
it is a standing and very favourite joke for $mr_brownlow$ to rally him on his old prophecy concerning $oliver_twist$ and to remind him of the #night# on which they sat with the watch between them waiting his return but $mr_grimwig$ contends that he was right in the main and in proof thereof remarks that $oliver_twist$ did not come back after all which always calls forth a laugh on his #side# and increases his good humour
$mr_noah_claypole$ receiving a free pardon from the crown in consequence of being admitted approver against $mr_fagin$ and considering his profession not altogether as safe a #one# as he could wish was for some little #time# at a loss for the means of a livelihood not burdened with too much work
after some consideration he went into business as an informer in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence his plan is to walk out once a week during church #time# attended by $charlotte$ in respectable attire
the #lady# faints away at the #door# of charitable publicans and the #gentleman# being accommodated with three penny worth of brandy to restore her lays an information next #day# and #pocket# half the penalty
mr and mrs $mr_bumble$ deprived of their situations were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others
$mr_bumble$ has been heard to say that in this reverse and degradation he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife
as to $mr_giles$ and brittles they still remain in their old posts although the former is bald and the last named #boy# quite grey
they sleep at the parsonage but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates and $oliver_twist$ and $mr_brownlow$ and $mr_losberne$ that to this #day# the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong
#master# charles $charley_bates$ appalled by $mr_william_sikes$ crime fell into a train of reflection whether an honest #life# was not after all the best
arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was he turned his back upon the scenes of the past resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action
he struggled hard and suffered much for some #time# but having a contented disposition and a good purpose succeeded in the end and from being a farmer drudge and a carrier lad he is now the merriest young grazier in all northamptonshire
and now the #hand# that traces these #word# falters as it approaches the conclusion of its task and would weave for a little longer space the thread of these adventures
i would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom i have so long moved and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it
i would show $miss_rose$ maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood shedding on her secluded path in #life# soft and gentle #light# that fell on all who trod it with her and shone into their #heart#
i would paint her the #life# and joy of the #fire# #side# circle and the lively summer group i would follow her through the sultry fields at noon and hear the low tones of her sweet #voice# in the moonlit evening walk i would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home i would paint her and her dead sister #child# happy in their love for #one# another and passing whole #hour# together in picturing the #friend# whom they had so sadly lost i would summon before me once again those joyous little #face# that clustered round her knee and listen to their merry prattle i would recall the tones of that clear laugh and conjure up the sympathising #tear# that glistened in the soft blue #eye#
sometimes $mr_noah_claypole$ faints himself but the result is the same these and a thousand #look# and smiles and turns of #thought# and speech
how $mr_brownlow$ went on from #day# to #day# filling the #mind# of his adopted #child# with stores of knowledge and becoming attached to him more and more as his nature developed itself and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become how he traced in him new traits of his early #friend# that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances melancholy and yet sweet and soothing how the two orphans tried by adversity remembered its lessons in mercy to others and mutual love and fervent thanks to him who had protected and preserved them
i would fain recall them every #one# these are all #matter# which need not to be told i have said that they were truly happy and without strong affection and humanity of #heart# and gratitude to that
being whose code is mercy and whose great attribute is benevolence to all #thing# that breathe happiness can never be attained
within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet which bears as yet but #one# #word# agnes
there is no coffin in that tomb and may it be many many #year# before another #name# is placed above it
but if the spirits of the dead ever come back to earth to visit spots hallowed by the love the love beyond the grave of those whom they knew in #life# i believe that the shade of agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook
