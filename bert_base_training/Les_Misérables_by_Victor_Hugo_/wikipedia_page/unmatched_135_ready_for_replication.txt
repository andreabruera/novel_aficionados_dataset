french historical novel by victor hugo first published in that is considered #one# of the greatest novels of the #century# in the english speaking #world# the novel is usually referred to by its original french title
however several alternatives have been used including the miserables the wretched the miserable #one# the poor #one# the wretched poor the victims and the dispossessed
#beginning# in and culminating in the june rebellion in paris the novel follows the #life# and interactions of several characters particularly the struggles of ex #convict# $jean_valjean$ and his experience of redemption
examining the #nature# of #law# and grace the novel elaborates upon the #history# of france the architecture and urban design of paris politics moral #philosophy# antimonarchism #justice# religion and the types and #nature# of romantic and familial #love#
les misérables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film television and the stage including musical volume iv the idyll in the rue plumet and the epic in the rue st denis towards the #end# of the novel
hugo explains the #work# overarching structure the #book# which the #reader# has before him at this #moment# is from #one# #end# to the #other# in its entirety and #detail# a #progress# from #evil# to #good# from injustice to #justice# from falsehood to #truth# from #night# to #day# from appetite to #conscience# from corruption to #life# from bestiality to #duty# from hell to heaven from nothingness to god
the novel contains various subplots but the main #thread# is the #story# of ex #convict# $jean_valjean$ who becomes #force# for #good# in the #world# but cannot #escape# his criminal #past#
the novel is divided into five volumes each volume divided into several #book# and subdivided into #chapter# for total of #book# and #chapter#
the starting #point# #matter# destination the #soul# the hydra at the #beginning# the #angel# at the #end# each #chapter# is relatively short commonly no longer than few pages
the novel as #whole# is #one# of the longest ever written and pages in french i dont know whether it #will# be read by everyone but it is meant for everyone
it #address# england as well as spain italy as well as france germany as well as ireland the republics that harbour slaves as well as empires that have serfs
humankind #wound# those huge sores that litter the #world# do not stop at the blue and red #line# drawn on maps
wherever #man# go in ignorance or #despair# wherever #woman# sell themselves for #bread# wherever #child# lack #book# to learn from or warm hearth les misérables knocks at the #door# and says open up am here for you
is devoted to essays that argue moral #point# or display hugo encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot nor even subplot method hugo used in such #other# #work# as the hunchback of notre dame and toilers of the #sea#
more than #quarter# of the novel by #one# count of pages #one# biographer noted that the digressions of genius are easily pardoned
the topics hugo #address# include cloistered religious #order# the construction of the paris #sewer# argot and the #street# urchins of paris
he devotes another #chapter# volume ii #book# i to an #account# of and meditation on the #place# in #history# of the #battle# of waterloo the battlefield which hugo visited in and where he finished writing the novel
the #one# about #convent# he titles parenthesis to alert the #reader# to its irrelevance to the #story# #line# it opens volume with such #change# of #subject# as to seem the #beginning# of an entirely different #work#
the #fact# that this digression occupies such large #part# of the text demands that it be read in the context of the overarching structure discussed above
hugo draws his own personal conclusions taking waterloo to be pivot #point# in #history# but definitely not victory for the #force# of reaction
waterloo by cutting short the demolition of european thrones by the #sword# had no #other# #effect# than to cause the revolutionary #work# to be continued in another #direction#
the slashers have finished it was the #turn# of the thinkers the #century# that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its #march#
#one# critic has called this the spiritual gateway to the novel as its #chance# encounter of thénardier and #colonel# $georges_pontmercy$ foreshadows so many of the novel encounters blending #chance# and #necessity# confrontation of heroism and villainy
even when not turning to #other# #subject# outside his narrative hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of #event# his #voice# and control of the #story# #line# unconstrained by #time# and sequence
that sinister victory was vanquished by #liberty# the novel opens with statement about the $bishop$ of digne in and immediately shifts
only after #chapter# does hugo pick up the opening #thread# again in the early #day# of the #month# of october to introduce $jean_valjean$
although these #detail# in no #way# essentially concern that which we have to tell eugène vidocq whose career provided model for the character of $jean_valjean$
an incident hugo witnessed in involved three #stranger# and #police# #officer# #one# of the #stranger# was #man# who had stolen loaf of #bread# similar to $jean_valjean$
the #thief# also saw the $mother_catherine_de_bar$ and #daughter# playing with each #other# which would be an inspiration for fantine and $mademoiselle_cosette$
the #officer# was taking him to the coach hugo imagined the #life# of the #man# in jail and the $mother_catherine_de_bar$ and #daughter# taken away from each #other#
$jean_valjean$ character is loosely based on the #life# of the ex #convict# eugène françois vidocq vidocq became the #head# of an undercover #police# unit and later founded france first private detective agency
vidocq also inspired hugo as he wrote claude gueux and le dernier jour un condamné the last #day# of condemned #man#
in vidocq already pardoned saved #one# of the workers in his #paper# factory by lifting heavy #cart# on his #shoulder# as $jean_valjean$ does
hugo description of $jean_valjean$ rescuing sailor on the orion drew almost #word# for #word# on baron la roncière #letter# describing such an incident
hugo used $monseigneur_bienvenu$ de miollis the $bishop$ of digne during the #time# in which $jean_valjean$ encounters $m_myriel$ as the model for $m_myriel$
hugo had used the #departure# of #prisoner# from the bagne of toulon in #one# of his early #story# le dernier jour un condamné
he went to toulon to visit the bagne in and took extensive #note# though he did not start writing the #book# until
on #one# of the pages of his #note# about the #prison# he wrote in large block #letter# possible #name# for his hero
he was also businessman and was widely noted for his social engagement and philanthropy $jean_valjean$ tréjean when the #book# was finally written tréjean became $jean_valjean$
in hugo saved prostitute from arrest for assault he used short #part# of his dialogue with the #police# when recounting $jean_valjean$ rescue of fantine in the novel
on february when he had begun #work# on the novel hugo witnessed the arrest of #bread# #thief# while duchess and her #child# watched the scene pitilessly from their coach
he spent several vacations in montreuil sur mer which became the model for the #town# he calls sur
during the #revolt# hugo walked the #street# of paris saw the #barricade# blocking his #way# at #point# and had to take shelter from gunfire
he participated more directly in the paris #insurrection# helping to smash #barricade# and suppress both the popular #revolt# and its monarchist allies
in december he witnessed an altercation between an old #woman# scavenging through rubbish and #street# urchin who might have been $monsieur_gavroche$
victor hugo drew his inspiration from #everything# he heard and saw writing it down in his diary he also informed himself by personal inspection of the paris conciergerie in
and waterloo in by gathering information on some industries and on working class #people# wages and #living# standards he asked his mistresses léonie aunet and juliette drouet to tell him about #life# in #convent#
for instance $marius_haggard$ and $mademoiselle_cosette$ #wedding# #night# #part# #book# #chapter# takes #place# on february which is also the date when hugo and his lifelong mistress juliette drouet made #love# for the first #time#
the #story# begins in in digne as the #peasant# $jean_valjean$ just released from #year# imprisonment in the bagne of toulon five for stealing #bread# for his starving #sister# and her #family# and fourteen more for numerous #escape# attempts is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as former #convict#
he also slipped personal anecdotes into the plot he sleeps on the #street# angry and bitter digne benevolent $bishop$ $m_myriel$ gives him shelter
when the #police# capture $jean_valjean$ $m_myriel$ pretends that he has given the silverware to $jean_valjean$ and presses him to take two #silver# candlesticks as well as if he had forgotten to take them
$m_myriel$ tells $jean_valjean$ that his #life# has been spared for god and that he should #use# #money# from the #silver# candlesticks to make an honest #man# of himself
when opportunity presents itself purely out of #habit# he steals sous coin from #year# old petit $little_gervais$ and chases the #boy# away
at #night# $jean_valjean$ runs off with $m_myriel$ silverware the #police# accept his explanation and #leave# he quickly repents and searches the #city# in panic for $little_gervais$
$jean_valjean$ hides as they search for him because if apprehended he #will# be returned to the #galley# for #life# as repeat offender
