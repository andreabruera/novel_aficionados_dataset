the morte $king_arthur_s_court$ was finished as the epilogue tells us in the ninth year of edward iv i between march and the same date in
it is thus fitly enough the last important english book written before the introduction of printing into this country and since no manuscript of it has come down to us it is also the first english classic for our knowledge of which we are entirely dependent on a printed text
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ at a #tournament# bare the shield that $queen_morgan_le_fay$ delivered to him bibliographical note $william_caxton$ story of how the book was brought to him
from this we learn also that he was not only the printer of the book but to some extent its editor also dividing $thomas_malory$ work into twenty one books splitting up the books into chapters by no #mean# skilfully and supplying the rubrish or chapter headings
it may be added that $william_caxton$ preface contains moreover a brief criticism which on the points on which it touches is still the soundest and most sympathetic that has been written
and he was induced to print it may be read farther on in his own preface $william_caxton$ finished his edition the last #day# of july some fifteen or sixteen years after $thomas_malory$ wrote his epilogue
it is clear that the author was then dead or the printer would not have acted as a clumsy editor to the book and recent discoveries if bibliography may for the moment enlarge its bounds to mention such matters have revealed with tolerable certainty when $thomas_malory$ died and who he was
in letters to the athenaeum in july mrt williams pointed out that the name of a sir thomas malorie occurred among those of a number of other lancastrians excluded from a general pardon granted by edward iv in and that a william mallerye was mentioned in the same year as taking part in a lancastrian rising
in september again in another letter to the same paper mr at martin reported the finding of the will of a $thomas_malory$ of papworth a hundred partly in cambridgeshire partly in hunts
this will was made on september and as it was proved the th of the next month the testator must have been in immediate expectation of death
it contains the most careful provision for the education and starting in life of a family of three daughters and seven sons of whom the youngest seems to have been still an infant
we cannot say with certainty that this $thomas_malory$ whose last thoughts were so busy for his children was our author or that the lancastrian $black_knight$ discovered by mr williams was identical with either or both but such evidence as the morte $king_arthur_s_court$ offers favours such a belief
there is not only the epilogue with its petition pray for me while i am alive that god send me good deliverance and when i am dead pray you all for my #soul# but this very request is foreshadowed at the end of chap
in the touching passage surely inspired by personal experience as to the sickness that is the greatest pain a #prisoner# may have and the reflections on english fickleness in the first chapter of book xxi though the #war# of the roses might have inspired them in any one come most naturally from an author who was a lancastrian $black_knight$
if the morte $king_arthur_s_court$ was really written in prison and by a #prisoner# distressed by ill health as well as by lack of liberty surely no task was ever better devised to while away weary hours
leaving abundant scope for originality in selection modification and arrangement as a compilation and translation it had in it that mechanical element which adds the touch of restfulness to literary work
no original it is said has yet been found for book vii and it is possible that #none# will ever be forthcoming for chap
of book xviii which describes the arrival of the body of the fair #maiden# of astolat at $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# or vii for chap
of the same book with its discourse on true love but the great bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter to the $merlin_gat_excalibur$ of robert de borron and his successors bks i iv the english metrical romance la morte $king_arthur_s_court$ of the thornton manuscript
of book ix bk the french romances of tristan bks viii and of $launcelot_du_lake$ bks vi xi xix and lastly to the english prose morte $king_arthur_s_court$ of harley ms
as to $thomas_malory$ choice of his authorities critics have not failed to point out that now and again he gives a worse version where a better has come down to us and if he had been able to order a complete set of arthurian manuscripts from his bookseller no doubt he would have done even better than he did
but of the skill approaching to original genius with which he used the books from which he worked there is little dispute
$thomas_malory$ died leaving his work obviously unrevised and in this condition it was brought to $william_caxton$ who prepared it for the press with his usual enthusiasm in the #cause# of good literature and also it must be added with his usual carelessness
new chapters are sometimes made to begin in the middle of a sentence and in addition to simple misprints there are numerous passages in which it is impossible to believe that we have the text as $thomas_malory$ intended it to stand
after $william_caxton$ edition $thomas_malory$ manuscript must have disappeared and subsequent editions are differentiated only by the degree of closeness with which they follow the first
editions appeared printed by wynkyn de worde in and by william copland in by thomas east about and by thomas stansby in each printer apparently taking the text of his immediate predecessor and reproducing it with modifications
stansby edition served for reprints in and the latter edited by thomas wright but in an edition supervised by robert southey went back to $william_caxton$ text though to a copy only two are extant and only one perfect in which eleven leaves were supplied from wynkyn de worde reprint
in sir edward strachey produced for the present publishers a reprint of southey text in modern spelling with the substitution of current words for those now obsolete and the softening of a handful of passages likely he thought to prevent the book being placed in the hands of #boy#
in a boon was conferred on scholars by the publication of dr oskar sommer #page# for #page# reprint of $william_caxton$ text with an elaborate discussion of $thomas_malory$ sources
dr sommer edition was used by sir strachey to revise his globe text and in mr israel gollancz produced for the temple classics a very pretty edition in which sir edward strachey principles of modernisation in spelling and punctuation were adopted but with the restoration of obsolete words and omitted phrases
bks xviii #xx# xxi as to the present edition sir edward strachey altered with so sparing a hand
and that here printed will be looked for in vain but the most anxious care has been taken to produce a text modernised as to its spelling but in other respects in accurate accordance with $william_caxton$ text as represented by dr sommer reprint
obvious misprints have been silently corrected but in a few cases notes show where emendations have been introduced from wynkyn de worde not that wynkyn had any more right to emend $william_caxton$ than we but because even a printer conjecture gains a little sanctity after four centuries
the restoration of obsolete words has necessitated a much fuller glossary and the index of names has therefore been separated from it and enlarged
that on many #page# differences between his version in its present form the index is the work of mr henry littlehales
preface of $william_caxton$ after that i had accomplished and finished #diver# histories as well of contemplation as of other historial and worldly #act# of great conquerors and princes and also certain books of ensamples and doctrine many noble and #diver# #gentleman# of this realm of england came and demanded me many and oft times wherefore that i have not do made and imprint the noble history of the saint greal and of the most renowned christian $king_arthur_s_court$ first and chief of the three best christian and worthy $king_arthur_s_court$ which ought most to be remembered among us englishmen to #fore# all other christian #king# for it is notoyrly known through the universal world that there be nine worthy and the best that ever were that is to #wit# three paynims three jews and three christian men
as for the paynims they were to #fore# the incarnation of christ which were named the first hector of troy of whom the history is comen both in ballad and in prose the second alexander the great and the third julius caesar emperor of rome of whom the histories be well known and had
and as for the three jews which also were to #fore# the incarnation of our lord of whom the first was duke joshua which brought the children of israel into the #land# of behest the second david $king_arthur_s_court$ of jerusalem and the third judas machabeus of these three the bible rehearseth all their noble histories and #act#
and since the said incarnation have been three noble christian men stalled and admitted through the universal world into the number of the nine best and worthy
a pollard of whom was first the noble $king_arthur_s_court$ whose noble #act# i purpose to write in this present book here following
the second was charlemain or charles the great of whom the history is had in many places both in french and in english
and the third and last was godfrey of boloine of whose #act# and life i made a book unto the excellent prince and $king_arthur_s_court$ of noble memory $king_arthur_s_court$ edward the fourth
the said noble #gentleman# instantly required me to imprint the history of the said noble $king_arthur_s_court$ and conqueror $king_arthur_s_court$ and of his #knight# with the history of the saint greal and of the death and ending of the said $king_arthur_s_court$ affirming that i ought rather to imprint his #act# and noble #feat# than of godfrey of boloine or any of the other eight considering that he was a man born within this realm and $king_arthur_s_court$ and emperor of the same and that there be in french #diver# and many noble volumes of his #act# and also of his #knight#
to whom i answered that #diver# men hold opinion that there was no such $king_arthur_s_court$ and that all such books as been made of him be feigned and fables because that some chronicles make of him no mention nor remember him nothing nor of his #knight#
whereto they answered and one in special said that in him that should say or think that there was never such a $king_arthur_s_court$ called $king_arthur_s_court$ might well be aretted great folly and blindness
for he said that there were many evidences of the contrary first #ye# may see his sepulchre in the monastery of glastonbury
and also in policronicon in the fifth book the sixth chapter and in the seventh book the twenty third chapter where his body was buried and after found and translated into the said monastery
#ye# shall see also in the history of bochas in his book de casu principum part of his noble #act# and also of his fall
also galfridus in his british book recounteth his life and in #diver# places of england many remembrances be yet of him and shall remain perpetually and also of his #knight#
first in the abbey of westminster at st edward shrine remaineth the print of his seal in red wax closed in beryl in which is written patricius arthurus britannie gallie germanie dacie imperator
item in the castle of dover #ye# may see $sir_gawaine$ skull and cradok #mantle# at winchester the round table in other places $launcelot_du_lake$ sword and many other #thing#
then all these #thing# considered there can no man reasonably gainsay but there was a $king_arthur_s_court$ of this #land# named $king_arthur_s_court$
for in all places christian and heathen he is reputed and taken for one of the nine worthy and the first of the three christian men
more books made of his noble #act# than there be in england as well in dutch italian spanish and greekish as in french
and yet of record remain in witness of him in wales in the town of camelot the great stones and the marvellous works of iron lying under the ground and royal vaults which #diver# now living have seen
wherefore it is a #marvel# why he is no more renowned in his own country save only it accordeth to the word of god which saith that no man is accepted for a prophet in his own country
then all these #thing# aforesaid alleged i could not well deny but that there was such a noble $king_arthur_s_court$ named $king_arthur_s_court$ and reputed one of the nine worthy and first and chief of the christian men
and many noble volumes be made of him and of his noble #knight# in french which i have seen and read beyond the sea which be not had in our maternal tongue
and also he is more spoken of beyond the sea but in welsh be many and also in french and some in english but nowhere #nigh# all
wherefore such as have late been drawn out briefly into english i have after the simple conning that god hath sent to me under the favour and correction of all noble lords and #gentleman# enprised to imprint a book of the noble histories of the said $king_arthur_s_court$ and of certain of his #knight# after a copy unto me delivered which copy sir thomas malorye did take out of certain books of french and reduced it into english
and i according to my copy have done set it in imprint to the intent that noble men may see and learn the noble #act# of chivalry the gentle and virtuous deeds that some #knight# used in those #day# by which they came to honour and how they that were vicious were punished and oft put to shame and #rebuke# humbly beseeching all noble lords and #lady# with all other estates of what estate or degree they been of that shall see and read in this said book and work that they take the good and honest #act# in their remembrance and to follow the same
wherein they shall find many joyous and pleasant histories and noble and renowned #act# of humanity gentleness and chivalry for herein may be seen noble chivalry courtesy humanity friendliness hardiness love friendship cowardice murder hate virtue and sin
and for to pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in but for to give faith and belief that all is true that is contained herein #ye# be at your liberty but all is written for our doctrine and for to beware that we fall not to vice nor sin but to exercise and follow virtue by which we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this life and after this short and transitory life to come unto everlasting bliss in heaven the which he grant us that reigneth in heaven the blessed trinity
then to proceed forth in this said book which i direct unto all noble princes lords and #lady# #gentleman# or gentlewomen that desire to read or hear read of the noble and joyous history of the great conqueror and excellent $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_arthur_s_court$ sometime $king_arthur_s_court$ of this noble realm then called britain i $william_caxton$ simple person present this book following which i have enprised to imprint and treateth of the noble #act# #feat# of #arm# of chivalry prowess hardiness humanity love courtesy and very gentleness with many wonderful histories and adventures
and for to understand briefly the content of this volume i have divided it into xxi books and every book chaptered as hereafter shall by god grace follow

the twentieth book treateth of the piteous death of $king_arthur_s_court$ and containeth xxii chapters book i chapter i how $uther_pendragon$ sent for the duke of cornwall and $lady_igraine$ his #wife# and of their #departing# suddenly again
it befell in the #day# of $uther_pendragon$ when he was $king_arthur_s_court$ of all england and so reigned that there was a mighty duke in cornwall that held #war# against him long time
and so by #mean# $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ sent for this duke charging him to bring his #wife# with him for she was called a fair #lady# and a passing wise and her name was called $lady_igraine$
so when the duke and his #wife# were come unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ by the #mean# of great lords they were accorded both
the $king_arthur_s_court$ liked and loved this #lady# well and he made them great #cheer# out of measure and desired to have lain by her
and the duke was called the duke of tintagil but she was a passing good woman and would not assent unto the $king_arthur_s_court$
and then she told the duke her husband and said i suppose that we were sent for that i should be dishonoured wherefore husband i counsel you that we depart from hence suddenly that we may ride all night unto our own castle
and in like wise as she said so they departed that neither the $king_arthur_s_court$ nor #none# of his council were #ware# of their #departing#
then he called to him his privy council and told them of the sudden #departing# of the duke and his #wife#
then they advised the $king_arthur_s_court$ to send for the duke and his #wife# by a great charge and if he will not come at your summons then may #ye# do your best then have #ye# #cause# to make mighty #war# upon him
so that was done and the #messenger# had their #answer# and that was this shortly that neither he nor his #wife# would not come at him
all so soon as $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ knew of their #departing# so suddenly he was wonderly wroth then was the $king_arthur_s_court$ wonderly wroth
and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ sent him plain word again and bade him be ready and stuff him and garnish him for within forty #day# he would fetch him out of the biggest castle that he hath
when the duke had this warning anon he went and furnished and garnished two strong castles of his of the which the one hight tintagil and the other castle hight terrabil
so his #wife# dame $lady_igraine$ he put in the castle of tintagil and himself he put in the castle of terrabil the which had many issues and posterns out
then in all haste came $uther_pendragon$ with a great host and laid a #siege# about the castle of terrabil and there he pight many #pavilion# and there was great #war# made on both parties and much people slain
then for pure anger and for great love of fair $lady_igraine$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ fell sick so came to the $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ sir $ulfius$ a noble $black_knight$ and asked the $king_arthur_s_court$ why he was sick
i shall tell thee said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i am sick for anger and for love of fair $lady_igraine$ that i may not be whole
well my lord said sir $ulfius$ i shall seek $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and he shall do you remedy that your heart shall be pleased
so $ulfius$ departed and by adventure he met $merlin_gat_excalibur$ in a beggar array and there $merlin_gat_excalibur$ asked $ulfius$ whom he sought
well said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i know whom thou seekest for thou seekest $merlin_gat_excalibur$ therefore seek no farther for i am he and if $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ will well reward me and be sworn unto me to fulfil my desire that shall be his honour and profit more than mine for i shall #cause# him to have all his desire
and he said he had little ado to tell him all this will i undertake said $ulfius$ that there shall be nothing reasonable but thou shalt have thy desire
well said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ he shall have his intent and desire and therefore said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ ride on your #way# for i will not be long behind
how $uther_pendragon$ made #war# on the duke of cornwall and how by the #mean# of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ he lay by the duchess and gat $king_arthur_s_court$
then $ulfius$ was glad and rode on more than a pace till that he came to $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ and told him he had met with $merlin_gat_excalibur$
chapter ii where is he said the $king_arthur_s_court$ sir said $ulfius$ he will not dwell long therewithal $ulfius$ was #ware# where $merlin_gat_excalibur$ stood at the porch of the #pavilion# door
and then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ was bound to come to the $king_arthur_s_court$ when $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ saw him he said he was welcome sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i know all your heart
every deal so #ye# will be sworn unto me as #ye# be a true $king_arthur_s_court$ anointed to fulfil my desire #ye# shall have your desire
the first night that #ye# shall lie by $lady_igraine$ #ye# shall get a child on her and when that is born that it shall be delivered to me for to nourish there as i will have it for it shall be your worship and the child avail as mickle as the child is worth
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ was sworn upon the four evangelists sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ this is my desire i will well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ as thou wilt have it
#ye# shall be like the duke her husband $ulfius$ shall be like sir $brastias$ a $black_knight$ of the duke and i will be like a $black_knight$
now make you ready said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ this night #ye# shall lie with $lady_igraine$ in the castle of tintagil and that hight sir jordanus a $black_knight$ of the duke
but wait #ye# make not many questions with her nor her men but say #ye# are diseased and so hie you to #bed# and rise not on the morn till i come to you for the castle of tintagil is but ten miles hence so this was done as they devised
but the duke of tintagil espied how the $king_arthur_s_court$ rode from the #siege# of terrabil and therefore that night he issued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed the $king_arthur_s_court$ host
and so through his own issue the duke himself was slain or ever the $king_arthur_s_court$ came at the castle of tintagil
so after the death of the duke $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ lay with $lady_igraine$ more than three hours after his death and begat on her that night $king_arthur_s_court$ and on #day# came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and bade him make him ready and so he kissed the $lady_igraine$ and departed in all haste
but when the #lady# heard tell of the duke her husband and by all record he was dead or ever $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ came to her then she marvelled who that might be that lay with her in likeness of her lord so she mourned privily and held her #peace#
then all the barons by one assent prayed the $king_arthur_s_court$ of accord betwixt the $lady_igraine$ and him the $king_arthur_s_court$ gave them leave for fain would he have been accorded with her
so the $king_arthur_s_court$ put all the trust in $ulfius$ to entreat between them so by the entreaty at the last the $king_arthur_s_court$ and she met together
now will we do well said $ulfius$ our $king_arthur_s_court$ is a lusty $black_knight$ and wifeless and my $lady_igraine$ is a passing fair #lady# it were great joy unto us all an it might please the $king_arthur_s_court$ to make her his #queen#
and anon like a lusty $black_knight$ he assented thereto with good will and so in all haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and joy
and $king_arthur_s_court$ lot of lothian and of $king_lot_of_orkney$ then wedded margawse that was $sir_gawaine$ #mother# and $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres of the #land# of garlot wedded elaine
unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the $king_arthur_s_court$ all this was done at the request of $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$
and the third sister $queen_morgan_le_fay$ was put to school in a nunnery and there she learned so much that she was a great clerk of necromancy
and after she was wedded to $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens of the #land# of gore that was sir ewain le blanchemain father chapter iii
#queen# $lady_igraine$ waxed daily greater and greater so it befell after within half a year as $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ lay by his #queen# he asked her by the faith she owed to him whose was the body then she sore abashed to give #answer#
dismay you not said the $king_arthur_s_court$ but tell me the truth and i shall love you the better by the faith of my body
the same night that my lord was dead the hour of his death as his #knight# record there came into my castle of tintagil a man like my lord in speech and in #countenance# and two #knight# with him in likeness of his two #knight# $brastias$ and jordanus and so i went unto #bed# with him as i ought to do with my lord and the same night as i shall #answer# unto god this child was begotten upon me
that is truth said the $king_arthur_s_court$ as #ye# say for it was i myself that came in the likeness and therefore dismay you not for i am father of the child and there he told her all the #cause# how it was by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ counsel
of the #birth# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and of his nurture then sir said she i shall tell you the truth then the #queen# made great joy when she knew who was the father of her child
soon came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and said sir #ye# must purvey you for the nourishing of your child as thou wilt said the $king_arthur_s_court$ be it
well said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i know a lord of yours in this #land# that is a passing true man and a faithful and he shall have the nourishing of your child and his name is sir $ector_de_maris$ and he is a lord of fair livelihood in many parts in england and wales and this lord sir $ector_de_maris$ let him be sent for for to come and speak with you and desire him yourself as he loveth you that he will put his own child to nourishing to another woman and that his #wife# nourish yours
and when the child is born let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern unchristened so like as $merlin_gat_excalibur$ devised it was done
and when sir $ector_de_maris$ was come he made fiaunce to the $king_arthur_s_court$ for to nourish the child like as the $king_arthur_s_court$ desired and there the $king_arthur_s_court$ granted sir $ector_de_maris$ great rewards
then when the #lady# was delivered the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded two #knight# and two #lady# to take the child bound in a #cloth# of gold and that #ye# deliver him to what poor man #ye# meet at the postern gate of the castle
so the child was delivered unto $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and so he bare it forth unto sir $ector_de_maris$ and made an holy man to christen him and named him $king_arthur_s_court$ and so sir $ector_de_maris$ #wife# nourished him with her own pap
chapter iv of the death of $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ then within two years $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ fell sick of a great malady
and in the meanwhile his #enemy# usurped upon him and did a great battle upon his men and slew many of his people
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ #ye# may not lie so as #ye# do for #ye# must to the field though #ye# ride on an horse litter for #ye# shall never have the better of your #enemy# but if your person be there and then shall #ye# have the victory
so it was done as $merlin_gat_excalibur$ had devised and they carried the $king_arthur_s_court$ forth in an horse litter with a great host towards his #enemy#
and that #day# sir $ulfius$ and sir $brastias$ did great deeds of #arm# and $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ men overcame the northern battle and slew many people and put the remnant to flight
and at st albans there met with the $king_arthur_s_court$ a great host of the north and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ returned unto london and made great joy of his victory
and then he fell passing sore sick so that three #day# and three nights he was speechless wherefore all the barons made great #sorrow# and asked $merlin_gat_excalibur$ what counsel were best
there is #none# other remedy said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ but god will have his will but look #ye# all barons be before $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ to morn and god and i shall make him to speak
so on the morn all the barons with $merlin_gat_excalibur$ came to #fore# the $king_arthur_s_court$ then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said aloud unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ sir shall your son $king_arthur_s_court$ be $king_arthur_s_court$ after your #day# of this realm with all the appurtenance
then $uther_pendragon$ turned him and said in hearing of them all i give him god blessing and mine and bid him pray for my #soul# and righteously and worshipfully that he claim the crown upon forfeiture of my blessing and therewith he yielded up the ghost and then was he interred as longed to a $king_arthur_s_court$
how $king_arthur_s_court$ was chosen $king_arthur_s_court$ and of #wonder# and #marvel# of a sword taken out of a stone by the said $king_arthur_s_court$
then stood the realm in great jeopardy long while for every lord that was mighty of men made him strong and many weened to have been $king_arthur_s_court$
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ went to the archbishop of canterbury and counselled him for to send for all the lords of the realm and all the #gentleman# of #arm# that they should to london come by christmas upon pain of cursing and for this #cause# that jesus that was born on that night that he would of his great mercy show some miracle as he was come to be $king_arthur_s_court$ of mankind for to show some miracle who should be rightwise $king_arthur_s_court$ of this realm
so the archbishop by the advice of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ sent for all the lords and #gentleman# of #arm# that they should come by christmas even unto london
wherefore the #queen# fair $lady_igraine$ made great #sorrow# and all the barons chapter and many of them made them clean of their life that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto god
so in the greatest church of london whether it were paul or not the french book maketh no mention all the estates were long or #day# in the church for to pray
and when matins and the first mass was done there was seen in the churchyard against the high altar a great stone four square like unto a marble stone and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point and letters there were written in gold about the sword that said thus whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise $king_arthur_s_court$ born of all england
i command said the archbishop that #ye# keep you within your church and pray unto god still that no man touch the sword till the high mass be all done
then the people marvelled and told it to the archbishop so when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the stone and the sword
and when they saw the scripture some assayed such as would have been $king_arthur_s_court$ but #none# might stir the sword nor move it
but this is my counsel said the archbishop that we let purvey ten #knight# men of good fame and they to keep this sword
so it was ordained and then there was made a cry that every man should assay that would for to win the sword
and upon new year #day# the barons let make a jousts and a #tournament# that all #knight# that would joust or tourney there might play and all this was ordained for to keep the lords together and the commons for the archbishop trusted that god would make him known that should win the sword
so upon new year #day# when the service was done the barons rode unto the field some to joust and some to tourney and so it happened that sir $ector_de_maris$ that had great livelihood about london rode unto the jousts and with him rode sir $kay_the_seneschal$ his son and young $king_arthur_s_court$ that was his nourished brother and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ was made $black_knight$ at all hallowmass afore
so as they rode to the jousts ward sir $kay_the_seneschal$ lost his sword for he had left it at his father lodging and so he prayed young $king_arthur_s_court$ for to ride for his sword
i will well said $king_arthur_s_court$ and rode fast after the sword and when he came home the #lady# and all were out to see the jousting
then was $king_arthur_s_court$ wroth and said to himself i will ride to the churchyard and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone for my brother sir $kay_the_seneschal$ shall not be without a sword this #day#
so when he came to the churchyard sir $king_arthur_s_court$ alighted and tied his horse to the stile and so he went to the tent and found no #knight# there for they were at the jousting
and so he handled the sword by the handles and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone and took his horse and rode his #way# until he came to his brother sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and delivered him the sword
and as soon as sir $kay_the_seneschal$ saw the sword he wist well it was the sword of the stone and so he rode to his father sir $ector_de_maris$ and said sir lo here is the sword of the stone wherefore i must be $king_arthur_s_court$ of this #land#
when sir $ector_de_maris$ beheld the sword he returned again and came to the church and there they alighted all three and went into the church
he is not here said the archbishop that shall achieve the sword but doubt not god will make him known and anon he made sir $kay_the_seneschal$ swear upon a book how he came to that sword
sir said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ by my brother $king_arthur_s_court$ for he brought it to me how gat #ye# this sword said sir $ector_de_maris$ to $king_arthur_s_court$
when i came home for my brother sword i found nobody at home to deliver me his sword and so i thought my brother sir $kay_the_seneschal$ should not be swordless
sir i will tell you and so i came hither eagerly and pulled it out of the stone without any pain
found #ye# any #knight# about this sword said sir $ector_de_maris$ nay said $king_arthur_s_court$ now said sir $ector_de_maris$ to $king_arthur_s_court$ i understand #ye# must be $king_arthur_s_court$ of this #land#
wherefore i said $king_arthur_s_court$ and for what #cause# sir said $ector_de_maris$ for god will have it so for there should never man have drawn out this sword but
he that shall be rightwise $king_arthur_s_court$ of this #land# now let me see whether #ye# can put the sword there as it was and pull it out again
that is no mastery said $king_arthur_s_court$ and so he put it in the stone wherewithal sir $ector_de_maris$ assayed to pull out the sword and failed
chapter vi how $king_arthur_s_court$ pulled out the sword #diver# times now assay said sir $ector_de_maris$ unto sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and anon he pulled at the sword with all his might but it would not be
now shall #ye# assay said sir $ector_de_maris$ to $king_arthur_s_court$ i will well said $king_arthur_s_court$ and pulled it out easily and therewithal sir $ector_de_maris$ knelt down to the earth and sir $kay_the_seneschal$
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ my own dear father and brother why kneel #ye# to me nay nay my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ it is not so
i was never your father nor of your blood but i wot well #ye# are of an higher blood than i weened #ye#
and then sir $ector_de_maris$ told him all how he was betaken him for to nourish him and by whose commandment and by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ deliverance
were then $king_arthur_s_court$ made great dole when he understood that sir $ector_de_maris$ was not his father sir said $ector_de_maris$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ will #ye# be my good and gracious lord when #ye# are $king_arthur_s_court$
else were i to blame said $king_arthur_s_court$ for #ye# are the man in the world that i am most beholden to and my good #lady# and #mother# your #wife# that as well as her own hath fostered me and kept
and if ever it be god will that i be $king_arthur_s_court$ as #ye# say #ye# shall desire of me what i may do and i shall not fail you god forbid i should fail you sir said sir $ector_de_maris$ i will ask no more of you but that #ye# will make my son your foster brother sir $kay_the_seneschal$ of all your #land#
that shall be done said $king_arthur_s_court$ and more by the faith of my body that never man shall have that office
but he while he and i live therewithal they went unto the archbishop and told him how the sword was achieved and by whom and on twelfth #day# all the barons came thither and to assay to take the sword who that would assay
$king_arthur_s_court$ wherefore there were many lords wroth and said it was great shame unto them all and the realm to be overgoverned with a #boy# of no high blood born
and so they fell out at that time that it was put off till candlemas and then all the barons should meet there again
but always the ten #knight# were ordained to watch the sword #day# and night and so they set a #pavilion# over the stone and the sword and five always watched
but there afore them all there might #none# take it out but so at candlemas many more great lords came thither for to have won the sword but there might #none# prevail
and right as $king_arthur_s_court$ did at christmas he did at candlemas and pulled out the sword easily whereof the barons were sore aggrieved and put it off in delay till the high feast of easter
and as $king_arthur_s_court$ sped before so did he at easter yet there were some of the great lords had indignation that $king_arthur_s_court$ should be $king_arthur_s_court$ and put it off in a delay till the feast of pentecost
then the archbishop of canterbury by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ providence let purvey then of the best #knight# that they might get and such #knight# as $uther_pendragon$ loved best and most trusted in his #day#
and such #knight# were put about $king_arthur_s_court$ as sir baudwin of britain sir $kay_the_seneschal$ sir $ulfius$ sir $brastias$ all these with many other were always about $king_arthur_s_court$ #day# and night till the feast of pentecost
and at the feast of pentecost all manner of men assayed to pull at the sword that would assay but #none# might prevail but $king_arthur_s_court$ and pulled it out afore all the lords and commons that were there wherefore all the commons cried at once we will have $king_arthur_s_court$ unto our $king_arthur_s_court$
we will put him no more in delay for we all see that it is god will that he shall be our $king_arthur_s_court$ and who that holdeth against it we will slay him
and therewithal they kneeled at once both rich and poor and cried $king_arthur_s_court$ mercy because they had delayed him so long and $king_arthur_s_court$ forgave them and took the sword between both his hands and offered it upon the altar where the archbishop was and so was he made $black_knight$ of the best man that was there
and there was he sworn unto his lords and the commons for to be a true $king_arthur_s_court$ to stand with true justice from thenceforth the #day# of this life
also then he made all lords that held of the crown to come in and to do service as they ought to do
and many #complaint# were made unto sir $king_arthur_s_court$ of great wrongs that were done since the death of $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ of many #land# that were bereaved lords #knight# #lady# and #gentleman#
chapter vii how $king_arthur_s_court$ was crowned and how he made officers and so anon was the coronation made wherefore $king_arthur_s_court$ made the #land# to be given again unto them that owned them
when this was done that the $king_arthur_s_court$ had stablished all the countries about london then he let make sir $kay_the_seneschal$ of england and sir baudwin of britain was made constable and sir $ulfius$ was made chamberlain and sir $brastias$ was made warden to wait upon the north from trent forwards for it was that time the most party the $king_arthur_s_court$ #enemy#
also wales a part of it held against $king_arthur_s_court$ but he overcame them all as he did the remnant through the noble prowess of himself and his #knight# of the round table
how $king_arthur_s_court$ held in wales at a pentecost a great feast and what #king# and lords came to his feast
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ removed into wales and let cry a great feast that it should be holden at pentecost after the incoronation of him at the city of carlion
but within few years after $king_arthur_s_court$ won all the north scotland and all that were under their obeissance chapter viii unto the feast came $king_arthur_s_court$ lot of lothian and of $king_lot_of_orkney$ with five hundred #knight# with him
also there came to the feast $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens of gore with four hundred #knight# with him also there came to that feast $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres of garlot with seven hundred #knight# with him
also there came to the feast the $king_arthur_s_court$ of scotland with six hundred #knight# with him and he was but a young man
also there came to the feast a $king_arthur_s_court$ that was called the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# but he and his men were passing well beseen at all points
and $king_arthur_s_court$ was glad of their coming for he weened that all the #king# and #knight# had come for great love and to have done him worship at his feast wherefore the $king_arthur_s_court$ made great joy and sent the #king# and #knight# great presents
but the #king# would #none# receive but rebuked the #messenger# shamefully and said they had no joy to receive no gifts of a beardless #boy# that was come of low blood and sent him word they would #none# of his gifts but that they were come to give him gifts with hard swords betwixt the #neck# and the shoulders and therefore they came thither
so they told to the #messenger# plainly for it was great shame to all them to see such a #boy# to have a rule of so noble a realm as this #land# was
also there came the $king_arthur_s_court$ of $king_carados$ with five hundred #knight# with this #answer# the #messenger# departed and told to $king_arthur_s_court$ this #answer#
wherefore by the advice of his barons he took him to a strong tower with five hundred good men with him
and all the #king# aforesaid in a manner laid a #siege# to #fore# him but $king_arthur_s_court$ was well victualed and within fifteen #day# there came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ among them into the city of carlion
then all the #king# were passing glad of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and asked him for what #cause# is that #boy# $king_arthur_s_court$ made your $king_arthur_s_court$
sirs said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i shall tell you the #cause# for he is $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ son born in wedlock gotten on $lady_igraine$ the duke #wife# of tintagil
nay said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ after the death of the duke more than three hours was $king_arthur_s_court$ begotten and thirteen #day# after $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ wedded $lady_igraine$ and therefore i prove him he is no bastard
and who saith nay he shall be $king_arthur_s_court$ and overcome all his #enemy# and or he die he shall be long $king_arthur_s_court$ of all england and have under his obeissance wales ireland and scotland and more realms than i will now rehearse
some of the #king# had #marvel# of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ words and deemed well that it should be as he said and some of them laughed him to scorn as $king_arthur_s_court$ lot and more other called him a witch
but then were they accorded with $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that $king_arthur_s_court$ should come out and speak with the #king# and to come safe and to go safe such surance there was made
so $merlin_gat_excalibur$ went unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and told him how he had done and bade him fear not but come out boldly and speak with them and spare them not but #answer# them as their $king_arthur_s_court$ and chieftain for #ye# shall overcome them all whether they will or nill
then is he a bastard they said all chapter ix of the first #war# that $king_arthur_s_court$ had and how he won the field
then $king_arthur_s_court$ came out of his tower and had under his gown a jesseraunt of double mail and there went with him the archbishop of canterbury and sir baudwin of britain and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $brastias$ these were the men of most worship that were with him
and when they were met there was no meekness but stout words on both sides but always $king_arthur_s_court$ answered them and said he would make them to bow an he lived
wherefore they departed with wrath and $king_arthur_s_court$ bade keep them well and they bade the $king_arthur_s_court$ keep him well so the $king_arthur_s_court$ returned him to the tower again and armed him and all his #knight#
what will #ye# do said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ to the #king# #ye# were better for to stint for #ye# shall not here prevail though #ye# were ten times so many
with that $merlin_gat_excalibur$ vanished away and came to $king_arthur_s_court$ and bade him set on them fiercely and in the meanwhile there were three hundred good men of the best that were with the #king# that went straight unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and that comforted him greatly
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ to $king_arthur_s_court$ fight not with the sword that #ye# had by miracle till that #ye# see #ye# go unto the worse then draw it out and do your best
be we well advised to be afeared of a #dream# reader said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot so forthwithal $king_arthur_s_court$ set upon them in their lodging
and sir baudwin sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $brastias$ slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was #marvel# and always $king_arthur_s_court$ on horseback laid on with a sword and did marvellous deeds of #arm# that many of the #king# had great joy of his deeds and hardiness
then $king_arthur_s_court$ lot #brake# out on the back side and the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and set on $king_arthur_s_court$ fiercely behind him
with that sir $king_arthur_s_court$ turned with his #knight# and smote behind and before and ever sir $king_arthur_s_court$ was in the foremost press till his horse was slain underneath him
then he drew his sword $merlin_gat_excalibur$ but it was so bright in his #enemy# eyes that it gave light like thirty torches
and therewith $king_arthur_s_court$ lot smote down $king_arthur_s_court$ with that his four #knight# received him and set him on horseback and therewith he put them a back and slew much people
and then the commons of carlion arose with clubs and staves and slew many #knight# but all the #king# held them together with their #knight# that were left alive and so fled and departed
how $merlin_gat_excalibur$ counselled $king_arthur_s_court$ to send for $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ and of their counsel taken for the #war#
so after the feast and journey $king_arthur_s_court$ drew him unto london and so by the counsel of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ let call his barons to council for $merlin_gat_excalibur$ had told the $king_arthur_s_court$ that the six #king# that made #war# upon him would in all haste be awroke on him and on his #land#
and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ came unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and counselled him to follow them no further chapter wherefore the $king_arthur_s_court$ asked counsel at them all
#ye# say well said $king_arthur_s_court$ i thank you for your good courage but will #ye# all that loveth me speak with $merlin_gat_excalibur$
#ye# know well that he hath done much for me and he knoweth many #thing# and when he is afore you i would that #ye# prayed him heartily of his best advice
they could no counsel give but said they were big enough all the barons said they would pray him and desire him
i shall say you said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i warn you all your #enemy# are passing strong for you and they are good men of #arm# as be alive and by this time they have gotten to them four #king# more and a mighty duke and unless that our $king_arthur_s_court$ have more chivalry with him than he may make within the bounds of his own realm an he fight with them in battle he shall be overcome and slain
so $merlin_gat_excalibur$ was sent for and fair desired of all the barons to give them best counsel what were best to do in this #cause# said all the barons
i shall tell you said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ mine advice there are two brethren beyond the sea and they be #king# both and marvellous good men of their hands and that one hight $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ of benwick and that other hight $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ of gaul that is france
and on these two #king# warreth a mighty man of men the $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ and striveth with them for a castle and great #war#
he getteth good #knight# that he putteth these two #king# most part to the worse wherefore this is my counsel that our $king_arthur_s_court$ and sovereign lord send unto the #king# $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ by two trusty #knight# with letters
well devised that an they will come and see $king_arthur_s_court$ and his #court# and so #help# him in his #war# that he will be sworn unto them to #help# them in their #war# against $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$
is betwixt them but this $king_claudas$ is so mighty of goods whereof now what say #ye# unto this counsel said $merlin_gat_excalibur$
this is well counselled said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the barons right so in all haste there were ordained to go two #knight# on the message unto the two #king#
$ulfius$ and $brastias$ were made the #messenger# and so rode forth well horsed and well armed and as the guise was that time and so passed the sea and rode toward the city of benwick
and there besides were eight #knight# that espied them and at a strait passage they met with $ulfius$ and $brastias$ and would have taken them #prisoner# so they prayed them that they might pass for they were #messenger# unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ sent from $king_arthur_s_court$
so were there made letters in the pleasant wise according unto $king_arthur_s_court$ desire therefore said the eight #knight# #ye# shall die or be #prisoner# for we be #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$
and therewith two of them dressed their spears and $ulfius$ and $brastias$ dressed their spears and ran together with great raundom
and $king_claudas$ #knight# #brake# their spears and theirs to held and bare the two #knight# out of their saddles to the earth and so left them lying and rode their #way#
and the other six #knight# rode afore to a passage to meet with them again and so $ulfius$ and $brastias$ smote other two down and so passed on their #way#
and at the fourth passage there met two for two and both were laid unto the earth so there was #none# of the eight #knight#
but he was sore #hurt# or bruised and when they come to benwick it fortuned there were both #king# $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$
and when it was told the #king# that there were come #messenger# there were sent unto them two #knight# of worship the one hight lionses lord of the country of payarne and sir phariance a worshipful $black_knight$
anon they asked from whence they came and they said from $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_arthur_s_court$ of england so they took them in their #arm# and made great joy each of other
they were #messenger# of $king_arthur_s_court$ there was made no tarrying but forthwith they spake with the #knight# and welcomed them in the faithfullest wise and said they were most welcome unto them before all the #king# living and therewith they kissed the letters and delivered them
but anon as the two #king# wist and when $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ understood the letters then they were more welcome than they were before
and after the haste of the letters they gave them this #answer# that they would fulfil the desire of $king_arthur_s_court$ writing and $ulfius$ and $brastias$ tarry there as long as they would they should have such #cheer# as might be made them in those marches
then $ulfius$ and $brastias$ told the #king# of the adventure at their passages of the eight #knight# ha ah said $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ they were my good friends
so $ulfius$ and $brastias$ had good #cheer# and great gifts as much as they might bear away and had their #answer# by mouth and by writing that those two #king# would come unto $king_arthur_s_court$ in all the haste that they might
so the two #knight# rode on afore and passed the sea and came to their lord and told him how they had sped whereof $king_arthur_s_court$ was passing glad
i would i had wist of them they should not have escaped so at what time suppose #ye# the two #king# will be here
sir said they afore all hallowmass then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let purvey for a great feast and let cry a great jousts
and by all hallowmass the two #king# were come over the sea with three hundred #knight# well arrayed both for the #peace# and for the #war#
and $king_arthur_s_court$ met with them ten mile out of london and there was great joy as could be thought or made
and on all hallowmass at the great feast sat in the hall the three #king# and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ served in the hall and sir $lucas$ the butler that was duke corneus son and sir $griflet$ that was the son of cardol these three #knight# had the rule of all the service that served the #king#
and anon as they had washen and risen all #knight# that would joust made them ready by then they were ready on horseback
and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ with the archbishop of canterbury and sir $ector_de_maris$ $kay_the_seneschal$ father they were in a place covered with #cloth# of gold like an hall with #lady# and gentlewomen for to behold who did best and thereon to give judgment
of a great tourney made by $king_arthur_s_court$ and the two #king# $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ and how they went over the sea
there were seven hundred #knight# chapter xi and $king_arthur_s_court$ and the two #king# let depart the seven hundred #knight# in two parties
and there were three hundred #knight# of the realm of benwick and of gaul turned on the other side then they dressed their shields and began to couch their spears many good #knight#
so $griflet$ was the first that met with a $black_knight$ one ladinas and they met so eagerly that all men had #wonder# and they so fought that their shields fell to pieces and horse and man fell to the earth and both the french $black_knight$ and the english $black_knight$ lay so long that all men weened they had been dead
when $lucas$ the butler saw $griflet$ so lie he horsed him again anon and they two did marvellous deeds of #arm# with many bachelors
but sir $kay_the_seneschal$ did that #day# marvellous deeds of #arm# that there was #none# did so well as he that #day#
also sir $kay_the_seneschal$ came out of an ambushment with five #knight# with him and they six smote other six down then there came ladinas and gracian two #knight# of france and did passing well that all men praised them
then came there sir placidas a good $black_knight$ and met with sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and smote him down horse and man where #fore# sir $griflet$ was wroth and met with sir placidas so hard that horse and man fell to the earth
but when the five #knight# wist that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ had a fall they were wroth out of #wit# and therewith each of them five bare down a $black_knight$
when $king_arthur_s_court$ and the two #king# saw them begin to wax wroth on both parties they leapt on small hackneys and let cry that all men should depart unto their lodging
and after the three #king# went into a garden and gave the #prize# unto sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and to $lucas$ the butler and unto sir $griflet$
and then they went unto council and with them gwenbaus the brother unto sir $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ a wise clerk and thither went $ulfius$ and $brastias$ and $merlin_gat_excalibur$
and so they went home and unarmed them and so to evensong and supper and after they had been in council they went unto #bed#
and on the morn they heard mass and to dinner and so to their council and made many arguments what were best to do
at the last they were concluded that $merlin_gat_excalibur$ should go with a token of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and that was a ring unto his men and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ and gracian and placidas should go again and keep their castles and their countries as for dread of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ of benwick and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ of gaul had ordained them and so passed the sea and came to benwick
and when the people saw $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ ring and gracian and placidas they were glad and asked how the #king# fared and made great joy of their welfare and cording and according unto the sovereign lords desire the men of #war# made them ready in all haste possible so that they were fifteen thousand on horse and foot and they had great plenty of victual with them by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ provision
but gracian and placidas were left to furnish and garnish the castles for dread of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ right so $merlin_gat_excalibur$ passed the sea well victualled both by water and by #land#
and when he came to the sea he sent home the footmen again and took no more with him but ten thousand men on horseback the most part men of #arm# and so shipped and passed the sea into england and landed at dover and through the #wit# of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ he had the host northward the priviest #way# that could be thought unto the forest of bedegraine and there in a #valley# he lodged them secretly
then rode $merlin_gat_excalibur$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and the two #king# and told them how he had sped whereof they had great #marvel# that man on earth might speed so soon and go and come
so $merlin_gat_excalibur$ told them ten thousand were in the forest of bedegraine well armed at all points then was there no more to say but to horseback went all the host as $king_arthur_s_court$ had afore purveyed
so with twenty thousand he passed by night and #day# but there was made such an ordinance afore by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that there should no man of #war# ride nor go in no country on this side trent water but if he had a token from $king_arthur_s_court$ where through the $king_arthur_s_court$ #enemy# durst not ride as they did to #fore# to espy
and so within a little space the three #king# came unto the castle of bedegraine and found there a passing fair fellowship and well beseen whereof
chapter xii how eleven #king# gathered a great host against $king_arthur_s_court$ they had great joy and victual they wanted #none#
this was the #cause# of the northern host that they were reared for the despite and #rebuke# the six #king# had at carlion
and those six #king# by their #mean# gat unto them five other #king# and thus they began to gather their people
and now they sware that for weal nor woe they should not leave other till they had destroyed $king_arthur_s_court$ and then they made an #oath#
the first that began the #oath# was the duke of cambenet that he would bring with him five thousand men of #arm# the which were ready on horseback
then sware $king_arthur_s_court$ brandegoris of stranggore that he would bring five thousand men of #arm# on horseback then sware $king_arthur_s_court$ clariance of northumberland he would bring three thousand men of #arm#
then sware the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# that was a passing good man and a young that he would bring four thousand men of #arm# on horseback
then there swore $king_arthur_s_court$ lot a passing good $black_knight$ and sir gawain father that he would bring five thousand men of #arm# on horseback
also there swore $king_arthur_s_court$ urience that was sir uwain father of the #land# of gore and he would bring six thousand men of #arm# on horseback
also there swore $king_arthur_s_court$ idres of cornwall that he would bring five thousand men of #arm# on horseback also there swore $king_arthur_s_court$ cradelmas to bring five thousand men on horseback
also there swore $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance of ireland to bring five thousand men of #arm# on horseback also there swore $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres to bring five thousand men of #arm# on horseback
so their whole host was of clean men of #arm# on horseback fifty thousand and a foot ten thousand of good men bodies
then were they soon ready and mounted upon horse and sent forth their #fore# riders for these eleven #king# in their #way# laid a #siege# unto the castle of bedegraine and so they departed and drew toward $king_arthur_s_court$ and left few to abide at the #siege# for the castle of bedegraine was holden of $king_arthur_s_court$ and the men that were therein were $king_arthur_s_court$
also there swore $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ to bring five thousand men of #arm# on horseback chapter xiii of a #dream# of the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight#
so by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ advice there were sent #fore# riders to skim the country and they met with the #fore# riders of the north and made them to tell which #way# the host came and then they told it to $king_arthur_s_court$ and by $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ council they let burn and destroy all the country afore them there they should ride
the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# met a #wonder# #dream# two nights afore the battle that there blew a great wind and blew down their castles and their towns and after that came a water and bare it all away
then by counsel of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ when they wist which #way# the eleven #king# would ride and lodge that night at midnight they set upon them as they were in their #pavilion#
all that heard of the sweven said it was a token of great battle but the scout watch by their host cried lords at #arm#
for here be your #enemy# at your hand chapter xiv how the eleven #king# with their host fought against $king_arthur_s_court$ and his host and many great #feat# of the #war#
then $king_arthur_s_court$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ with their good and trusty #knight# set on them so fiercely that they made them overthrow their #pavilion# on their #head# but the eleven #king# by manly prowess of #arm# took a fair champaign but there was slain that morrowtide ten thousand good men bodies
and so they had afore them a strong passage yet were they fifty thousand of hardy men then it drew toward #day#
i would that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ with their fellowship of ten thousand men were put in a #wood# here beside in an ambushment and keep them privy and that they be laid or the light of the #day# come and that they stir not till #ye# and your #knight# have fought with them long
and when it is daylight dress your battle even afore them and the passage that they may see all your host for then will they be the more hardy when they see you but about twenty thousand men and #cause# them to be the gladder to suffer you and your host to come over the passage
all the three #king# and the whole barons said that $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said passingly well and it was done anon as $merlin_gat_excalibur$ had devised
now shall #ye# do by mine advice said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ unto the three #king# so on the morn when either host saw other the host of the north was well comforted
then to $ulfius$ and $brastias$ were delivered three thousand men of #arm# and they set on them fiercely in the passage and slew on the right hand and on the left hand that it was #wonder# to tell
when that the eleven #king# saw that there was so few a fellowship did such deeds of #arm# they were ashamed and set on them again fiercely and there was sir $ulfius$ horse slain under him but he did marvellously well on foot
then $brastias$ saw his fellow fared so withal he smote the duke with a spear that horse and man fell down
that saw $king_arthur_s_court$ clariance and returned unto $brastias$ and either smote other so that horse and man went to the earth and so they lay long astonied and their horses knees brast to the hard bone
but the duke eustace of cambenet and $king_arthur_s_court$ clariance of northumberland were alway grievous on $ulfius$ then came sir $kay_the_seneschal$ with six fellows with him and did passing well
with that came the eleven #king# and there was $griflet$ put to the earth horse and man and $lucas$ the butler horse and man by $king_arthur_s_court$ brandegoris and $king_arthur_s_court$ idres and $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance
when sir $kay_the_seneschal$ saw $griflet$ on foot he rode on $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres and smote him down and led his horse unto sir $griflet$ and horsed him again
then waxed the medley passing hard on both parties also sir $kay_the_seneschal$ with the same spear smote down $king_arthur_s_court$ lot and #hurt# him passing sore
that saw the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and ran unto sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and smote him down and took his horse and gave him $king_arthur_s_court$ lot whereof he said gramercy
when sir $griflet$ saw sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and $lucas$ the butler on foot he took a sharp spear great and square and rode to pinel a good man of #arm# and smote horse and man down and then he took his horse and gave him unto sir $kay_the_seneschal$
then $king_arthur_s_court$ lot saw $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres on foot he ran unto melot de la roche and smote him down horse and man and gave $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres the horse and horsed him again
also the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# saw $king_arthur_s_court$ idres on foot then he ran unto gwiniart de bloi and smote him down horse and man and gave $king_arthur_s_court$ idres the horse and horsed him again and $king_arthur_s_court$ lot smote down clariance de la forest $balin_le_savage$ and gave the horse unto duke eustace
and so when they had horsed the #king# again they drew them all eleven #king# together and said they would be revenged of the damage that they had taken that #day#
the meanwhile came in sir $ector_de_maris$ with an eager #countenance# and found $ulfius$ and $brastias$ on foot in great peril of death that were foul defoiled under horse feet
then $king_arthur_s_court$ as a lion ran unto $king_arthur_s_court$ cradelment of north wales and smote him through the left side that the horse and the $king_arthur_s_court$ fell down and then he took the horse by the rein and led him unto $ulfius$ and said have this horse mine old friend for great need hast thou of horse
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# saw $king_arthur_s_court$ cradelment on foot he ran unto sir $ector_de_maris$ that was well horsed sir $kay_the_seneschal$ father and smote horse and man down and gave the horse unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and horsed him again
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ saw the $king_arthur_s_court$ ride on sir $ector_de_maris$ horse he was wroth and with his sword he smote the $king_arthur_s_court$ on the #helm# that a quarter of the #helm# and shield fell down and so the sword carved down unto the horse #neck# and so the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the horse fell down to the ground
then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ came unto sir morganore $kay_the_seneschal$ with the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# and smote him down horse and man and led the horse unto his father sir $ector_de_maris$ then sir $ector_de_maris$ ran unto a $black_knight$ hight lardans and smote horse and man down and led the horse unto sir $brastias$ that great need had of an horse and was greatly defoiled
when $brastias$ beheld $lucas$ the butler that lay like a dead man under the horses feet and ever sir $griflet$ did marvellously for to rescue him and there were always fourteen #knight# on sir $lucas$ then $brastias$ smote one of them on the #helm# that it went to the teeth and he rode to another and smote him that the #arm# flew into the field
gramercy said $ulfius$ then sir $king_arthur_s_court$ did so marvellously in #arm# that all men had #wonder# then he went to the third and smote him on the shoulder that shoulder and #arm# flew in the field
and when $griflet$ saw rescues he smote a $black_knight$ on the temples that #head# and #helm# went to the earth and $griflet$ took the horse of that $black_knight$ and led him unto sir $lucas$ and bade him mount upon the horse and revenge his #hurt#
then $lucas$ saw $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance that late had slain moris de la roche and $lucas$ ran to him with a short spear that was great that he gave him such a fall that the horse fell down to the earth
also $lucas$ found there on foot bloias de la flandres and sir gwinas two hardy #knight# and in that woodness that $lucas$ was in he slew two bachelors and horsed them again
then waxed the battle passing hard on both parties but $king_arthur_s_court$ was glad that his #knight# were horsed again and then they fought together that the noise and sound rang by the water and the #wood#
wherefore $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ made them ready and dressed their shields and harness and they were so courageous that many #knight# shook and bevered for eagerness
all this while $lucas$ and gwinas and briant and bellias of flanders held strong medley against six #king# that was $king_arthur_s_court$ lot $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres $king_arthur_s_court$ brandegoris $king_arthur_s_court$ idres $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens and $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance
so with the #help# of sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and of sir $griflet$ they held these six #king# hard that unnethe they had any power to defend them
but when sir $king_arthur_s_court$ saw the battle would not be ended by no manner he fared #wood# as a lion and steered his horse here and there on the right hand and on the left hand that he stinted not till he had slain twenty #knight#
also he wounded $king_arthur_s_court$ lot sore on the shoulder and made him to leave that ground for sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and $griflet$ did with $king_arthur_s_court$ there great deeds of #arm#
then $ulfius$ and $brastias$ and sir $ector_de_maris$ encountered against the duke eustace and $king_arthur_s_court$ cradelment and $king_arthur_s_court$ clariance of northumberland and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and against the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight#
for $brastias$ had slain a $black_knight$ to #fore# and horsed $griflet$ chapter xv yet of the same battle so these #knight# encountered with these #king# that they made them to avoid the ground
then $king_arthur_s_court$ lot made great dole for his damages and his fellows and said unto the ten #king# but if #ye# will do as i devise we shall be slain and destroyed let me have the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance and $king_arthur_s_court$ idres and the duke of cambenet and we five #king# will have fifteen thousand men of #arm# with us and we will go apart while #ye# six #king# hold medley with twelve thousand an we see that #ye# have foughten with them long then will we come on fiercely and else shall we never match them said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot but by this #mean#
so they departed as they here devised and six #king# made their party strong against $king_arthur_s_court$ and made great #war# long
in the meanwhile #brake# the ambushment of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ and lionses and phariance had the vanguard and they two #knight# met with $king_arthur_s_court$ idres and his fellowship and there began a great medley of breaking of spears and smiting of swords with slaying of men and horses and $king_arthur_s_court$ idres was near at discomforture
that saw agwisance the $king_arthur_s_court$ and put lionses and phariance in point of death for the duke of cambenet came on withal with a great fellowship
so these two #knight# were in great danger of their lives that they were fain to return but always they rescued themselves and their fellowship marvellously
when $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ saw those #knight# put aback it grieved him sore then he came on so fast that his fellowship seemed as black as inde
when $king_arthur_s_court$ lot had espied $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ he knew him well then he said $o_jesu$ defend us from death and horrible maims
for i see yonder a $king_arthur_s_court$ one of the most worshipfullest men and one of the best #knight# of the world is inclined unto his fellowship
for i see well we be in great peril of death what is he said the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight#
it is said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ of gaul i #marvel# how they came into this country without witting of us all
it was by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ advice said the $black_knight$ as for him said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ i will encounter with $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ an #ye# will rescue me when myster is
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and his host rode on a soft pace till that they came as #nigh# $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ as bow draught then either battle let their horse run as fast as they might
go on said they all we will do all that we may and $bleoberis_de_ganis$ that was godson unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ he bare his chief standard
now shall we see said $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ how these northern britons can bear the #arm# and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ encountered with a $black_knight$ and smote him throughout with a spear that he fell dead unto the earth and after drew his sword and did marvellous deeds of #arm# that all parties had great #wonder# thereof and his #knight# failed not but did their part and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ was smitten to the earth
with that came the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and rescued $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ mightily by #force# of #arm# for he was a passing good $black_knight$ of a $king_arthur_s_court$ and but a young man
that was a passing good $black_knight$ chapter xvi yet more of the same battle by then came into the field $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ as fierce as a lion with bands of green and thereupon gold
a said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot we must be discomfited for yonder i see the most valiant $black_knight$ of the world and the man of the most renown for such two brethren as is $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ are not living wherefore we must needs void or die and but if we avoid manly and wisely there is but death
when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ came into the battle he came in so fiercely that the #stroke# redounded again from the #wood# and the water wherefore $king_arthur_s_court$ lot wept for pity and dole that he saw so many good #knight# take their end
but through the great #force# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ they made both the northern battles that were departed hurtled together for great dread and the three #king# and their #knight# slew on ever that it was pity on to behold that multitude of the people that fled
but $king_arthur_s_court$ lot and $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# and $king_arthur_s_court$ morganore gathered the people together passing knightly and did great prowess of #arm# and held the battle all that #day# like hard
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# beheld the great damage that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ did he thrust unto him with his horse and smote him on high upon the #helm# a great #stroke# and astonied him sore
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ was wroth with him and followed on him fiercely the other saw that and cast up his shield and spurred his horse forward but the #stroke# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ fell down and carved a cantel off the shield and the sword slid down by the hauberk behind his back and cut through the trapping of steel and the horse even in two pieces that the sword felt the earth
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# voided the horse lightly and with his sword he broached the horse of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ through and through
with that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ voided lightly from the dead horse and then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ smote at the other so eagerly and smote him on the #helm# that he fell to the earth
by then came into the press $king_arthur_s_court$ and found $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ standing among dead men and dead horses fighting on foot as a #wood# lion that there came #none# #nigh# him as far as he might reach with his sword but he caught a grievous #buffet# whereof $king_arthur_s_court$ had great pity
and $king_arthur_s_court$ was so bloody that by his shield there might no man know him for all was blood and brains on his sword
and as $king_arthur_s_court$ looked by him he saw a $black_knight$ that was passingly well horsed and therewith sir $king_arthur_s_court$ ran to him and smote him on the #helm# that his sword went unto his teeth and the $black_knight$ sank down to the earth dead and anon $king_arthur_s_court$ took the horse by the rein and led him unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and said fair brother have this horse for he have great myster thereof and me repenteth sore of your great damage
it shall be soon revenged said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ for i trust in god mine ure is not such but some of them may sore repent this
ha also in that ire he felled $king_arthur_s_court$ morganore and there was great slaughter of good #knight# and much people i will well said $king_arthur_s_court$ for i see your deeds full actual
but when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ was mounted on horseback then there began new battle the which was sore and hard and passing great slaughter
nevertheless i might not come at you at that time and so through great #force# $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ made their #knight# a little to withdraw them
but alway the eleven #king# with their chivalry never turned back and so withdrew them to a little #wood# and so over a little river and there they rested them for on the night they might have no #rest# on the field
and then the eleven #king# and #knight# put them on a heap all together as men adread and out of all comfort
no man might pass them they held them so hard together both behind and before that $king_arthur_s_court$ had #marvel# of their deeds of #arm# and was passing wroth
ah sir $king_arthur_s_court$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ blame them not for they do as good men ought to do
for by my faith said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ they are the best fighting men and #knight# of most prowess that ever i saw or heard speak of and those eleven #king# are men of great worship and if they were longing unto you there were no $king_arthur_s_court$ under the heaven had such eleven #knight# and of such worship
we well said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ for they are your mortal #enemy# and that hath been proved aforehand and this #day# they have done their part and that is great pity of their wilfulness
then all the eleven #king# drew them together and then said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot lords #ye# must other #way# than #ye# do or else the great loss is behind
#ye# may see what people we have lost and what good men we lose because we wait always on these foot men and ever in saving of one of the foot men we lose ten horsemen for him therefore this is mine advice let us put our foot men from us for it is near night for the noble $king_arthur_s_court$ will not tarry on the footmen for they may save themselves the #wood# is near hand
and when we horsemen be together look every each of you #king# let make such ordinance that #none# break upon pain of death
and who that seeth any man dress him to flee lightly that he be slain for it is better that we slay a coward than through a coward all we to be slain
but there was i may not love them said $king_arthur_s_court$ they would destroy me that wot how say #ye# said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot #answer# me all #ye# #king#
it is well said quoth $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres so said the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# the same said the $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens so did $king_arthur_s_court$ idres and $king_arthur_s_court$ brandegoris and so did $king_arthur_s_court$ cradelment and the duke of cambenet
the same said $king_arthur_s_court$ clariance and $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance and sware they would never fail other neither for life nor for death
then they amended their harness and righted their shields and took new spears and set them on their thighs and stood still as it had been a plump of #wood#
and whoso that fled but did as they did should be slain chapter #xvii# yet more of the same battle and how it was ended by $merlin_gat_excalibur$
when sir $king_arthur_s_court$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ beheld them and all their #knight# they praised them much for their noble #cheer# of chivalry for the hardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw
with that there dressed them a forty noble #knight# and said unto the three #king# they would break their battle these were their names lionses phariance $ulfius$ $brastias$ $ector_de_maris$ $kay_the_seneschal$ $lucas$ the butler $griflet$ le fise de dieu mariet de la roche guinas de bloi briant de la forest $balin_le_savage$ bellaus morians of the castle of #maiden# flannedrius of the castle of #lady# annecians that was $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ godson a noble $black_knight$ ladinas de la rouse emerause caulas graciens le castlein one blois de la case and sir colgrevaunce de gorre all these #knight# rode on afore with spears on their thighs and spurred their horses mightily as the horses might run
and the eleven #king# with part of their #knight# rushed with their horses as fast as they might with their spears and there they did on both parties marvellous deeds of #arm#
so came into the thick of the press $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ and slew down right on both hands that their horses went in blood up to the fetlocks
wherefore $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ had great #marvel# considering the great slaughter that there was but at the last they were driven aback over a little river
but ever the eleven #king# and their host was ever in the visage of $king_arthur_s_court$ with that came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ on a great black horse and said unto $king_arthur_s_court$ thou hast never done
hast thou not done enough of three score thousand this #day# hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand and it is time to say ho
for god is wroth with thee that thou wilt never have done for yonder eleven #king# at this time will not be overthrown but an thou tarry on them any longer thy #fortune# will turn and they shall increase
and therefore withdraw you unto your lodging and #rest# you as soon as #ye# may and reward your good #knight# with gold and with silver for they have well deserved it there may no riches be too dear for them for of so few men as #ye# have there were never men
did more of prowess than they have done today for #ye# have matched this #day# with the best fighters of the world
that is truth said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ also said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ withdraw you where #ye# list for this three year i dare undertake they shall not dere you and by then #ye# shall hear new tidings
and then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said unto $king_arthur_s_court$ these eleven #king# have more on hand than they are #ware# of for the saracens are landed in their countries more than forty thousand that burn and slay and have laid #siege# at the castle wandesborow and make great destruction therefore dread you not this three year
also sir all the goods that be gotten at this battle let it be searched and when #ye# have it in your hands let it be given freely unto these two #king# $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ that they may reward their #knight# withal and that shall #cause# strangers to be of better will to do you service at need
also you be able to reward your own #knight# of your own goods whensomever it liketh you it is well said quoth $king_arthur_s_court$ and as thou hast devised so shall it be done
when it was delivered to $king_ban$ and $bors_de_ganis$ they gave the goods as freely to their #knight# as freely as it was given to them
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ took his leave of $king_arthur_s_court$ and of the two #king# for to go and see his #master# bleise that dwelt in northumberland and so he departed and came to his #master# that was passing glad of his coming and there he told how $king_arthur_s_court$ and the two #king# had sped at the great battle and how it was ended and told the names of every $king_arthur_s_court$ and $black_knight$ of worship that was there
and so bleise wrote the battle word by word as $merlin_gat_excalibur$ told him how it began and by whom and in likewise how it was ended and who had the worse
$merlin_gat_excalibur$ did his #master# bleise do write also he did do write all the battles that every worthy $black_knight$ did of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
after this $merlin_gat_excalibur$ departed from his #master# and came to $king_arthur_s_court$ that was in the castle of bedegraine that was one of the castles that stand in the forest of sherwood
and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ was so disguised that $king_arthur_s_court$ knew him not for he was all befurred in black sheep skins and a great pair of boots and a bow and arrows in a russet gown and brought wild geese in his hand and it was on the morn after candlemas #day# but $king_arthur_s_court$ knew him not
all the battles that were done in $king_arthur_s_court$ #day# sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ will #ye# give me a gift
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ #ye# were better to give me a gift that is not in your hand than to lose great riches for here in the same place where the great battle was is great treasure hid in the earth
wherefore said $king_arthur_s_court$ should i give thee a gift churl who told thee so churl said $king_arthur_s_court$ $merlin_gat_excalibur$ told me so said he
then $ulfius$ and $brastias$ knew him well enough and smiled sir said these two #knight# it is $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that so speaketh unto you
then $king_arthur_s_court$ was greatly abashed and had #marvel# of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and so had $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ and so they had great disport at him
so in the meanwhile there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that was an earl daughter his name was sanam and her name was lionors a passing fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ and so she came thither for to do homage as other lords did after the great battle
and $king_arthur_s_court$ set his love greatly upon her and so did she upon him and the $king_arthur_s_court$ had ado with her and gat on her a child his name was borre that was after a good $black_knight$ and of the table round
then there came word that the $king_arthur_s_court$ rience of north wales made great #war# on $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_leodegrance$ of cameliard for the which #thing#
so by ordinance of the three #king# that were sent home unto benwick all they would depart for dread of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ and phariance and antemes and gratian and lionses of payarne with the leaders of those that should keep the #king# #land#
$king_arthur_s_court$ was wroth for he loved him well and hated $king_arthur_s_court$ rience for he was alway against him chapter xviii how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ rescued $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_leodegrance$ and other incidents
and then $king_arthur_s_court$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ departed with their fellowship a twenty thousand and came within six #day# into the country of cameliard and there rescued $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_leodegrance$ and slew there much people of $king_arthur_s_court$ rience unto the number of ten thousand men and put him to flight
and then had these three #king# great #cheer# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_leodegrance$ that thanked them of their great goodness that they would revenge him of his #enemy# and there had $king_arthur_s_court$ the first sight of $dame_guenever$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter of cameliard and ever after he loved her
so briefly to make an end they took their leave to go into their own countries for $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ did great destruction on their #land#
nay said the #king# #ye# shall not at this time for #ye# have much to do yet in these #land# therefore we will depart and with the great goods that we have gotten in these #land# by your gifts we shall wage good #knight# and withstand the $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ malice for by the grace of god an we have need
we will send to you for your succour and if #ye# have need send for us and we will not tarry by the faith of our bodies
it shall not said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ need that these two #king# come again in the #way# of #war# but i know well $king_arthur_s_court$ may not be long from you for within a year or two #ye# shall have great need and then shall he revenge you on your #enemy# as #ye# have done on his
for these eleven #king# shall die all in a #day# by the great might and prowess of #arm# of two valiant #knight# as it telleth after their names be $balin_le_savage$ and $balan$ his brother that be marvellous good #knight# as be any living
now turn we to the eleven #king# that returned unto a city that hight sorhaute the which city was within $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens and there they refreshed them as well as they might and made leeches search their #wound# and sorrowed greatly for the death of their people
with that there came a #messenger# and told how there was come into their #land# people that were lawless as well as saracens a forty thousand and have burnt and slain all the people that they may come by without mercy and have laid #siege# on the castle of wandesborow
alas said the eleven #king# here is #sorrow# upon #sorrow# and if we had not warred against $king_arthur_s_court$ as we have done he would soon revenge us
as for $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_leodegrance$ he loveth $king_arthur_s_court$ better than us and as for $king_arthur_s_court$ rience he hath enough to do with $king_leodegrance$ for he hath laid #siege# unto him
after they were wedded as it telleth in the book then said $king_arthur_s_court$ i will go with you so they consented together to keep all the marches of cornwall of wales and of the north
so first they put $king_arthur_s_court$ idres in the city of nauntes in britain with four thousand men of #arm# to watch both the water and the #land#
also they put in the city of windesan $king_arthur_s_court$ nentres of garlot with four thousand #knight# to watch both on water and on #land#
also they had of other men of #war# more than eight thousand for to fortify all the fortresses in the marches of cornwall
also they put more #knight# in all the marches of wales and scotland with many good men of #arm# and so they kept them together the space of three year and ever allied them with mighty #king# and dukes and lords
and all this while they furnished them and garnished them of good men of #arm# and victual and of all manner of habiliment that pretendeth to the #war# to avenge them for the battle of bedegraine as it telleth in the book of adventures following
and to them fell $king_arthur_s_court$ rience of north wales the which and nero that was a mighty man of men chapter xix
how $king_arthur_s_court$ rode to carlion and of his #dream# and how he saw the questing beast then after the #departing# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and of $king_arthur_s_court$ $bors_de_ganis$ $king_arthur_s_court$ rode into carlion
and thither came to him $king_arthur_s_court$ lot #wife# of $king_lot_of_orkney$ in manner of a message but she was sent thither to espy the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and she came richly beseen with her four sons $sir_gawaine$ $gaheris$ agravine and $gareth_of_orkney$ with many other #knight# and #lady#
for she was a passing fair #lady# therefore the $king_arthur_s_court$ cast great love unto her and desired to lie by her so they were agreed and he begat upon her $mordred$ and she was his sister on his #mother# side $lady_igraine$
so there she rested her a month and at the last departed then the $king_arthur_s_court$ dreamed a marvellous #dream# whereof he was sore adread
thus was the #dream# of $king_arthur_s_court$ him thought there was come into this #land# griffins and serpents and him thought they burnt and slew all the people in the #land# and then him thought he fought with them and they did him passing great harm and wounded him full sore but at the last he slew them
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ awaked he was passing heavy of his #dream# and so to put it out of thoughts he made him ready with many #knight# to ride a hunting
but all this time $king_arthur_s_court$ knew not that $king_arthur_s_court$ lot #wife# was his sister as soon as he was in the forest the $king_arthur_s_court$ saw a great hart afore him
this hart will i chase said $king_arthur_s_court$ and so he spurred the horse and rode after long and so by fine #force# oft
he was like to have smitten the hart whereas the $king_arthur_s_court$ had chased the hart so long that his horse lost his breath and fell down dead
so the $king_arthur_s_court$ saw the hart enbushed and his horse dead he set him down by a #fountain# and there he fell in great thoughts
then a yeoman fetched the $king_arthur_s_court$ another horse and as he sat so him thought he heard a noise of #hound# to the sum of thirty
and with that the $king_arthur_s_court$ saw coming toward him the strangest beast that ever he saw or heard of so the beast went to the well and drank and the noise was in the beast belly like unto the questing of thirty couple #hound# but all the while the beast drank there was no noise in the beast belly and there with the beast departed with a great noise whereof the $king_arthur_s_court$ had great #marvel#
so there came a $black_knight$ afoot unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and said $black_knight$ full of thought and sleepy tell me if thou sawest a strange beast pass this #way#
and so he was in a great thought and therewith he fell asleep right such one saw i said $king_arthur_s_court$ that is past two mile what would #ye# with the beast said $king_arthur_s_court$
sir i have followed that beast long time and killed mine horse so would god i had another to follow my #quest#
right so came one with the $king_arthur_s_court$ horse and when the $black_knight$ saw the horse he prayed the $king_arthur_s_court$ to give him the horse for i have followed this #quest# this twelvemonth and either i shall achieve him or bleed of the best blood of my body
$king_pellinore$ that time $king_arthur_s_court$ followed the questing beast and after his death sir $palamides_the_saracen$ followed it chapter #xx# how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ took $king_arthur_s_court$ horse and followed the questing beast and how $merlin_gat_excalibur$ met with $king_arthur_s_court$
sir $black_knight$ said the $king_arthur_s_court$ leave that #quest# and suffer me to have it and i will follow it another twelvemonth
ah #fool# said the $black_knight$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ it is in vain thy desire for it shall never be achieved but by me or my next kin
therewith he started unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ horse and mounted into the saddle and said gramercy this horse is my own well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ thou mayst take my horse by #force# but an
i might prove thee whether thou were better on horseback or i well said the $black_knight$ seek me here when thou wilt and here #nigh# this well thou shalt find me and so passed on his #way#
right so came by him $merlin_gat_excalibur$ like a child of fourteen year of #age# and saluted the $king_arthur_s_court$ and asked him why he was so pensive
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ sat in a study and bade his men fetch his horse as fast as ever they might i may well be pensive said the $king_arthur_s_court$ for i have seen the marvellest sight that ever i saw
that know i well said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ as well as thyself and of all thy thoughts but thou art but a #fool# to take thought for it will not amend thee
also i know what thou art and who was thy father and of whom thou wert begotten $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ was thy father and begat thee on $lady_igraine$
that is false said $king_arthur_s_court$ how shouldest thou know it for thou art not so old of years to know my father
yes said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i know it better than #ye# or any man living i will not believe thee said $king_arthur_s_court$ and was wroth with the child
so departed $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and came again in the likeness of an old man of fourscore year of #age# whereof the $king_arthur_s_court$ was right glad for he seemed to be right wise
also here was a child and told me many #thing# that meseemeth he should not know for he was not of #age# to know my father
yes said the old man the child told you truth and more would he have told you an #ye# would have suffered him
but #ye# have done a #thing# late that god is displeased with you for #ye# have lain by your sister and on her #ye# have gotten a child that shall destroy you and all the #knight# of your realm
then said the old man why are #ye# so sad i may well be heavy said $king_arthur_s_court$ for many #thing# what are #ye# said $king_arthur_s_court$ that tell me these tidings
ah said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# are a marvellous man but i #marvel# much of thy words that i must die in battle
#marvel# not said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for it is god will your body to be punished for your foul deeds but i may well be sorry said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for i shall die a shameful death to be put in the earth quick and #ye# shall die a worshipful death
and as they talked this came one with the $king_arthur_s_court$ horse and so the $king_arthur_s_court$ mounted on his horse and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ on another and so rode unto carlion
and anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ asked $ector_de_maris$ and $ulfius$ how he was begotten and they told him $uther_pendragon$ was his father and #queen# $lady_igraine$ his #mother#
then he said to $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i will that my #mother# be sent for that i may speak with her and if she say so herself then will i believe it
i am $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and i was he in the child likeness in all haste the #queen# was sent for and she came and brought with her $queen_morgan_le_fay$ her daughter
that was as fair a #lady# as any might be and the $king_arthur_s_court$ welcomed $lady_igraine$ in the best manner chapter xxi
how $ulfius$ impeached #queen# $lady_igraine$ $king_arthur_s_court$ #mother# of #treason# and how a $black_knight$ came and desired to have the death of his #master# revenged
so came $ulfius$ and said openly that the $king_arthur_s_court$ and all might hear that were feasted that #day# #ye# are the falsest #lady# of the world and the most traitress unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ person
i am well #ware# said $ulfius$ what i speak and here is my glove to prove it upon any man that will say the contrary that this #queen# $lady_igraine$ is causer of your great damage and of your great #war#
for an she would have uttered it in the life of $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ of the #birth# of you and how #ye# were begotten #ye# had never had the mortal #war# that #ye# have had for the most part of your barons of your realm knew never whose son #ye# were nor of whom #ye# were begotten and she that bare you of her body should have made it known openly in excusing of her worship and yours and in like wise to all the realm wherefore i prove her false to god and to you and to all your realm and who will say the contrary i will prove it on his body
right beware said $king_arthur_s_court$ what thou sayest thou speakest a great word then spake $lady_igraine$ and said i am a woman
more she said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ knoweth well and #ye# sir $ulfius$ how $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ came to me in the castle of tintagil in the likeness of my lord that was dead three hours to #fore# and thereby gat a child that night upon me
and after the thirteenth #day# $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ wedded me and by his commandment when the child was born it was delivered unto $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and nourished by him
and i may not fight but rather than i should be dishonoured there would some good man take my quarrel and so i saw the child never after nor wot not what is his name
for i knew him never yet and there $ulfius$ said to the #queen# $merlin_gat_excalibur$ is more to blame than #ye#
said the #queen# i bare a child by my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ $uther_pendragon$ but i wot not where he is become
well i wot then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ took the $king_arthur_s_court$ by the hand saying this is your #mother# and therewith sir $ector_de_maris$ bare witness how he nourished him by $uther_pendragon$ commandment
and therewith $king_arthur_s_court$ took his #mother# #queen# $lady_igraine$ in his #arm# and kissed her and either wept upon other and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let make a feast that lasted eight #day#
then on a #day# there came in the #court# a squire on horseback leading a $black_knight$ before him wounded to the death and told him how there was a $black_knight$ in the forest had reared up a #pavilion# by a well and hath slain my #master# a good $black_knight$ his name was miles wherefore i beseech you that my #master# may be buried and that some $black_knight$ may revenge my #master# death
then came $griflet$ that was but a squire and he was but young of the #age# of the $king_arthur_s_court$ so he besought the $king_arthur_s_court$ for all his service that he had done him to give the order of knighthood
how $griflet$ was made $black_knight$ and jousted with a $black_knight$ thou art full young and tender of #age# said $king_arthur_s_court$ for to take so high an order on thee
then the noise was great of that $black_knight$ death in the #court# and every man said his advice chapter xxii sir said $griflet$ i beseech you make me $black_knight$
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ it were great pity to lose $griflet$ for he will be a passing good man when he is of #age# abiding with you the term of his life
and if he adventure his body with yonder $black_knight$ at the #fountain# it is in great peril if ever he come again for he is one of the best #knight# of the world and the strongest man of #arm#
well said $king_arthur_s_court$ so at the desire of $griflet$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ made him $black_knight$ now said $king_arthur_s_court$ unto sir $griflet$ sith
thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy body when thou hast jousted with the $black_knight$ at the #fountain# whether it fall #ye# be on foot or on horseback that right
i have made you $black_knight$ thou must give me a gift what #ye# will said $griflet$ so #ye# shall come again unto me without making any more debate
then took $griflet$ his horse in great haste and dressed his shield and took a spear in his hand and so he rode a great wallop till he came to the #fountain# and thereby he saw a rich #pavilion# and thereby under a #cloth# stood a fair horse well saddled and bridled and on a tree a shield of #diver# colours and a great spear
i will promise you said $griflet$ as you desire then $griflet$ smote on the shield with the butt of his spear that the shield fell down to the ground
with that the $black_knight$ came out of the #pavilion# and said fair $black_knight$ why smote #ye# down my shield for i will joust with you said $griflet$
#ye# do not said the $black_knight$ for #ye# are but young and late made $black_knight$ and your might is nothing to mine
it is better as for that said $griflet$ i will joust with you that is me loath said the $black_knight$ but sith i must needs i will dress me thereto
so the two #knight# ran together that $griflet$ spear all to shivered and there withal he smote $griflet$ through the shield and the left side and #brake# the spear that the truncheon stuck in his body that horse and $black_knight$ fell down
how twelve #knight# came from rome and asked #truage# for this #land# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and how $king_arthur_s_court$ fought with a $black_knight$
when the $black_knight$ saw him lie so on the ground he alighted and was passing heavy for he weened he had slain him and then he unlaced his #helm# and gat him wind and so with the truncheon he set him on his horse and so betook him to god and said he had a mighty heart and if he might live he would prove a passing good $black_knight$
of whence be #ye# said the $black_knight$ sir i am of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# chapter xxiii and so sir $griflet$ rode to the #court# where great dole was made for him
right so came into the #court# twelve #knight# and were aged men and they came from the emperor of rome and they asked of $king_arthur_s_court$ #truage# for this realm other else the emperor would destroy him and his #land#
but through good leeches he was healed and saved well said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# are #messenger# therefore #ye# may say what #ye# will other else #ye# should die therefore
but this is mine #answer# i owe the emperor no #truage# nor #none# will i hold him but on a fair field i shall give him my #truage# that shall be with a sharp spear or else with a sharp sword and that shall not be long by my father #soul# $uther_pendragon$
and therewith the #messenger# departed passingly wroth and $king_arthur_s_court$ as wroth for in evil time came they then for the $king_arthur_s_court$ was passingly wroth for the #hurt# of sir $griflet$
it be #day# his best horse and armour with all that longeth unto his person be without the city or to morrow #day#
right so or to morrow #day# he met with his man and his horse and so mounted up and dressed his shield and took his spear and bade his chamberlain tarry there till he came again
and so $king_arthur_s_court$ rode a soft pace till it was #day# and then was he #ware# of three churls chasing $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and would have slain him
and so he commanded a privy man of his chamber that or then the $king_arthur_s_court$ rode unto them and bade them
flee churls then were they afeard when they saw a $black_knight$ and fled $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts
nay said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ not so for i could save myself an i would and thou art more near thy death than i am for thou goest to the deathward an god be not thy friend
had i not been so as they went thus talking they came to the #fountain# and the rich #pavilion# there by it
then $king_arthur_s_court$ was #ware# where sat a $black_knight$ armed in a chair sir $black_knight$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ for what #cause# abidest thou here that there may no $black_knight$ ride this #way#
this custom said the $black_knight$ have i used and will use maugre who saith nay and who is grieved with my custom let him amend it that will
but if he joust with thee said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i rede thee leave that custom said $king_arthur_s_court$ i will amend it said $king_arthur_s_court$
anon he took his horse and dressed his shield and took a spear and they met so hard either in other shields that all to shivered their spears
i shall defend thee said the $black_knight$ therewith anon $king_arthur_s_court$ pulled out his sword nay not so said the $black_knight$ it is fairer said the $black_knight$ that we twain run more together with sharp spears
so there came a squire and brought two good spears and $king_arthur_s_court$ chose one and he another so they spurred their horses and came together with all their mights that either #brake# their spears to their hands
i will well said $king_arthur_s_court$ an i had any more spears i have enow said the $black_knight$ then $king_arthur_s_court$ set hand on his sword
nay said the $black_knight$ #ye# shall do better #ye# are a passing good jouster as ever i met withal and once for the love of the high order of knighthood let us joust once again
i assent me said $king_arthur_s_court$ anon there were brought two great spears and every $black_knight$ gat a spear and therewith they ran together that $king_arthur_s_court$ spear all to shivered
but the other $black_knight$ hit him so hard in midst of the shield that horse and man fell to the earth and therewith $king_arthur_s_court$ was eager and pulled out his sword and said i will assay thee sir $black_knight$ on foot for i have lost the honour on horseback
i will be on horseback said the $black_knight$ then was $king_arthur_s_court$ wroth and dressed his shield toward him with his sword drawn
when the $black_knight$ saw that he alighted for him thought no worship to have a $black_knight$ at such avail he to be on horseback and he on foot and so he alighted and dressed his shield unto $king_arthur_s_court$
and there began a strong battle with many great #stroke# and so hewed with their swords that the cantels flew in the fields and much blood they bled both that all the place there as they fought was overbled with blood and thus they fought long and rested them and then they went to the battle again and so hurtled together like two rams that either fell to the earth
so at the last they smote together that both their swords met even together but the sword of the $black_knight$ smote $king_arthur_s_court$ sword in two pieces wherefore he was heavy
then said the $black_knight$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ thou art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee and but thou yield thee as overcome and recreant thou shalt die
as for death said $king_arthur_s_court$ welcome be it when it cometh but to yield me unto thee as recreant i had liefer die than to be so shamed
and therewithal the $king_arthur_s_court$ leapt unto $king_pellinore$ and took him by the middle and threw him down and raced off his #helm#
when the $black_knight$ felt that he was adread for he was a passing big man of might and anon he brought $king_arthur_s_court$ under him and raced off his #helm# and would have smitten off his #head#
chapter xxiv how $merlin_gat_excalibur$ saved $king_arthur_s_court$ life and threw an enchantment on $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ and made him to sleep therewithal came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and said $black_knight$ hold thy hand for an thou slay that $black_knight$
thou puttest this realm in the greatest damage that ever was realm for this $black_knight$ is a man of more worship than thou wotest of
then would he have slain him for dread of his wrath and heaved up his sword and therewith $merlin_gat_excalibur$ cast an enchantment to the $black_knight$ that he fell to the earth in a great sleep
why who is he said the $black_knight$ it is $king_arthur_s_court$ then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ took up $king_arthur_s_court$ and rode forth on the $black_knight$ horse
not so worshipful a $black_knight$ as he was i had liefer than the stint of my #land# a year that he were alive
#ye# not said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for he is wholer than #ye# for he is but asleep and will awake within three hours
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ what hast thou done $merlin_gat_excalibur$ hast thou slain this good $black_knight$ by thy crafts there liveth care i told you said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ what a $black_knight$ he was here had #ye# been slain had i not been
do you right good service and his name is $king_pellinore$ and he shall have two sons that shall be passing good men save one they shall have no fellow of prowess and of good living and their names shall be percivale of wales and lamerake of wales and he shall tell you the name of your own son begotten of your sister that shall be the destruction of all this realm
also there liveth not a bigger $black_knight$ than he is one and he shall hereafter chapter xxv how $king_arthur_s_court$ by the #mean# of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ his sword of the #lady# of the lake
right so the $king_arthur_s_court$ and he departed and went unto an hermit that was a good man and a great leech
so the hermit searched all his #wound# and gave him good salves so the $king_arthur_s_court$ was there three #day# and then were his #wound# well amended that he might ride and go and so departed
and as they rode $king_arthur_s_court$ said i have no sword no #force# said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ hereby is a sword that shall be yours an i may
so they rode till they came to a lake the which was a fair water and broad and in the midst of the lake $king_arthur_s_court$ was #ware# of an #arm# clothed in white samite that held a fair sword in that hand
lo said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ yonder is that sword that i spake of with that they saw a $damosel_of_the_lake$ going upon the lake
that is the #lady# of the lake said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and within that lake is a rock and therein is as fair a place as any on earth and richly beseen and this $damosel_of_the_lake$ will come to you anon and then speak #ye# fair to her that she will give you that sword
what $damosel_of_the_lake$ is that said $king_arthur_s_court$ anon withal came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and saluted him and he her again $damosel_of_the_lake$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ what sword is that that yonder the #arm# holdeth above the water
sir $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_arthur_s_court$ said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that sword is mine and if #ye# will give me a gift when i ask it you #ye# shall have it
i would it were mine for i have no sword by my faith said $king_arthur_s_court$ i will give you what gift #ye# will ask
well said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ go #ye# into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword and take it and the #scabbard# with you and i will ask my gift when i see my time
so sir $king_arthur_s_court$ and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ alighted and tied their horses to two trees and so they went into the ship and when they came to the sword that the hand held sir $king_arthur_s_court$ took it up by the handles and took it with him and the #arm# and the hand went under the water
and so they came unto the #land# and rode forth and then sir $king_arthur_s_court$ saw a rich #pavilion# what signifieth yonder #pavilion#
it is the $black_knight$ #pavilion# said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that #ye# fought with last sir $king_pellinore$ but he is out he is not there
he hath ado with a $black_knight$ of yours that hight egglame and they have foughten together but at the last egglame fled and else he had been dead and he hath chased him even to carlion and we shall meet with him anon in the highway
that is well said said $king_arthur_s_court$ now have i a sword now will i wage battle with him and be avenged on him
sir you shall not so said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for the $black_knight$ is weary of fighting and chasing so that #ye# shall have no worship to have ado with him also he will not be lightly matched of one $black_knight$ living and therefore it is my counsel let him pass for he shall do you good service in short time and his sons after his #day#
also #ye# shall see that #day# in short space you shall be right glad to give him your sister to we
d when i see him i will do as #ye# advise said $king_arthur_s_court$ then sir $king_arthur_s_court$ looked on the sword and liked it passing well
whether liketh you better said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ the sword or the #scabbard# me liketh better the sword said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# are more unwise said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for the #scabbard# is worth ten of the swords for whiles
#ye# have the #scabbard# upon you #ye# shall never lose no blood be #ye# never so sore wounded therefore keep well the #scabbard# always with you
so they rode unto carlion and by the #way# they met with sir $king_pellinore$ but $merlin_gat_excalibur$ had done such a craft that $king_pellinore$ saw not $king_arthur_s_court$ and he passed by without any words
i #marvel# said $king_arthur_s_court$ that the $black_knight$ would not speak sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ he saw you not for an he had seen you #ye# had not lightly departed
so they came unto carlion whereof his #knight# were passing glad and when they heard of his adventures they marvelled that he would jeopard his person so alone
but all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor #knight# did
how tidings came to $king_arthur_s_court$ that $king_arthur_s_court$ rience had overcome eleven #king# and how he desired $king_arthur_s_court$ beard to trim his #mantle#
this meanwhile came a #messenger# from $king_arthur_s_court$ rience of north wales and $king_arthur_s_court$ he was of all ireland and of many isles
and this was his message greeting well $king_arthur_s_court$ in this manner wise saying that $king_arthur_s_court$ rience had discomfited and overcome eleven #king# and everych of them did him homage and that was this
they gave him their beards clean flayed off as much as there was wherefore the #messenger# came for $king_arthur_s_court$ beard
for $king_arthur_s_court$ rience had purfled a #mantle# with #king# beards and there lacked one place of the #mantle# wherefore he sent for his beard or else he would enter into his #land# and burn and slay and never leave till he have the #head# and the beard
well said $king_arthur_s_court$ thou hast said thy message the which is the most villainous and lewdest message that ever man heard sent unto a $king_arthur_s_court$
but tell thou thy $king_arthur_s_court$ this i owe him #none# homage nor #none# of mine elders but or it be long to
he shall do me homage on both his knees or else he shall lose his #head# by the faith of my body for this
chapter #xxvi# also thou mayest see my beard is full young yet to make a purfle of it is the most shamefulest message that ever i heard speak of
i have espied thy $king_arthur_s_court$ met never yet with worshipful man but tell him i will have his #head# without he do me homage
then answered a $black_knight$ that hight naram sir i know the $king_arthur_s_court$ well he is a passing good man of his body as few be living and a passing proud man and sir doubt #ye# not he will make #war# on you with a mighty puissance
then the #messenger# departed now is there any here said $king_arthur_s_court$ that knoweth $king_arthur_s_court$ rience well said $king_arthur_s_court$ i shall ordain for him in short time
then $king_arthur_s_court$ let send for all the children born on may #day# begotten of lords and born of #lady# for $merlin_gat_excalibur$ told $king_arthur_s_court$ that he that should destroy him should be born on may #day# wherefore he sent for them all upon pain of death and so there were found many lords sons and all were sent unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and so was $mordred$ sent by $king_arthur_s_court$ lot #wife# and all were put in a ship to the sea and some were four weeks old and some less
and so by #fortune# the ship drave unto a castle and was all to riven and destroyed the most part save that $mordred$ was cast up and a good man found him and nourished him till he was fourteen year old
chapter xxvii how all the children were sent for that were born on may #day# and how $mordred$ was saved and then he brought him to the #court# as it rehearseth afterward toward the end of the death of $king_arthur_s_court$
so many lords and barons of this realm were displeased for their children were so lost and many put the wite on $merlin_gat_excalibur$ more than on $king_arthur_s_court$ so what for dread and for love they held their #peace#
but when the #messenger# came to $king_arthur_s_court$ rience then was he #wood# out of measure and purveyed him for a great host as it rehearseth after in the book of $balin_le_savage$ that followeth next after how by adventure $balin_le_savage$ gat the sword
of a $damosel_of_the_lake$ which came girt with a sword for to find a man of such virtue to draw it out of the #scabbard#
after the death of $uther_pendragon$ reigned $king_arthur_s_court$ his son the which had great #war# in his #day# for to get all england into his hand
explicit liber primus incipit liber secundus book ii chapter i for there were many #king# within the realm of england and in wales scotland and cornwall
so it befell on a time when $king_arthur_s_court$ was at london there came a $black_knight$ and told the $king_arthur_s_court$ tidings how that the $king_arthur_s_court$ rience of north wales had reared a great number of people and were entered into the #land# and burnt and slew the $king_arthur_s_court$ true liege people
if this be true said $king_arthur_s_court$ it were great shame unto mine estate but that he were mightily withstood it is truth said the $black_knight$ for i saw the host myself
well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ let make a cry that all the lords #knight# and #gentleman# of #arm# should draw unto a castle called camelot in those #day# and there the $king_arthur_s_court$ would let make a council general and a great jousts
so when the $king_arthur_s_court$ was come thither with all his baronage and lodged as they seemed best there was come a $damosel_of_the_lake$ the which was sent on message from the great #lady# lile of avelion
and when she came before $king_arthur_s_court$ she told from whom she came and how she was sent on message unto him for these #cause#
then she let her #mantle# fall that was richly furred and then was she girt with a noble sword whereof the $king_arthur_s_court$ had #marvel# and said $damosel_of_the_lake$ for what #cause# are #ye# girt with that sword
this sword that i am girt withal doth me great #sorrow# and cumbrance for i may not be delivered of this sword but by a $black_knight$ but he must be a passing good man of his hands and of his deeds and without villainy or treachery and without #treason#
and if i may find such a $black_knight$ that hath all these virtues he may draw out this sword out of the sheath for i have been at $king_arthur_s_court$ rience it
was told me there were passing good #knight# and he and all his #knight# have assayed it and #none# can speed
this is a great #marvel# said $king_arthur_s_court$ if this be sooth i will myself assay to draw out the sword not presuming upon myself that i am the best $black_knight$ but that i will begin to draw at your sword in giving example to all the barons that they shall assay everych one after other when i have assayed it
then $king_arthur_s_court$ took the sword by the sheath and by the girdle and pulled at it eagerly but the sword would not out
sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ you need not to pull half so hard for he that shall pull it out shall do it with little might
#ye# say well said $king_arthur_s_court$ now assay #ye# all my barons but beware #ye# be not defiled with shame treachery nor guile
then it will not avail said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for he must be a clean $black_knight$ without villainy and of a gentle strain of father side and #mother# side
most of all the barons of the round table that were there at that time assayed all by row but there might #none# speed wherefore the $damosel_of_the_lake$ made great #sorrow# out of measure and said alas
it beseemeth you not now shall i tell you said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ i weened in this #court# had been the best #knight# without treachery or #treason#
by my faith said $king_arthur_s_court$ here are good #knight# as i deem as any be in the world but their grace is not to #help# you wherefore i am displeased
chapter ii how $balin_le_savage$ arrayed like a poor $black_knight$ pulled out the sword which afterward was the #cause# of his death
that had been #prisoner# with him half a year and more for slaying of a $black_knight$ the which was cousin unto $king_arthur_s_court$
the name of this $black_knight$ was called $balin_le_savage$ and by good #mean# of the barons he was delivered out of prison for he was a good man named of his body and he was born in northumberland
and so he went privily into the #court# and saw this adventure whereof it raised his heart and he would assay it as other #knight# did but for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far in press
but in his heart he was fully assured to do as well if his grace happed him as any $black_knight$ that there was
and as the $damosel_of_the_lake$ took her leave of $king_arthur_s_court$ and of all the barons so #departing# this $black_knight$ $balin_le_savage$ called unto her and said $damosel_of_the_lake$ i pray you of your courtesy suffer me as well to assay as these lords though that i be so poorly clothed in my heart meseemeth i am fully assured as some of these others and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well
the $damosel_of_the_lake$ beheld the poor $black_knight$ and saw he was a likely man but for his poor arrayment she thought he should be of no worship without villainy or treachery
then fell it so that time there was a poor $black_knight$ with $king_arthur_s_court$ and then she said unto the $black_knight$
sir it needeth not to put me to more pain or labour for it seemeth not you to speed there as other have failed
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said $balin_le_savage$ worthiness and good tatches and good deeds are not only in arrayment but manhood and worship is hid within man person and many a worshipful $black_knight$ is not known unto all people and therefore worship and hardiness is not in arrayment
then $balin_le_savage$ took the sword by the girdle and sheath and drew it out easily and when he looked on the sword it pleased him much
then had the $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the barons great #marvel# that $balin_le_savage$ had done that adventure and many #knight# had great despite of $balin_le_savage$
certes said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ this is a passing good $black_knight$ and the best that ever i found and most of worship without #treason# treachery or villainy and many #marvel# shall he do
ah by god said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# say sooth therefore #ye# shall assay to do what #ye# may now gentle and courteous $black_knight$ give me the sword again
well said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# are not wise to keep the sword from me for #ye# shall slay with the sword the best friend that #ye# have and the man that #ye# most love in the world and the sword shall be your destruction
i shall take the adventure said $balin_le_savage$ that god will ordain me but the sword #ye# shall not have at this time by the faith of my body
#ye# shall repent it within short time said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for i would have the sword more for your avail than for mine for i am passing heavy for your sake for #ye# will not believe that sword shall be your destruction and that is great pity
nay said $balin_le_savage$ for this sword will i keep but it be taken from me with #force# with that the $damosel_of_the_lake$ departed making great #sorrow#
anon after $balin_le_savage$ sent for his horse and armour and so would depart from the #court# and took his leave of $king_arthur_s_court$
nay said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i suppose #ye# will not depart so lightly from this fellowship i suppose #ye# are displeased that i have shewed you unkindness blame me the less for i was misinformed against you but i weened #ye# had not been such a $black_knight$ as #ye# are of worship and prowess and if #ye# will abide in this #court# among my fellowship i shall so advance you as #ye# shall be pleased
god thank your highness said $balin_le_savage$ your bounty and highness may no man praise half to the value but at this time i must needs depart beseeching you alway of your good grace
truly said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i am right wroth for your #departing# i pray you fair $black_knight$ that #ye# tarry not long and #ye# shall be right welcome to me and to my barons and i shall amend all miss that i have done against you god thank your great lordship said $balin_le_savage$ and therewith made him ready to depart
then the most part of the #knight# of the round table said that $balin_le_savage$ did not this adventure all only by might but by witchcraft
chapter iii how the #lady# of the lake demanded the $black_knight$ #head# that had won the sword or the #maiden# #head#
the meanwhile that this $black_knight$ was making him ready to depart there came into the #court# a #lady# that hight the #lady# of the lake
and she came on horseback richly beseen and saluted $king_arthur_s_court$ and there asked him a gift that he promised her when she gave him the sword
that is sooth said $king_arthur_s_court$ a gift i promised you but i have forgotten the name of my sword that #ye# gave me
#ye# say well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ ask what #ye# will and #ye# shall have it an it lie in my power to give it
well said the #lady# i ask the #head# of the $black_knight$ that hath won the sword or else the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #head# that brought it
i take no #force# though i have both their #head# for he slew my brother a good $black_knight$ and a true and that gentlewoman was causer of my father death
truly said $king_arthur_s_court$ i may not grant neither of their #head# with my worship therefore ask what #ye# will else and i shall fulfil your desire
the name of it said the #lady# is $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that is as much to say as cut steel i will ask #none# other #thing# said the #lady#
when $balin_le_savage$ was ready to depart he saw the #lady# of the lake that by her #mean# had slain $balin_le_savage$ #mother# and he had sought her three years and when it was told him that she asked his #head# of $king_arthur_s_court$ he went to her straight and said evil be you found #ye# would have my #head# and therefore #ye# shall lose yours and with his sword lightly he smote off her #head# before $king_arthur_s_court$
#ye# have shamed me and all my #court# for this was a #lady# that i was beholden to and hither she came under my safe conduct
sir said $balin_le_savage$ me forthinketh of your displeasure for this same #lady# was the untruest #lady# living and by enchantment and sorcery she hath been the destroyer of many good #knight# and she was causer that my #mother# was burnt through her falsehood and treachery
what #cause# soever #ye# had said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# should have forborne her in my presence therefore think not the contrary #ye# shall repent it for such another despite had i never in my #court# therefore withdraw you out of my #court# in all haste
then $balin_le_savage$ took up the #head# of the #lady# and bare it with him to his hostelry and there he met with his squire that was sorry he had displeased $king_arthur_s_court$
alas for shame said $king_arthur_s_court$ why have #ye# done so i shall never forgive you that trespass #ye# may and so they rode forth out of the town
now said $balin_le_savage$ we must depart take thou this #head# and bear it to my friends and tell them how i have sped and tell my friends in northumberland that my most foe is dead
also tell them how i am out of prison and what adventure befell me at the getting of this sword alas said the squire #ye# are greatly to blame for to displease $king_arthur_s_court$
as for that said $balin_le_savage$ i will hie me in all the haste that i may to meet with $king_arthur_s_court$ rience and destroy him either else to die therefore and if it may hap me to win him then will $king_arthur_s_court$ be my good and gracious lord
where shall i meet with you said the squire in $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# said $balin_le_savage$ so his squire and he departed at that time
then $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the #court# made great dole and had shame of the death of the #lady# of the lake
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ buried her richly chapter iv how $merlin_gat_excalibur$ told the adventure of this $damosel_of_the_lake$ at that time there was a $black_knight$
the which was the $king_arthur_s_court$ son of ireland and his name was lanceor the which was an orgulous $black_knight$ and counted himself one of the best of the #court# and he had great despite at $balin_le_savage$ for the achieving of the sword that any should be accounted more hardy or more of prowess and he asked $king_arthur_s_court$ if he would give him leave to ride after $balin_le_savage$ and to revenge the despite that he had done
do your best said $king_arthur_s_court$ i am right wroth with $balin_le_savage$ i would he were quit of the despite that he hath done to me and to my #court#
in the meanwhile came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and there was told him the adventure of the sword and the death of the #lady# of the lake
this same $damosel_of_the_lake$ that here standeth that brought the sword unto your #court# i shall tell you the #cause# of her coming she was the falsest $damosel_of_the_lake$ that liveth
then this lanceor went to his hostelry to make him ready now shall i say you said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ say not so said they
she hath a brother a passing good $black_knight$ of prowess and a full true man and this $damosel_of_the_lake$ loved another $black_knight$ that held her to #paramour# and this good $black_knight$ her brother met with the $black_knight$ that held her to #paramour# and slew him by #force# of his hands
when this false $damosel_of_the_lake$ understood this she went to the #lady# lile of avelion and besought her of #help# to be avenged on her own brother
and so this #lady# lile of avelion took her this sword that she brought with her and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if he be one of the best #knight# of this realm and he should be hard and full of prowess and with that sword he should slay her brother
chapter how $balin_le_savage$ was pursued by sir lanceor $black_knight$ of ireland and how he jousted and slew him this was the #cause# that the $damosel_of_the_lake$ came into this #court#
would god she had not come into this #court# but she came never in fellowship of worship to do good but always great harm and that $black_knight$ that hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed by that sword for the which will be great damage for there liveth not a $black_knight$ of more prowess than he is and he shall do unto you my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ great honour and kindness and it is great pity he shall not endure but a while for of his strength and hardiness
so the $black_knight$ of ireland armed him at all points and dressed his shield on his shoulder and mounted upon horseback and took his spear in his hand and rode after a great pace as much as his horse might go and within a little space on a mountain he had a sight of $balin_le_savage$ and with a loud voice he cried abide $black_knight$ for #ye# shall abide whether #ye# will or nill and the shield that is to #fore# you shall not #help#
when $balin_le_savage$ heard the noise he turned his horse fiercely and said fair $black_knight$ what will #ye# with me will #ye# joust with me
i know it as well as #ye# i know not his match living yea said the irish $black_knight$ therefore come i after you
peradventure said $balin_le_savage$ it had been better to have holden you at home for many a man weeneth to put his #enemy# to a #rebuke# and oft it falleth to himself
i am come from the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ said the $black_knight$ of ireland that come hither for to revenge the despite #ye#
of what #court# be #ye# sent from said $balin_le_savage$ did this #day# to $king_arthur_s_court$ and to his #court# well said $balin_le_savage$ i see
well i must have ado with you that me forthinketh for to grieve $king_arthur_s_court$ or any of his #court# and your quarrel is full simple said $balin_le_savage$ unto me for the #lady# that is dead did me great damage and else would i have been loath as any $black_knight$ that liveth for to slay a #lady#
then they took their spears and came together as much as their horses might drive and the irish $black_knight$ smote $balin_le_savage$ on the shield that all went shivers off his spear and $balin_le_savage$ hit him through the shield and the hauberk perished and so pierced through his body and the horse croup and anon turned his horse fiercely and drew out his sword and wist not that he had slain him and then he saw him lie as a dead corpse
make you ready said the $black_knight$ lanceor and dress you unto me for that one shall abide in the field chapter vi
then he looked by him and was #ware# of a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that came riding full fast as the horse might ride on a fair palfrey
and when she espied that lanceor was slain she made #sorrow# out of measure and said $balin_le_savage$ two bodies thou hast slain and one heart and two hearts in one body and two #soul# thou hast lost
how a $damosel_of_the_lake$ which was love to lanceor slew herself for love and how $balin_le_savage$ met with his brother $balan$ and therewith she took the sword from her love that lay dead and fell to the ground in a swoon
and when she arose she made great dole out of measure the which #sorrow# grieved $balin_le_savage$ passingly sore and he went unto her for to have taken the sword out of her hand but she held it so fast he might not take it out of her hand unless he should have #hurt# her and suddenly she set the pommel to the ground and rove herself through the body
when $balin_le_savage$ espied her deeds he was passing heavy in his heart and ashamed that so fair a $damosel_of_the_lake$ had destroyed herself for the love of his death
alas said $balin_le_savage$ me repenteth sore the death of this $black_knight$ for the love of this $damosel_of_the_lake$ for there was much true love betwixt them both and for #sorrow# might not longer behold him but turned his horse and looked toward a great forest and there he was #ware# by the #arm# of his brother $balan$
then $balan$ said i little weened to have met with you at this sudden adventure i am right glad of your deliverance out of your dolorous prisonment for a man told me in the castle of four stones that #ye# were delivered and that man had seen you in the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and therefore i came hither into this country for here i supposed to find you
and when they were met they put off their #helm# and kissed together and wept for joy and pity anon the $black_knight$
$balin_le_savage$ told his brother of his adventure of the sword and of the death of the #lady# of the lake and how $king_arthur_s_court$ was displeased with him
wherefore he sent this $black_knight$ after me that lieth here dead and the death of this $damosel_of_the_lake$ grieveth me sore so doth it me said $balan$ but #ye# must take the adventure that god will ordain you
truly said $balin_le_savage$ i am right heavy that my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ is displeased with me for he is the most worshipful $black_knight$ that reigneth now on earth and his love will i get or else
for the $king_arthur_s_court$ rience lieth at a #siege# at the castle terrabil and thither will we draw in all haste to prove our worship and prowess upon him
will i put my life in adventure i will well said $balan$ that we do and we will #help# each other as brethren ought to do
how a dwarf reproved $balin_le_savage$ for the death of lanceor and how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ of cornwall found them and made a #tomb# over them
the meanwhile as they talked there came a dwarf from the city of camelot on horseback as much as he might and found the dead bodies wherefore he made great dole and pulled out his hair for #sorrow# and said which of you #knight# have done this deed
chapter vii now go we hence said $balin_le_savage$ and well be we met whereby askest thou it said $balan$ for i would #wit# it said the dwarf
it was i said $balin_le_savage$ that slew this $black_knight$ in my defence for hither he came to chase me and either i must slay him or he me and this $damosel_of_the_lake$ slew herself for his love which repenteth me and for her sake i shall owe all women the better love
alas said the dwarf thou hast done great damage unto thyself for this $black_knight$ that is here dead was one of the most valiantest men that lived and trust well $balin_le_savage$ the kin of this $black_knight$ will chase you through the world till they have slain you
as for that said $balin_le_savage$ i fear not greatly but i am right heavy that i have displeased my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ for the death of this $black_knight$
and when he saw these two bodies dead and understood how they were dead by the two #knight# above said then made the $king_arthur_s_court$ great #sorrow# for the true love that was betwixt them and said i will not depart till i have on this earth made a #tomb# and there he pight his #pavilion# and sought through all the country to find a #tomb# and in a church they found one was fair and rich and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let put them both in the earth and put the #tomb# upon them and wrote the names of them both on the #tomb#
how here lieth lanceor the $king_arthur_s_court$ son of ireland that at his own request was slain by the hands of $balin_le_savage$ and how his #lady# colombe and #paramour# slew herself with her love sword for dole and #sorrow#
how $merlin_gat_excalibur$ prophesied that two the best #knight# of the world should fight there which were sir lancelot and sir $tristram_de_liones$
the meanwhile as this was a doing in came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and seeing all his doing said here shall be in this same place the greatest battle betwixt two #knight# that was or ever shall be and the truest lovers and yet #none# of them shall slay other
and there $merlin_gat_excalibur$ wrote their names upon the #tomb# with letters of gold that should fight in that place whose names were $launcelot_du_lake$ de lake and $tristram_de_liones$
thou art a marvellous man said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ unto $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that speakest of such #marvel# thou art a boistous man and an unlikely to tell of such deeds
so as they talked together there came a $king_arthur_s_court$ of cornwall riding the which hight $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ chapter viii what is thy name said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
at this time said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i will not tell but at that time when sir $tristram_de_liones$ is taken with his sovereign #lady# then #ye# shall hear and know my name and at that time #ye# shall hear tidings that shall not please you
then said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ to $balin_le_savage$ thou hast done thyself great #hurt# because that thou savest not this #lady# that slew herself that might have saved her an thou wouldest
me repenteth said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ because of the death of that #lady# thou shalt strike a #stroke# most dolorous that ever man struck except the #stroke# of our lord for thou shalt #hurt# the truest $black_knight$ and the man of most worship that now liveth and through that #stroke# three kingdoms shall be in great poverty misery and wretchedness twelve years and the $black_knight$ shall not be whole of that #wound# for many years
by the faith of my body said $balin_le_savage$ i might not save her for she slew herself suddenly then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ took his leave of $balin_le_savage$
and $balin_le_savage$ said if i wist it were sooth that #ye# say i should do such a perilous deed as that
i would slay myself to make thee a liar therewith $merlin_gat_excalibur$ vanished away suddenly and then $balan$ and his brother took their leave of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
sir said $balan$ #ye# may see he beareth two swords thereby #ye# may call him the $black_knight$ with the two swords
and so departed $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ unto camelot to $king_arthur_s_court$ and $balin_le_savage$ took the #way# toward $king_arthur_s_court$ rience and as they rode together they met with $merlin_gat_excalibur$ disguised but they knew him not
first said the $king_arthur_s_court$ tell me your name whither ride you said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ we have little to do said the two #knight# to tell thee
but what is thy name said $balin_le_savage$ at this time said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i will not tell it thee it is evil seen said the #knight# that thou art a true man that thou wilt not tell thy name
i can tell you wherefore #ye# ride this #way# for to meet $king_arthur_s_court$ rience but it will not avail you without #ye# have my counsel
as for that said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ be it as it be may ah said $balin_le_savage$ #ye# are $merlin_gat_excalibur$ we will be ruled by your counsel
come on said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ #ye# shall have great worship and look that #ye# do knightly for #ye# shall have great need
as for that said $balin_le_savage$ dread you not we will do what we may chapter ix how $balin_le_savage$ and his brother by the counsel of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ took $king_arthur_s_court$ rience and brought him to $king_arthur_s_court$
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ lodged them in a #wood# among leaves beside the highway and took off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass and laid them down to #rest# them till it was #nigh# midnight
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ bade them rise and make them ready for the $king_arthur_s_court$ was #nigh# them that was stolen away from his host with a three score horses of his best #knight# and twenty of them rode to #fore# to warn the #lady# de vance that the $king_arthur_s_court$ was coming for that night $king_arthur_s_court$ rience should have lain with her
abide said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ here in a strait #way# #ye# shall meet with him and therewith he showed $balin_le_savage$ and his brother where he rode
anon $balin_le_savage$ and his brother met with the $king_arthur_s_court$ and smote him down and wounded him fiercely and laid him to the ground and there they slew on the right hand and the left hand and slew more than forty of his men and the remnant fled
which is the $king_arthur_s_court$ said $balin_le_savage$ then went they again to $king_arthur_s_court$ rience and would have slain him had he not yielded him unto their grace
then said he thus #knight# full of prowess slay me not for by my life #ye# may win and by my death #ye# shall win nothing
with that $merlin_gat_excalibur$ was vanished and came to $king_arthur_s_court$ aforehand and told him how his most #enemy# was taken and discomfited
then said these two #knight# #ye# say sooth and truth and so laid him on a horse litter by whom said $king_arthur_s_court$
anon after came the $black_knight$ with the two swords and $balan$ his brother and brought with them $king_arthur_s_court$ rience of north wales and there delivered him to the porters and charged them with him and so they two returned again in the dawning of the #day#
by two #knight# said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that would please your lordship and to morrow #ye# shall know what #knight# they are $king_arthur_s_court$ came then to $king_arthur_s_court$ rience and said sir $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# are welcome by what adventure come #ye# hither
sir said $king_arthur_s_court$ rience i came hither by an hard adventure who won you said $king_arthur_s_court$ sir said the $king_arthur_s_court$ the $black_knight$ with the two swords and his brother which are two marvellous #knight# of prowess
ah said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i shall tell you it is $balin_le_savage$ that achieved the sword and his brother $balan$ a good $black_knight$ there liveth not a better of prowess and of worthiness and it shall be the greatest dole of him that ever i knew of $black_knight$ for he shall not long endure
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ that is great pity for i am much beholden unto him and i have ill deserved it unto him for his kindness
i know them not said $king_arthur_s_court$ but much i am beholden to them nay said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ he shall do much more for you and that shall #ye# know in haste
but sir are #ye# purveyed said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for to morn the host of nero $king_arthur_s_court$ rience brother will set on you or noon with a great host and therefore make you ready for i will depart from you
how $king_arthur_s_court$ had a battle against nero and $king_arthur_s_court$ lot of $king_lot_of_orkney$ and how $king_arthur_s_court$ lot was deceived by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and how twelve #king# were slain
then $king_arthur_s_court$ made ready his host in ten battles and nero was ready in the field afore the castle terrabil with a great host and he had ten battles with many more people than $king_arthur_s_court$ had
then nero had the vanguard with the most part of his people and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ came to $king_arthur_s_court$ lot of the isle of $king_lot_of_orkney$ and held him with a tale of prophecy till nero and his people were destroyed
and there sir $kay_the_seneschal$ did passingly well that the #day# of his life the worship went never from him and sir hervis de revel did marvellous deeds with $king_arthur_s_court$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ slew that #day# twenty #knight# and maimed forty
at that time came in the $black_knight$ with the two swords and his brother $balan$ but they two did so marvellously that the $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the #knight# marvelled of them and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as angels or devils from hell and $king_arthur_s_court$ said himself they were the best #knight# that ever he saw for they gave such #stroke# that all men had #wonder# of them
in the meanwhile came one to $king_arthur_s_court$ lot and told him while he tarried there nero was destroyed and slain with all his people
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot i am ashamed for by my default there is many a worshipful man slain for an we had been together there had been #none# host under the heaven that had been able for to have matched with us this faiter with his prophecy hath mocked me
all that did $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for he knew well that an $king_arthur_s_court$ lot had been with his body there at the first battle $king_arthur_s_court$ had been slain and all his people destroyed and well $merlin_gat_excalibur$ knew that one of the #king# should be dead that #day# and loath was $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that any of them both should be slain but of the twain he had liefer $king_arthur_s_court$ lot had been slain than $king_arthur_s_court$
now what is best to do said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot of $king_lot_of_orkney$ whether is me better to treat with $king_arthur_s_court$ or to fight for the greater part of our people are slain and destroyed
chapter sir said a $black_knight$ set on $king_arthur_s_court$ for they are weary and forfoughten and we be fresh as for me said $king_arthur_s_court$ lot i would every $black_knight$ would do his part as i would do mine
and then they advanced banners and smote together and all to shivered their spears and $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight# with the #help# of the $black_knight$ with the two swords and his brother $balan$ put $king_arthur_s_court$ lot and his host to the worse
but always $king_arthur_s_court$ lot held him in the foremost front and did marvellous deeds of #arm# for all his host was borne up by his hands for he abode all #knight#
alas he might not endure the which was great pity that so worthy a $black_knight$ as he was one should be overmatched that of late time afore had been a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ and wedded the sister of $king_arthur_s_court$ and for $king_arthur_s_court$ lay by $king_arthur_s_court$ lot #wife# the which was $king_arthur_s_court$ sister and gat on her $mordred$ therefore $king_arthur_s_court$ lot held against $king_arthur_s_court$
so there was a $black_knight$ that was called the $black_knight$ with the strange beast and at that time his right name was called $king_pellinore$ the which was a good man of prowess and he smote a mighty #stroke# at $king_arthur_s_court$ lot as he fought with all his #enemy# and he failed of his #stroke# and smote the horse #neck# that he fell to the ground with $king_arthur_s_court$ lot
and then all the host of $king_lot_of_orkney$ fled for the death of $king_arthur_s_court$ lot and there were slain many #mother# sons
but $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ bare the wite of the death of $king_arthur_s_court$ lot wherefore $sir_gawaine$ revenged the death of his father the tenth year after he was made $black_knight$ and slew $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ with his own hands
also there were slain at that battle twelve #king# on the side of $king_arthur_s_court$ lot with nero and all were buried in the church of saint stephen in camelot and the remnant of #knight# and of others were buried in a great rock
and therewith anon $king_pellinore$ smote him a great #stroke# through the #helm# and #head# unto the brows chapter xi of the interment of twelve #king# and of the prophecy of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and how $balin_le_savage$ should give the dolorous #stroke#
so at the interment came $king_arthur_s_court$ lot #wife# margawse with her four sons $sir_gawaine$ agravaine $gaheris$ and $gareth_of_orkney$ also there came thither $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens sir ewaine father and $queen_morgan_le_fay$ his #wife# that was $king_arthur_s_court$ sister
but of all these twelve #king# $king_arthur_s_court$ let make the #tomb# of $king_arthur_s_court$ lot passing richly and made his #tomb# by his own and then $king_arthur_s_court$ let make twelve images of latten and copper and over gilt it with gold in the sign of twelve #king# and each one of them held a taper of wax that burnt #day# and night and $king_arthur_s_court$ was made in sign of a figure standing above them with a sword drawn in his hand and all the twelve figures had #countenance# like unto men that were overcome
all this made $merlin_gat_excalibur$ by his subtle craft and there he told the $king_arthur_s_court$ when i am dead these tapers shall burn no longer and soon after the adventures of the sangreal shall come among you and be achieved
all these came to the interment also he told $king_arthur_s_court$ how $balin_le_savage$ the worshipful $black_knight$ shall give the dolorous #stroke# whereof shall fall great vengeance
as for $king_pellinore$ said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ he will meet with you soon and as for $balin_le_savage$ he will not be long from you but the other brother will depart #ye# shall see him no more
by my faith said $king_arthur_s_court$ they are two marvellous #knight# and namely $balin_le_savage$ passeth of prowess of any $black_knight$ that ever i found for much beholden am i unto him would god he would abide with me
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ look #ye# keep well the #scabbard# of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for #ye# shall lose no blood while #ye# have the #scabbard# upon you though #ye# have as many #wound# upon you as #ye# may have
so after for great trust $king_arthur_s_court$ betook the #scabbard# to $queen_morgan_le_fay$ his sister and she loved another $black_knight$ better than her husband $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens or $king_arthur_s_court$ and she would have had $king_arthur_s_court$ her brother slain and therefore she let make another #scabbard# like it by enchantment and gave the #scabbard# $merlin_gat_excalibur$ to her love and the $black_knight$ name was called $accolon$ that after had near slain $king_arthur_s_court$
after this $merlin_gat_excalibur$ told unto $king_arthur_s_court$ of the prophecy that there should be a great battle beside salisbury and $mordred$ his own son should be against him
oh where is $balin_le_savage$ and $balan$ and $king_pellinore$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ also he told him that bagdemegus was his cousin and germain unto $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens
how a sorrowful $black_knight$ came before $king_arthur_s_court$ and how $balin_le_savage$ fetched him and how that $black_knight$ was slain by a $black_knight$ invisible
within a #day# or two $king_arthur_s_court$ was somewhat sick and he let pitch his #pavilion# in a meadow and there he laid him down on a pallet to sleep but he might have no #rest#
so he heard a great noise of an horse and therewith the $king_arthur_s_court$ looked out at the porch of the #pavilion# and saw a $black_knight$ coming even by him making great dole
chapter xii right abide fair sir said $king_arthur_s_court$ and tell me wherefore thou makest this #sorrow# #ye# may little amend me said the $black_knight$ and so passed forth to the castle of meliot
anon after there came $balin_le_savage$ and when he saw $king_arthur_s_court$ he alighted off his horse and came to the $king_arthur_s_court$ on foot and saluted him
sir right now came riding this #way# a $black_knight$ making great mourn for what #cause# i cannot tell wherefore i would desire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch again that $black_knight$ either by #force# or else by his good will
i will do more for your lordship than that said $balin_le_savage$ and so he rode more than a pace and found the $black_knight$ with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ in a forest and said sir $black_knight$ #ye# must come with me unto $king_arthur_s_court$ for to tell him of your #sorrow#
by my #head# said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# be welcome that will i not said the $black_knight$ for it will scathe me greatly and do you #none# avail
sir said $balin_le_savage$ i pray you make you ready for #ye# must go with me or else i must fight with you and bring you by #force# and that were me loath to do
will #ye# be my warrant said the $black_knight$ an i go with you yea said $balin_le_savage$ or else i will die therefore
and as they were even afore $king_arthur_s_court$ #pavilion# there came one invisible and smote this $black_knight$ that went with $balin_le_savage$ throughout the body with a spear
alas said the $black_knight$ i am slain under your conduct with a $black_knight$ called garlon therefore take my horse that is better than yours and ride to the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and follow the #quest# that i was in as she will lead you and revenge my death when #ye# may
that shall i do said $balin_le_savage$ and that i make vow unto knighthood and so he departed from this $black_knight$ with great #sorrow#
so $king_arthur_s_court$ let bury this $black_knight$ richly and made a mention on his #tomb# how there was slain herlews le berbeus and by whom the treachery was done the $black_knight$ garlon
and so he made him ready to go with $balin_le_savage$ and left the $damosel_of_the_lake$ still but ever the $damosel_of_the_lake$ bare the truncheon of the spear with her that sir herlews was slain withal
how $balin_le_savage$ and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ met with a $black_knight$ which was in likewise slain and how the $damosel_of_the_lake$ bled for the custom of a castle
so $balin_le_savage$ and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ rode into a forest and there met with a $black_knight$ that had been a hunting and that $black_knight$ asked $balin_le_savage$ for what #cause# he made so great #sorrow#
chapter xiii me list not to tell you said $balin_le_savage$ now said the $black_knight$ an i were armed as #ye# be i would fight with you
that should little need said $balin_le_savage$ i am not afeard to tell you and told him all the #cause# how it was
ah said the $black_knight$ is this all here i ensure you by the faith of my body never to depart from you while my life lasteth
and as they came by an hermitage even by a churchyard there came the $black_knight$ garlon invisible and smote this $black_knight$ perin de mountbeliard through the body with a spear
and so they went to the hostelry and armed them and so rode forth with $balin_le_savage$ alas said the $black_knight$ i am slain by this traitor $black_knight$ that rideth invisible
alas said $balin_le_savage$ it is not the first despite he hath done me and there the hermit and $balin_le_savage$ buried the $black_knight$ under a rich stone and a #tomb# royal
and on the morn they found letters of gold written how $sir_gawaine$ shall revenge his father death $king_arthur_s_court$ lot on the $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$
anon after this $balin_le_savage$ and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ rode till they came to a castle and there $balin_le_savage$ alighted and he and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ went to go into the castle and anon as $balin_le_savage$ came within the castle gate
the portcullis fell down at his back and there fell many men about the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and would have slain her when $balin_le_savage$ saw that he was sore aggrieved for he might not #help# the $damosel_of_the_lake$
then he went up into the tower and leapt over walls into the ditch and #hurt# him not and anon he pulled out his sword and would have foughten with them
and they all said nay they would not fight with him for they did nothing but the old custom of the castle and told him how their #lady# was sick and had lain many years and she might not be whole
but if she had a dish of silver full of blood of a clean maid and a $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter and therefore the custom of this castle is there shall
well said $balin_le_savage$ she shall bleed as much as she may bleed but i will not lose the life of her whiles my life lasteth
no $damosel_of_the_lake$ pass this #way# but she shall bleed of her blood in a silver dish full and so $balin_le_savage$ made her to bleed by her good will but her blood helped not the #lady#
and so he and she rested there all night and had there right good #cheer# and on the morn they passed on their #way#
and as it telleth after in the sangreal that sir percivale sister helped that #lady# with her blood whereof she was dead
how $balin_le_savage$ met with that $black_knight$ named garlon at a feast and there he slew him to have his blood to heal therewith the son of his host
then they rode three or four #day# and never met with adventure and by hap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well at ease
chapter xiv and as they sat at their supper $balin_le_savage$ overheard one complain grievously by him in a chair what is this noise said $balin_le_savage$
i was but late at a jousting and there i jousted with a $black_knight$ that is brother unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ and twice smote
forsooth said his host i will tell you i him down and then he promised to quit me on my best friend
and so he wounded my son that cannot be whole till i have of that $black_knight$ blood and he rideth alway invisible but i know not his name
his name is garlon he hath slain two #knight# of mine in the same manner therefore i had liefer meet with that $black_knight$ than all the gold in this realm for the despite he hath done me
well said his host i shall tell you $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ of listeneise hath made do cry in all this country a great feast that shall be within these twenty #day# and no $black_knight$ may come there but if he bring his #wife# with him or his #paramour# and that $black_knight$ your #enemy# and mine #ye# shall see that #day#
ah said $balin_le_savage$ i know that $black_knight$ then i behote you said $balin_le_savage$ part of his blood to heal your son withal
so on the morn they rode all three toward $king_pellam$ and they had fifteen #day# journey or they came thither and that same #day# began the great feast
and so they alighted and stabled their horses and went into the castle but $balin_le_savage$ host might not be let in because he had no #lady#
then $balin_le_savage$ was well received and brought unto a chamber and unarmed him and there were brought him robes to his pleasure and would have had $balin_le_savage$ leave his sword behind him
said $balin_le_savage$ that do i not for it is the custom of my country a $black_knight$ always to keep his weapon with him and that custom will i keep or else i will depart as i came
then they gave him leave to wear his sword and so he went unto the castle and was set among #knight# of worship and his #lady# afore him
we will be forward to morn said his host nay soon $balin_le_savage$ asked a $black_knight$ is there not a $black_knight$ in this #court# whose name is garlon
yonder he goeth said a $black_knight$ he with the black face he is the marvellest $black_knight$ that is now living for he destroyeth many good #knight# for he goeth invisible
then $balin_le_savage$ advised him long if i slay him here i shall not escape and if i leave him now peradventure
ah well said $balin_le_savage$ is that he i shall never meet with him again at such a steven and much harm he will do an he live
therewith this garlon espied that this $balin_le_savage$ beheld him and then he came and smote $balin_le_savage$ on the face with the back of his hand and said $black_knight$ why beholdest me so
thou sayest sooth said $balin_le_savage$ this is not the first despite that thou hast done me and therefore i will do what i came for and rose up fiercely and clave his #head# to the shoulders
for shame therefore eat thy meat and do that thou came for give me the truncheon said $balin_le_savage$ to his #lady# wherewith
and therewith $balin_le_savage$ smote him through the body and said openly with that truncheon thou hast slain a good $black_knight$ and now it sticketh in thy body
he slew your $black_knight$ anon she gave it him for alway she bare the truncheon with her and then $balin_le_savage$ called unto him his host saying now may #ye# fetch blood enough to heal your son withal
how $balin_le_savage$ fought with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ and how his sword #brake# and how he gat a spear wherewith he smote the dolorous #stroke#
anon all the #knight# arose from the table for to set on $balin_le_savage$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ himself arose up fiercely and said $black_knight$ hast thou slain my brother
chapter xv thou shalt die therefore or thou depart well said $balin_le_savage$ do it yourself yes said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ there shall no man have ado with thee
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ caught in his hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at $balin_le_savage$ but $balin_le_savage$ put the sword betwixt his #head# and the #stroke# and therewith his sword burst in sunder
and when $balin_le_savage$ was weaponless he ran into a chamber for to seek some weapon and so from chamber to chamber and no weapon he could find and always $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ after him
and at the last he entered into a chamber that was marvellously well dight and richly and a #bed# arrayed with #cloth# of gold the richest that might be thought and one lying therein and thereby stood a table of clean gold with four pillars of silver that bare up the table and upon the table stood a marvellous spear strangely wrought
and when $balin_le_savage$ saw that spear he gat it in his hand and turned him to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ and smote him passingly sore with that spear that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ fell down in a swoon and therewith the castle roof and walls #brake# and fell to the earth and $balin_le_savage$ fell down so that he might not stir foot nor hand
and so the most part of the castle that was fallen down through that dolorous #stroke# lay upon $king_pellam$ and $balin_le_savage$ three #day#
but myself for the love of my brother chapter xvi how $balin_le_savage$ was delivered by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and saved a $black_knight$ that would have slain himself for love
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ came thither and took up $balin_le_savage$ and gat him a good horse for his was dead and bade him ride out of that country
and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ lay so many years sore wounded and might never be whole till $galahad$ the haut prince healed him in the #quest# of the sangreal for in that place was part of the blood of our lord jesus christ that joseph of arimathea brought into this #land# and there himself lay in that rich #bed#
and that was the same spear that longius smote our lord to the heart and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ was #nigh# of joseph kin and that was the most worshipful man that lived in those #day# and great pity it was of his #hurt# for through that #stroke# turned to great dole tray and tene
i would have my $damosel_of_the_lake$ said $balin_le_savage$ lo said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ where she lieth dead then departed $balin_le_savage$ from $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and said in this world we meet never no more
and all that were alive cried $balin_le_savage$ thou hast caused great damage in these countries for the dolorous #stroke# thou gavest unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ three countries are destroyed and doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the last
so he rode forth through the fair countries and cities and found the people dead slain on every side when $balin_le_savage$ was past those countries he was passing fain
and at the last he came into a fair forest in a #valley# and was #ware# of a tower and there beside he saw a great horse of #war# tied to a tree and there beside sat a fair $black_knight$ on the ground and made great mourning and he was a likely man and a well made
so he rode eight #day# or he met with adventure $balin_le_savage$ said god save you why be #ye# so heavy tell me and i will amend it an i may to my power
sir $black_knight$ said he again thou dost me great grief for i was in merry thoughts and now thou puttest me to more pain
$balin_le_savage$ went a little from him and looked on his horse then heard $balin_le_savage$ him say thus ah fair #lady# why have #ye# broken my promise for thou promisest me to meet me here by noon and i may curse thee that ever #ye# gave me this sword for with this sword i slay myself and pulled it out
and therewith $balin_le_savage$ stert unto him and took him by the hand let go my hand said the $black_knight$ or else i shall slay thee
that shall not need said $balin_le_savage$ for i shall promise you my #help# to get you your #lady# an #ye# will tell me where she is
ah sir i know you well enough #ye# are the $black_knight$ with the two swords and the man of most prowess of your hands living
my name is garnish of the mount a poor man son but by my prowess and hardiness a duke hath made me $black_knight$ and gave me #land# his name is duke hermel and his daughter is she that i love and she me as i deemed
what is your name said the $black_knight$ my name is $balin_le_savage$ what is your name said $balin_le_savage$ how far is she hence said $balin_le_savage$
but six mile said the $black_knight$ now ride we hence said these two #knight# so they rode more than a pace till that they came to a fair castle well walled and ditched
i will into the castle said $balin_le_savage$ and look if she be there so he went in and searched from chamber to chamber and found her #bed# but she was not there
then $balin_le_savage$ looked into a fair little garden and under a laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quilt of green samite and a $black_knight$ in her #arm# fast halsing either other and under their #head# grass and herbs
when $balin_le_savage$ saw her lie so with the foulest $black_knight$ that ever he saw and she a fair #lady# then $balin_le_savage$ went through all the chambers again and told the $black_knight$ how he found her as she had slept fast and so brought him in the place there
how that $black_knight$ slew his love and a $black_knight$ lying by her and after how he slew himself with his own sword and how $balin_le_savage$ rode toward a castle where he lost his life
and when garnish beheld her so lying for pure #sorrow# his mouth and nose burst out a bleeding and with his sword he smote off both their #head# and then he made #sorrow# out of measure and said $balin_le_savage$ much #sorrow# hast thou brought unto me for hadst thou not shewed me that sight i should have passed my #sorrow#
forsooth said $balin_le_savage$ i did it to this intent that it should better thy courage and that #ye# might see and know her falsehood and to #cause# you to leave love of such a #lady# god knoweth i did #none# other
she lay fast sleeping chapter #xvii# but as i would #ye# did to me alas said garnish now is my #sorrow# double that i may not endure
now have i slain that i most loved in all my life and therewith suddenly he rove himself on his own sword unto the hilts
when $balin_le_savage$ saw that he dressed him thenceward lest folk would say he had slain them and so he rode forth and within three #day# he came by a cross and thereon were letters of gold written that said it is not for no $black_knight$ alone to ride toward this castle
then saw he an old hoar #gentleman# coming toward him that said $balin_le_savage$ thou passest thy bounds to come this #way# therefore turn again and it will avail thee
and he vanished away anon and so he heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a beast
that blast said $balin_le_savage$ is blown for me for i am the #prize# and yet am i not dead anon withal
that welcomed him with fair semblant and made him passing good #cheer# unto his sight and led him into the castle and there was dancing and minstrelsy and all manner of joy
then the chief #lady# of the castle said $black_knight$ with the two swords #ye# must have ado and joust with a $black_knight$ hereby that keepeth an island for there may no man pass this #way#
he saw an hundred #lady# and many #knight# but he must joust or he pass that is an unhappy custom said $balin_le_savage$ that a $black_knight$ may not pass this #way# but if he joust
since i shall thereto i am ready but travelling men are oft weary and their horses too but though my horse be weary my heart is not weary i would be fain there my death should be
#ye# shall not have ado but with one $black_knight$ said the #lady# well said $balin_le_savage$ sir said a $black_knight$ to $balin_le_savage$ methinketh your shield is not good i will lend you a bigger
and so he took the shield that was unknown and left his own and so rode unto the island and put him and his horse in a great boat and when he came on the other side he met with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ and she said $black_knight$ $balin_le_savage$ why have #ye# left your own shield
#ye# should have been known it is great pity of you as ever was of $black_knight$ for of thy prowess and hardiness thou hast no fellow living
me repenteth said $balin_le_savage$ that ever i came within this country but i may not turn now again for shame and what adventure shall fall to me be it life or death i will take the adventure that shall come to me
and then he looked on his armour and understood he was well armed and therewith blessed him and mounted upon his horse
how $balin_le_savage$ met with his brother $balan$ and how each of them slew other unknown till they were wounded to death
then afore him he saw come riding out of a castle a $black_knight$ and his horse trapped all red and himself in the same colour
when this $black_knight$ in the red beheld $balin_le_savage$ him thought it should be his brother $balin_le_savage$ by #cause# of his two swords but by #cause# he knew not his shield
thereof i pray you alas #ye# have put yourself in great danger for by your shield chapter xviii he deemed it was not he
and so they aventryd their spears and came marvellously fast together and they smote each other in the shields but their spears and their course were so big that it bare down horse and man that they lay both in a swoon
and $balan$ was the first that rose on foot and drew his sword and went toward $balin_le_savage$ and he arose and went against him but $balan$ smote $balin_le_savage$ first and he put up his shield and smote him through the shield and tamed his #helm#
then $balin_le_savage$ smote him again with that unhappy sword and well #nigh# had felled his brother $balan$ and so they fought there together till their breaths failed
but $balin_le_savage$ was bruised sore with the fall of his horse for he was weary of travel then $balin_le_savage$ looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand full of #lady#
so they went unto battle again and wounded everych other dolefully and then they breathed ofttimes and so went unto battle that all the place there as they fought was blood red
but they had either smitten other seven great #wound# so that the least of them might have been the death of the mightiest #giant# in this world
then they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to hear of that battle for the great blood shedding and their hauberks unnailed that naked they were on every side
and at that time there was #none# of them both at last $balan$ the younger brother withdrew him a little and laid him down
then said $balin_le_savage$ what $black_knight$ art thou for or now i found never no $black_knight$ that matched me my name is said he $balan$ brother unto the good $black_knight$ $balin_le_savage$
then $balan$ yede on all four feet and hands and put off the #helm# off his brother and might not know him by the visage
it was so ful hewn and bled but when he awoke he said $balan$ my brother thou hast slain me
alas said $balin_le_savage$ that ever i should see this #day# and therewith he fell backward in a swoon and i thee
alas said $balan$ that ever i saw this #day# that through mishap i might not know you for i espied well your two swords but by #cause# #ye# had another shield i deemed #ye# had been another $black_knight$
alas said $balin_le_savage$ all that made an unhappy $black_knight$ in the castle for he caused me to leave my own shield to our both destruction and if i might live i would destroy that castle for ill customs
that were well done said $balan$ for i had never grace to depart from them since that i came hither for here it happed me to slay a $black_knight$ that kept this island and since might i never depart and no more should #ye# brother an #ye# might have slain me as #ye# have and escaped yourself with the life
right so came the #lady# of the tower with four #knight# and six #lady# and six yeomen unto them and there she heard how they made their moan either to other and said we came both out of one #tomb# that is to say one #mother# belly and so shall we lie both in one pit
so $balan$ prayed the #lady# of her gentleness for his true service that she would bury them both in that same place there the battle was done
wherefore all the wide world shall speak of us both and she granted them with weeping it should be done richly in the best manner
now will #ye# send for a priest that we may receive our sacrament and receive the blessed body of our lord jesus christ
now said $balin_le_savage$ when we are buried in one #tomb# and the mention made over us how two brethren slew each other there will never good $black_knight$ nor good man see our #tomb#
yea said the #lady# it shall be done and so she sent for a priest and gave them their rights but they will pray for our #soul#
then anon $balan$ died but $balin_le_savage$ died not till the midnight after and so were they buried both and the #lady# let make a mention of $balan$ how he was there slain by his brother hands but she knew not $balin_le_savage$ name
and so all the #lady# and gentlewomen wept for pity chapter xix how $merlin_gat_excalibur$ buried them both in one #tomb# and of $balin_le_savage$ sword
in the morn came $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and let write $balin_le_savage$ name on the #tomb# with letters of gold that here lieth $balin_le_savage$ that was the $black_knight$ with the two swords and he that smote the dolorous #stroke#
also $merlin_gat_excalibur$ let make there a #bed# that there should never man lie therein but he went out of his #wit#
yet $launcelot_du_lake$ de lake fordid that #bed# through his noblesse and anon after $balin_le_savage$ was dead $merlin_gat_excalibur$ took his sword and took off the pommel and set on another pommel
so $merlin_gat_excalibur$ bade a $black_knight$ that stood afore him handle that sword and he assayed and he might not handle it
this is the #cause# said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ there shall never man handle this sword but the best $black_knight$ of the world and that shall be sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or else $galahad$ his son and $launcelot_du_lake$ with this sword shall slay the man that in the world he loved best that shall be $sir_gawaine$
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ let make a #bridge# of iron and of steel into that island and it was but half a foot broad and there shall never man pass that #bridge# nor have hardiness to go over but if he were a passing good man and a good $black_knight$ without treachery or villainy
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ laughed why laugh #ye# said the $black_knight$ all this he let write in the pommel of the sword also the #scabbard# of $balin_le_savage$ sword $merlin_gat_excalibur$ left it on this side the island that $galahad$ should find it
also $merlin_gat_excalibur$ let make by his subtilty that $balin_le_savage$ sword was put in a marble stone standing upright as great as a mill stone and the stone hoved always above the water and did many years and so by adventure it swam down the stream to the city of camelot that is in english winchester
and that same #day# $galahad$ the haut prince came with $king_arthur_s_court$ and so $galahad$ brought with him the #scabbard# and achieved the sword that was there in the marble stone hoving upon the water
soon after this was done $merlin_gat_excalibur$ came to $king_arthur_s_court$ and told him of the dolorous #stroke# that $balin_le_savage$ gave to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellam$ and how $balin_le_savage$ and $balan$ fought together the marvellest battle that ever was heard of and how they were buried both in one #tomb#
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ this is the greatest pity that ever i heard tell of two #knight# for in the world
and on whitsunday he achieved the sword as it is rehearsed in the book of sangreal i know not such two #knight#
thus endeth the tale of $balin_le_savage$ and of $balan$ two brethren born in northumberland good #knight# sequitur iii liber book iii
how $king_arthur_s_court$ took a #wife# and wedded $dame_guenever$ daughter to $king_leodegrance$ $king_arthur_s_court$ of the #land# of cameliard with whom he had the round table
in the beginning of $king_arthur_s_court$ after he was chosen $king_arthur_s_court$ by adventure and by grace for the most part of the barons knew not that he was $uther_pendragon$ son but as $merlin_gat_excalibur$ made it openly known
but yet many #king# and lords held great #war# against him for that #cause# but well $king_arthur_s_court$ overcame them all for the most part the #day# of his life
chapter i he was ruled much by the counsel of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ so it fell on a time $king_arthur_s_court$ said unto $merlin_gat_excalibur$
my barons will let me have no #rest# but needs i must take a #wife# and i will #none# take but by thy counsel and by thine advice
it is well done said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that #ye# take a #wife# for a man of your bounty and noblesse should not be without a #wife#
yea said $king_arthur_s_court$ i love $dame_guenever$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter $king_leodegrance$ of the #land# of cameliard the which holdeth in his house the table round that #ye# told he had of my father $uther_pendragon$
and this $damosel_of_the_lake$ is the most valiant and fairest #lady# that i know living or yet that ever i could find
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ as of her beauty and fairness she is one of the fairest alive but an #ye# loved her not so well
as #ye# do i should find you a $damosel_of_the_lake$ of beauty and of goodness that should like you and please you an your heart were not set but there as a man heart is set he will be loath to return
but $merlin_gat_excalibur$ warned the $king_arthur_s_court$ covertly that $dame_guenever$ was not wholesome for him to take to #wife# for he warned him that $launcelot_du_lake$ should love her and she him again and so he turned his tale to the adventures of sangreal
then $merlin_gat_excalibur$ desired of the $king_arthur_s_court$ for to have men with him that should enquire of $dame_guenever$ and so the $king_arthur_s_court$ granted him and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ went forth unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_leodegrance$ of cameliard and told him of the desires of the $king_arthur_s_court$ that he would have unto his #wife# $dame_guenever$ his daughter
that is to me said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_leodegrance$ the best tidings that ever i heard that so worthy a $king_arthur_s_court$ of prowess and noblesse
now is there any that #ye# love more than another that is truth said $king_arthur_s_court$ will wed my daughter and as for my #land# i will give him wist
i it might please him but he hath #land# enow him needeth #none# but i shall send him a gift shall please him much more for i shall give him the table round the which $uther_pendragon$ gave me and when it is full complete there is an hundred #knight# and fifty
and as for an hundred good #knight# i have myself but i faute fifty for so many have been slain in my #day#
and so $king_leodegrance$ delivered his daughter $dame_guenever$ unto $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and the table round with the hundred #knight# and so they rode freshly with great royalty what by water and what by #land# till that they came #nigh# unto london
when $king_arthur_s_court$ heard of the coming of $dame_guenever$ and the hundred #knight# with the table round then $king_arthur_s_court$ made great joy for her coming and that rich present and said openly this fair #lady# is passing welcome unto me for i have loved her long and therefore there is nothing so lief to me
chapter ii how the #knight# of the round table were ordained and their #siege# blessed by the bishop of canterbury and these #knight# with the round table please me more than right great riches
and in all haste the $king_arthur_s_court$ let ordain for the marriage and the coronation in the most honourable wise that could be devised
now $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ go thou and espy me in all this #land# fifty #knight# which be of most prowess and worship
within short time $merlin_gat_excalibur$ had found such #knight# that should fulfil twenty and eight #knight# but no more he could find
then the bishop of canterbury was fetched and he blessed the #siege# with great royalty and devotion and there set the eight and twenty #knight# in their #siege#
and when this was done $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said fair sirs #ye# must all arise and come to $king_arthur_s_court$ for to do him homage he will have the better will to maintain you
and so they arose and did their homage and when they were gone $merlin_gat_excalibur$ found in every #siege# letters of gold that told the #knight# names that had sitten therein
but two #siege# were void and so anon came young $sir_gawaine$ and asked the $king_arthur_s_court$ a gift ask said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and i shall grant it you
i will do it with a good will said $king_arthur_s_court$ and do unto you all the worship that i may for i must by reason #ye# are my nephew my sister son
sir i ask that #ye# will make me $black_knight$ that same #day# #ye# shall wed fair $dame_guenever$ chapter iii how a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired $king_arthur_s_court$ to make his son $black_knight$
there came a poor man into the #court# and brought with him a fair young man of eighteen years of #age# riding upon a lean mare and the poor man asked all men that he met where shall i find $king_arthur_s_court$
forthwithal yonder he is said the #knight# wilt thou anything with him yea said the poor man therefore i came hither
anon as he came before the $king_arthur_s_court$ he saluted him and said $king_arthur_s_court$ the flower of all #knight# and #king# i beseech $o_jesu$ save thee
sir it was told me that at this time of your marriage #ye# would give any man the gift that he would ask out except that were unreasonable
that is truth said the $king_arthur_s_court$ such cries i let make and that will i hold so it apair not my realm nor mine estate
#ye# say well and graciously said the poor man sir i ask nothing else but that #ye# will make my son here a $black_knight$
it is a great #thing# thou askest of me said the $king_arthur_s_court$ what is thy name said the $king_arthur_s_court$ to the poor man
nay sir said aries this desire cometh of my son and not of me for i shall tell you i have thirteen sons and all they will fall to what labour i put them and will be right glad to do labour but this child will not labour for me for anything that my #wife# or i may do but always he will be shooting or casting darts and glad for to see battles and to behold #knight# and
sir my name is aries the cowherd whether cometh this of thee or of thy son said the $king_arthur_s_court$ always #day# and night he desireth of me to be made a $black_knight$
what is thy name said the $king_arthur_s_court$ unto the young man sir my name is $tor$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ beheld him fast and saw he was passingly well visaged and passingly well made of his years
well said $king_arthur_s_court$ unto aries the cowherd fetch all thy sons afore me that i may see them and so the poor man did and all were shaped much like the poor man
but $tor$ was not like #none# of them all in shape nor in #countenance# for he was much more than any of them
now said $king_arthur_s_court$ unto the cow herd where is the sword he shall be made $black_knight$ withal it is here said $tor$
then $tor$ alighted off his mare and pulled out his sword kneeling and requiring the $king_arthur_s_court$ that he would make him $black_knight$ and that he might be a $black_knight$ of the table round
as for a $black_knight$ i will make you and therewith smote him in the #neck# with the sword saying be #ye# a good $black_knight$ and so i pray to god so #ye# may be and if #ye# be of prowess and of worthiness #ye# shall be a $black_knight$ of the table round
take it out of the sheath said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and require me to make you a $black_knight$ now $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ say whether this $tor$ shall be a good $black_knight$ or no
yea sir he ought to be a good $black_knight$ for he is come of as good a man as any is alive and of #king# blood
this poor man aries the cowherd is not his father he is nothing sib to him for $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ is his father
how so sir said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i shall tell you said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ i suppose nay said the cowherd fetch thy #wife# afore me said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and she shall not say nay
anon the #wife# was fetched which was a fair housewife and there she answered $merlin_gat_excalibur$ full womanly and there she told the $king_arthur_s_court$ and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that when she was a maid and went to milk kine there met with her a stern $black_knight$ and half by #force# he had my maidenhead and at that time he begat my son $tor$ and he took away from me my greyhound that i had that time with me and said that he would keep the greyhound for my love
ah said the cowherd i weened not this but i may believe it well for he had never no tatches of me
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ it is more for your worship than #hurt# for your father is a good man and a $king_arthur_s_court$ and he may right well advance you and your #mother# for #ye# were begotten or ever she was wedded
sir said $tor$ unto $merlin_gat_excalibur$ dishonour not my #mother# that is truth said the #wife# it is the less grief unto me said the cowherd
so on the morn $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ came to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ which had great joy of him and told him of $tor$ how he was his son and how he had made him $black_knight$ at the request of the cowherd
chapter iv how sir $tor$ was known for son of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ and how $sir_gawaine$ was made $black_knight$ when $king_pellinore$ beheld $tor$ he pleased him much
so the $king_arthur_s_court$ made $sir_gawaine$ $black_knight$ but $tor$ was the first he made at the feast what is the #cause# said $king_arthur_s_court$ that there be two places void in the #siege#
but in the #siege# perilous there shall no man sit therein but one and if there be any so hardy to do it he shall be destroyed and he that shall sit there shall have no fellow
and therewith $merlin_gat_excalibur$ took $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ by the hand and in the one hand next the two #siege# and the #siege# perilous he said in open audience
sir said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ there shall no man sit in those places but they that shall be of most worship this is your place and best #ye# are worthy to sit therein of any that is here
thereat sat $sir_gawaine$ in great envy and told $gaheris$ his brother yonder $black_knight$ is put to great worship the which grieveth me sore for he slew our father $king_arthur_s_court$ lot therefore i will slay him said $sir_gawaine$ with a sword that was sent me that is passing trenchant
#ye# shall not so said $gaheris$ at this time for at this time i am but a squire and when i am made $black_knight$ i will be avenged on him and therefore brother it is best #ye# suffer till another time that we may have him out of the #court# for an we did
how at feast of the #wedding# of $king_arthur_s_court$ to $dame_guenever$ a white hart came into the hall and thirty couple #hound# and how a brachet pinched the hart which was taken away
then was the high feast made ready and the $king_arthur_s_court$ was wedded at camelot unto $dame_guenever$ in the church of saint stephen with great solemnity
and as every man was set after his degree $merlin_gat_excalibur$ went to all the #knight# of the round table and bade them sit still that #none# of them remove
so we should trouble this high feast i will well said $sir_gawaine$ as #ye# will chapter for #ye# shall see a strange and a marvellous adventure
right so as they sat there came running in a white hart into the hall and a white brachet next him and thirty couple of black running #hound# came after with a great cry and the hart went about the table round as he went by other boards
the white brachet bit him by the buttock and pulled out a piece wherethrough the hart leapt a great leap and overthrew a $black_knight$ that sat at the board side and therewith the $black_knight$ arose and took up the brachet and so went forth out of the hall and took his horse and rode his #way# with the brachet
right so anon came in a #lady# on a white palfrey and cried aloud to $king_arthur_s_court$ sir suffer me not to have this despite for the brachet was mine that the $black_knight$ led away
with this there came a $black_knight$ riding all armed on a great horse and took the #lady# away with him with #force# and ever she cried and made great dole
i may not do therewith said the $king_arthur_s_court$ when she was gone the $king_arthur_s_court$ was glad for she made such a noise
nay said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ #ye# may not leave these adventures so lightly for these adventures must be brought again or else it would be disworship to you and to your feast
i will said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that all be done by your advice then said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ let call $sir_gawaine$ for he must bring again the white hart
also sir #ye# must let call sir $tor$ for he must bring again the brachet and the $black_knight$ or else slay him
also let call $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ for he must bring again the #lady# and the $black_knight$ or else slay him and these three #knight# shall do marvellous adventures or they come again
then were they called all three as it rehearseth afore and each of them took his charge and armed them surely
how $sir_gawaine$ rode for to fetch again the hart and how two brethren fought each against other for the hart
$sir_gawaine$ rode more than a pace and $gaheris$ his brother that rode with him instead of a squire to do him service
so as they rode they saw two #knight# fight on horseback passing sore so $sir_gawaine$ and his brother rode betwixt them and asked them for what #cause# they fought so
the one $black_knight$ answered and said we fight for a simple matter for we two be two brethren born and begotten of one man and of one woman
but $sir_gawaine$ had the first request and therefore we will begin at him chapter vi alas said $sir_gawaine$ why do #ye# so
sir said the elder there came a white hart this #way# this #day# and many #hound# chased him and a white brachet was alway next him and we understood it was adventure made for the high feast of $king_arthur_s_court$ and therefore i would have gone after to have won me worship and here my younger brother said he would go after the hart for he was better $black_knight$ than i and for this #cause# we fell at debate and so we thought to prove which of us both was better $black_knight$
this is a simple #cause# said $sir_gawaine$ uncouth men #ye# should debate withal and not brother with brother therefore but if you will do by my counsel i will have ado with you that is #ye# shall yield you unto me and that #ye# go unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and yield you unto his grace
sir $black_knight$ said the two brethren we are forfoughten and much blood have we lost through our wilfulness and therefore we would be loath to have ado with you
then do as i will have you said $sir_gawaine$ we will agree to fulfil your will but by whom shall we say that we be thither sent
#ye# may say by the $black_knight$ that followeth the #quest# of the hart that was white now what is your name said $sir_gawaine$
sorlouse of the forest said the elder and my name is said the younger $brian_de_les_isles$ of the forest and so they departed and went to the $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and $sir_gawaine$ on his #quest#
and as $sir_gawaine$ followed the hart by the cry of the #hound# even afore him there was a great river and the hart swam over and as $sir_gawaine$ would follow after there stood a $black_knight$ over the other side and said sir $black_knight$ come not over after this hart but if thou wilt joust with me
i will not fail as for that said $sir_gawaine$ to follow the #quest# that i am in and so made his horse to swim over the water
and anon they gat their spears and ran together full hard but $sir_gawaine$ smote him off his horse and then he turned his horse and bade him yield him
nay said the $black_knight$ not so though thou have the better of me on horseback i pray thee valiant $black_knight$ alight afoot and match we together with swords
then either dressed their shields and smote together but $sir_gawaine$ smote him so hard through the #helm# that it went to the brains and the $black_knight$ fell down dead
what is your name said $sir_gawaine$ allardin of the isles said the other ah said $gaheris$ that was a mighty #stroke# of a young $black_knight$
then $sir_gawaine$ and $gaheris$ rode more than a pace after the white hart and let slip at the hart three couple of greyhounds and so they chased the hart into a castle and in the chief place of the castle they slew the hart $sir_gawaine$ and $gaheris$ followed after
chapter vii how the hart was chased into a castle and there slain and how $sir_gawaine$ slew a #lady# right
so there came a $black_knight$ out of a chamber with a sword drawn in his hand and slew two of the greyhounds even in the sight of $sir_gawaine$ and the remnant he chased them with his sword out of the castle
and when he came again he said my white hart me repenteth that thou art dead for my sovereign #lady# gave thee to me and evil have
and anon he went into his chamber and armed him and came out fiercely and there met he with $sir_gawaine$
i kept thee and thy death shall be dear bought an i live why have #ye# slain my #hound# said $sir_gawaine$ for they did but their kind and liefer
thou sayest truth said the $black_knight$ i have avenged me on thy #hound# and so i will on thee or thou go
then $sir_gawaine$ alighted afoot and dressed his shield and struck together mightily and clave their shields and stoned their #helm# and #brake# their hauberks that the blood ran down to their feet
at the last $sir_gawaine$ smote the $black_knight$ so hard that he fell to the earth and then he cried mercy and yielded him and besought him as he was a $black_knight$ and #gentleman# to save his life
i had #ye# had wroken your anger upon me than upon a dumb beast thou shalt die said $sir_gawaine$ for slaying of my #hound#
i will make amends said the $black_knight$ unto my power $sir_gawaine$ would no mercy have but unlaced his #helm# to have stricken off his #head#
right so came his #lady# out of a chamber and fell over him and so he smote off her #head# by misadventure
alas said $gaheris$ that is foully and shamefully done that shame shall never from you also #ye# should give mercy unto them that ask mercy for a $black_knight$ without mercy is without worship
$sir_gawaine$ was so stonied of the death of this fair #lady# that he wist not what he did and said unto the $black_knight$ arise i will give thee mercy
nay nay said the $black_knight$ i take no #force# of mercy now for thou hast slain my love and my #lady# that i loved best of all earthly #thing#
me sore repenteth it said $sir_gawaine$ for i thought to strike unto thee but now thou shalt go unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and tell him of thine adventures and how thou art overcome by the $black_knight$ that went in the #quest# of the white hart
i take no #force# said the $black_knight$ whether i live or i die but so for dread of death he swore to go unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and he made him to bear one greyhound before him on his horse and another behind him
what is your name said $sir_gawaine$ or we depart my name is said the $black_knight$ ablamar of the marsh so he departed toward camelot
how four #knight# fought against $sir_gawaine$ and $gaheris$ and how they were overcome and their lives saved at request of four #lady#
and $sir_gawaine$ went into the castle and made him ready to lie there all night and would have unarmed him
chapter viii what will #ye# do said $gaheris$ will #ye# unarm you in this country #ye# may think #ye# have many #enemy# here
they had not sooner said that word but there came four #knight# well armed and assailed $sir_gawaine$ hard and said unto him thou new made $black_knight$ thou hast shamed thy knighthood for a $black_knight$ without mercy is dishonoured
also thou hast slain a fair #lady# to thy great shame to the world end and doubt thou not thou shalt have great need of mercy or thou depart from us
he fell to the earth and $gaheris$ smote him again sore and so they were on the one side and on the other that $sir_gawaine$ and $gaheris$ were in jeopardy of their lives and one with a bow an archer smote $sir_gawaine$ through the #arm# that it grieved him wonderly sore
and as they should have been slain there came four fair #lady# and besought the #knight# of grace for $sir_gawaine$ and goodly at request of the #lady# they gave $sir_gawaine$ and $gaheris$ their lives and made them to yield them as #prisoner#
and therewith one of them smote $sir_gawaine$ a great #stroke# that #nigh# then $sir_gawaine$ and $gaheris$ made great dole alas said $sir_gawaine$ mine #arm# grieveth me sore
early on the morrow there came to $sir_gawaine$ one of the four #lady# that had heard all his #complaint# and said sir $black_knight$ what #cheer#
it is your own default said the #lady# for #ye# have done a passing foul deed in the slaying of the #lady# the which will be great villainy unto you
i am like to be maimed and so made his #complaint# piteously not good said he but be #ye# not of $king_arthur_s_court$ kin said the #lady#
yes truly said $sir_gawaine$ what is your name said the #lady# #ye# must tell it me or #ye# pass my name is $sir_gawaine$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ lot of $king_lot_of_orkney$ son and my #mother# is $king_arthur_s_court$ sister
then are #ye# nephew unto $king_arthur_s_court$ said the #lady# and i shall so speak for you that #ye# shall have conduct to go to $king_arthur_s_court$ for his love
and so she departed and told the four #knight# how their #prisoner# was $king_arthur_s_court$ nephew and his name is $sir_gawaine$ $king_arthur_s_court$ lot son of $king_lot_of_orkney$
then anon they delivered $sir_gawaine$ under this promise that he should bear the dead #lady# with him in this manner the #head# of her was hanged about his #neck# and the whole body of her lay before him on his horse mane
ah and they gave him the hart #head# because it was in his #quest# right so rode he forth unto camelot
and anon as he was come $merlin_gat_excalibur$ desired of $king_arthur_s_court$ that $sir_gawaine$ should be sworn to tell of all his adventures and how he slew the #lady# and how he would give no mercy unto the $black_knight$ wherethrough the #lady# was slain
and there by ordinance of the #queen# there was set a #quest# of #lady# on $sir_gawaine$ and they judged him for ever while he lived to be with all #lady# and to fight for their quarrels and that ever he should be courteous and never to refuse mercy to him that asketh mercy
thus was $sir_gawaine$ sworn upon the four evangelists that he should never be against #lady# nor gentlewoman but if he fought for a #lady# and his adversary fought for another
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# were greatly displeased with $sir_gawaine$ for the slaying of the #lady# and thus endeth the adventure of $sir_gawaine$ that he did at the marriage of $king_arthur_s_court$
amen chapter ix how sir $tor$ rode after the $black_knight$ with the brachet and of his adventure by the #way# when sir $tor$ was ready he mounted upon his horseback and rode after the $black_knight$ with the brachet
so as he rode he met with a dwarf suddenly that smote his horse on the #head# with a staff that he went backward his spear length
why dost thou so said sir $tor$ for thou shalt not pass this #way# but if thou joust with yonder #knight# of the #pavilion#
then was $tor$ #ware# where two #pavilion# were and great spears stood out and two shields hung on trees by the #pavilion#
i may not tarry said sir $tor$ for i am in a #quest# that i must needs follow thou shalt not pass said the dwarf and therewithal
then there came one armed on horseback and dressed his shield and came fast toward $tor$ and he dressed him against him and so ran together that $tor$ bare him from his horse
he blew his horn and anon the $black_knight$ yielded him to his mercy but sir i have a fellow in yonder #pavilion# that will have ado with you anon
then was he #ware# of another $black_knight$ coming with great raundon and each of them dressed to other that #marvel# it was to see but the $black_knight$ smote sir $tor$ a great #stroke# in midst of the shield that his spear all to shivered
and sir $tor$ smote him through the shield below of the shield that it went through the cost of the $black_knight$ but the #stroke# slew him not
and therewith sir $tor$ alighted and smote him on the #helm# a great #stroke# and therewith the $black_knight$ yielded him and besought him of mercy
i will well said sir $tor$ but thou and thy fellow must go unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and yield you #prisoner# unto him
he shall be welcome said sir $tor$ by whom shall we say are we thither sent #ye# shall say by the $black_knight$ that went in the #quest# of the $black_knight$ that went with the brachet
my name is said the one sir felot of langduk and my name is said the other sir petipase of winchelsea
now what be your two names said sir $tor$ now go #ye# forth said sir $tor$ and god speed you and me
then came the dwarf and said unto sir $tor$ i pray you give me a gift i will well said sir $tor$ ask
i ask no more said the dwarf but that #ye# will suffer me to do you service for i will serve no more recreant #knight#
i wot #ye# ride after the $black_knight$ with the white brachet and i shall bring you where he is said the dwarf
and so they rode throughout a forest and at the last they were #ware# of two #pavilion# even by a priory with two shields and the one shield was enewed with white and the other shield was red
take an horse said sir $tor$ and ride on with me chapter how sir $tor$ found the brachet with a #lady# and how a $black_knight$ assailed him for the said brachet
therewith sir $tor$ alighted and took the dwarf his glaive and so he came to the white #pavilion# and saw three damosels lie in it on one pallet sleeping and
so he went to the other #pavilion# and found a #lady# lying sleeping therein but there was the white brachet that bayed at her fast and therewith the #lady# yede out of the #pavilion# and all her damosels
but anon as sir $tor$ espied the white brachet he took her by #force# and took her to the dwarf what will #ye# so said the #lady# take my brachet from me
yea said sir $tor$ this brachet have i sought from $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# hither well said the #lady# $black_knight$ #ye# shall not go far with her but that #ye# shall be met and grieved
i shall abide what adventure that cometh by the grace of god and so mounted upon his horse and passed on his #way# toward camelot but it was so near night he might not pass but little further
i know #none# said the dwarf but here beside is an hermitage and there #ye# must take lodging as #ye# find
and within a while they came to the hermitage and took lodging and was there grass oats and bread for their horses soon it was sped and full hard was their supper but there they rested them all night till on the morn and heard a mass devoutly and took their leave of the hermit and sir $tor$ prayed the hermit to pray for him
know #ye# any lodging said $tor$ he said he would and betook him to god and so mounted upon horseback and rode towards camelot a long while
with that they heard a $black_knight$ call loud that came after them and he said $black_knight$ abide and yield my brachet that thou took from my #lady#
sir $tor$ returned again and beheld him how he was a seemly $black_knight$ and well horsed and well armed at all points then sir $tor$ dressed his shield and took his spear in his hands and the other came fiercely upon him and smote both horse and man to the earth
anon they arose lightly and drew their swords as eagerly as lions and put their shields afore them and smote through the shields that the cantels fell off both parties
also they tamed their #helm# that the hot blood ran out and the thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in sunder that the hot blood ran to the earth and both they had many #wound# and were passing weary
but sir $tor$ espied that the other $black_knight$ fainted and then he sued fast upon him and doubled his #stroke# and gart him go to the earth on the one side
that will i not said abelleus while my life lasteth and the #soul# is within my body unless that thou wilt give me the brachet
that will i not do said sir $tor$ for it was my #quest# to bring again thy brachet thee or both
then sir $tor$ bade him yield him chapter xi how sir $tor$ overcame the $black_knight$ and how he lost his #head# at the request of a #lady#
with that came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ riding on a palfrey as fast as she might drive and cried with a loud voice unto sir $tor$
what will #ye# with me said sir $tor$ i beseech thee said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for $king_arthur_s_court$ love give me a gift
i require thee gentle $black_knight$ as thou art a #gentleman# now said $tor$ ask a gift and i will give it you
gramercy said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ now i ask the #head# of the false $black_knight$ abelleus for he is the most outrageous $black_knight$ that liveth and the greatest murderer
i am loath said sir $tor$ of that gift i have given you let him make amends in that he hath trespassed unto you
now said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ he may not for he slew mine own brother before mine own eyes that was a better $black_knight$ than he an he had had grace and i kneeled half an hour afore him in the mire for to save my brother life that had done him no damage but fought with him by adventure of #arm# and so for all that i could do he struck off his #head# wherefore i require thee as thou art a true $black_knight$ to give me my gift or else i shall shame thee in all the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ for he is the falsest $black_knight$ living and a great destroyer of good #knight#
i may not now said sir $tor$ but if i should be found false of my promise for while i would have taken you to mercy #ye# would #none# ask but if #ye# had the brachet again that was my #quest#
and therewith he took off his #helm# and he arose and fled and sir $tor$ after him and smote off his #head# quite
now sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ it is near night i pray you come and lodge with me here at my place it is here fast by
then when abelleus heard this he was more afeard and yielded him and asked mercy i will well said sir $tor$ for his horse
and so he rode with her and had passing good #cheer# with her and she had a passing fair old $black_knight$ to her husband that made him passing good #cheer# and well eased both his horse and him
and on the morn he heard his mass and #brake# his fast and took his leave of the $black_knight$ and of the #lady# that besought him to tell them his name
truly he said my name is sir $tor$ that was late made $black_knight$ and this was the first #quest# of #arm# that ever i did to bring again that this $black_knight$ abelleus took away from $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
o fair $black_knight$ said the #lady# and her husband an #ye# come here in our marches come and see our poor lodging and it shall be always at your commandment
so sir $tor$ departed and came to camelot on the third #day# by noon and the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# and all the #court# was passing fain of his coming and made great joy that he was come again for he went from the #court# with little succour but as $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ his father gave him an old courser and $king_arthur_s_court$ gave him armour and a sword and else had he #none# other succour but rode so forth himself alone
and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# by $merlin_gat_excalibur$ advice made him to swear to tell of his adventures and so he told and made proofs of his deeds as it is afore rehearsed wherefore the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# made great joy
nay nay said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ these be but japes to that he shall do for he shall prove a noble $black_knight$ of prowess as good as any is living and gentle and courteous and of good tatches and passing true of his promise and never shall outrage
and he had fared evil since they departed from camelot wherethrough $merlin_gat_excalibur$ words $king_arthur_s_court$ gave him an earldom of #land# that fell unto him
how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ rode after the #lady# and the $black_knight$ that led her away and how a #lady# desired #help# of him and how he fought with two #knight# for that #lady# of whom he slew the one at the first #stroke#
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ armed him and mounted upon his horse and rode more than a pace after the #lady# that the $black_knight$ led away
and as he rode in a forest he saw in a #valley# a $damosel_of_the_lake$ sit by a well and a wounded $black_knight$ in her #arm# and $king_pellinore$ saluted her
and here endeth the #quest# of sir $tor$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ son chapter xii and when she was #ware# of him she cried overloud #help# me $black_knight$ for christ sake $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$
and he would not tarry he was so eager in his #quest# and ever she cried an hundred times after #help#
when she saw he would not abide she prayed unto god to send him as much need of #help# as she had and that he might feel it or he died
so as the book telleth the $black_knight$ there died that there was wounded wherefore the #lady# for pure #sorrow# slew herself with his sword
as $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ rode in that #valley# he met with a poor man a labourer sawest thou not said $king_pellinore$ a $black_knight$ riding and leading away a #lady#
yea said the man i saw that $black_knight$ and the #lady# that made great dole and yonder beneath in a #valley# there shall #ye# see two #pavilion# and one of the #knight# of the #pavilion# challenged that #lady# of that $black_knight$ and said she was his cousin near wherefore he should lead her no farther
and so they waged battle in that quarrel the one said he would have her by #force# and the other said he would have the rule of her by #cause# he was her kinsman and would lead her to her kin
and if #ye# will ride a pace #ye# shall find them fighting and the #lady# was beleft with the two squires in the #pavilion#
for this quarrel he left them fighting god thank thee said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ then he rode a wallop till he had a sight of the two #pavilion# and the two #knight# fighting
anon he rode unto the #pavilion# and saw the #lady# that was his #quest# and said fair #lady# #ye# must go with me unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$
sir $black_knight$ said the two squires that were with her yonder are two #knight# that fight for this #lady# go thither and depart them and be agreed with them and then may #ye# have her at your pleasure
#ye# say well said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ and anon he rode betwixt them and departed them and asked them the #cause# why that they fought
sir $black_knight$ said the one i shall tell you this #lady# is my kinswoman #nigh# mine aunt daughter and when i heard her complain that she was with him maugre her #head# i waged battle to fight with him
sir $black_knight$ said the other whose name was hontzlake of wentland and this #lady# i gat by my prowess of #arm# this #day# at $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
that is untruly said said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ for #ye# came in suddenly there as we were at the high feast and took away this #lady# or any man might make him ready and therefore it was my #quest# to bring her again
therefore the #lady# shall go with me or i will die for it for i have promised it $king_arthur_s_court$
for #none# of you shall have no part of her at this time and if #ye# list to fight for her fight with me and i will defend her
and you both or else the one of us to abide in the field and therefore fight #ye# no more well said the #knight# make you ready and we shall assail you with all our power
and as $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ would have put his horse from them sir hontzlake rove his horse through with a sword and said now art thou on foot as well as we are
when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ espied that his horse was slain lightly he leapt from his horse and pulled out his sword and put his shield afore him and said $black_knight$ keep well thy #head# for thou shalt have a #buffet# for the slaying of my horse
so $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ gave him such a #stroke# upon the #helm# that he clave the #head# down to the chin that he fell to the earth dead
chapter xiii how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ gat the #lady# and brought her to camelot to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and then he turned him to the other $black_knight$ that was sore wounded
but when he saw the other #buffet# he would not fight but kneeled down and said take my cousin the #lady# with you at your request and i require you as #ye# be a true $black_knight$ put her to no shame nor villainy
what said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ will #ye# not fight for her no sir said the $black_knight$ i will not fight with such a $black_knight$ of prowess as #ye# be
i promise you she shall have no villainy by me as i am true $black_knight$ but now me lacketh an horse said $king_pellinore$ but i will have hontzlake horse
#ye# shall not need said the $black_knight$ for i shall give you such an horse as shall please you so that you will lodge with me for it is near night
and there he had with him right good #cheer# and fared of the best with passing good wine and had merry #rest# that night
and on the morn he heard a mass and dined and then was brought him a fair bay courser and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ saddle set upon him
well said $king_pellinore$ #ye# say well i will well said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ abide with you all night now what shall i call you
said the $black_knight$ inasmuch as #ye# have my cousin at your desire of your #quest# sir i shall tell you my name is $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ of the isles and $black_knight$ of the table round
now i am glad said the $black_knight$ that such a noble man shall have the rule of my cousin now what is your name
sir my name is sir meliot of logurs and this #lady# my cousin hight nimue and the $black_knight$ that was in the other #pavilion# is my sworn brother a passing good $black_knight$ and his name is $brian_de_les_isles$ of the isles and he is full loath to do wrong and full loath to fight with any man but if he be sore sought on so that for shame he may not leave it
said $king_pellinore$ i pray you tell me it is #marvel# said $king_pellinore$ that he will not have ado with me sir he will not have ado with no man
but if it be at his request bring him to the #court# said $king_pellinore$ one of these #day# sir we will come together
and #ye# shall be welcome said $king_pellinore$ to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and greatly allowed for your coming and so he departed with the #lady# and brought her to camelot
so as they rode in a #valley# it was full of stones and there the #lady# horse stumbled and threw her down that her #arm# was sore bruised and near
she swooned for pain alas sir said the #lady# mine #arm# is out of lithe wherethrough i must needs #rest# me
and so he alighted under a fair tree where was fair grass and he put his horse thereto and so laid him under the tree and slept till it was #nigh# night
#ye# shall well said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ and when he awoke he would have ridden sir said the #lady# it is so dark that #ye# may as well ride backward as forward
so they abode still and made there their lodging then sir $king_pellinore$ put off his armour then a little afore midnight they heard the trotting of an horse
be #ye# still said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ for we shall hear of some adventure chapter xiv how on the #way# he heard two #knight# as he lay by night in a #valley# and of their adventures
so right even afore him there met two #knight# the one came froward camelot and the other from the north and either saluted other
by my #head# said the other there have i been and espied the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and there is such a fellowship they may never be broken and well #nigh# all the world holdeth with $king_arthur_s_court$ for there is the flower of chivalry
now for this #cause# i am riding into the north to tell our chieftains of the fellowship that is withholden with $king_arthur_s_court$
as for that said the other $black_knight$ i have brought a remedy with me that is the greatest #poison# that ever #ye# heard speak of and to camelot will i with it for we have a friend right #nigh# $king_arthur_s_court$ and well cherished that shall #poison# $king_arthur_s_court$ for so he hath promised our chieftains and received great gifts for to do it
and therewith he armed him what tidings at camelot said the one beware said the other $black_knight$ of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for he knoweth all #thing# by the devil craft
anon after $king_pellinore$ made him ready and his #lady# and rode toward camelot and as they came by the well there as the wounded $black_knight$ was and the #lady# there he found the $black_knight$ and the #lady# eaten with lions or wild beasts all save the #head# wherefore he made great #sorrow# and wept passing sore and said alas
therefore will i not let it said the $black_knight$ and so they departed asunder her life might i have saved but i was so fierce in my #quest# therefore i would not abide
i wot not said $king_pellinore$ but my heart mourneth sore of the death of her for she was a passing fair #lady# and a young
said the #lady# take this $black_knight$ and let him be buried in an hermitage and then take the #lady# #head# and bear it with you unto $king_arthur_s_court$
so $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ took this dead $black_knight$ on his shoulders and brought him to the hermitage and charged the hermit with the corpse that service should be done for the #soul# and take his harness for your pain
wherefore make #ye# such dole said the #lady# now will #ye# do by mine advice it shall be done said the hermit as i will #answer# unto god
chapter xv how when he was come to camelot he was sworn upon a book to tell the truth of his #quest#
and therewith they departed and came there as the #head# of the #lady# lay with a fair yellow hair that grieved $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ passingly sore when he looked on it for much he cast his heart on the visage
and so by noon they came to camelot and the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# were passing fain of his coming to the #court#
and there he was made to swear upon the four evangelists to tell the truth of his #quest# from the one to the other
ah sir $king_pellinore$ said #queen# $dame_guenever$ #ye# were greatly to blame that #ye# saved not this #lady# life madam said $king_pellinore$ #ye# were greatly to blame an #ye# would not save your own life
save your pleasure i was so furious in my #quest# that i would not abide and that repenteth me and shall the #day# of my life
truly said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ #ye# ought sore to repent it for that #lady# was your own daughter begotten on the #lady# of the rule and that $black_knight$ that was dead was her love and should have wedded her and he was a right good $black_knight$ of a young man and would have proved a good man and to this #court# was he coming and his name was sir miles of the launds and a $black_knight$ came behind him and slew him with a spear and his name is loraine le $balin_le_savage$ a false $black_knight$ and a coward and she for great #sorrow# and dole slew herself with his sword and her name was eleine
and because #ye# would not abide and #help# her #ye# shall see your best friend fail you when #ye# be in the greatest distress that ever #ye# were or shall be
and that penance god hath ordained you for that deed that he that #ye# shall most trust to of any man alive he shall leave you there
an #ye# might but #ye# shall be slain me forthinketh said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ that this shall me betide but god may fordo well destiny
thus when the #quest# was done of the white hart the which followed $sir_gawaine$ and the #quest# of the brachet followed of sir $tor$ $king_pellinore$ son and the #quest# of the #lady# that the $black_knight$ took away the which $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ at that time followed then the $king_arthur_s_court$ stablished all his #knight# and them that were of #land# not rich he gave them #land# and charged them never to do outrageousity nor murder and always to flee #treason# also by no #mean# to be cruel but to give mercy unto him that asketh mercy upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship of $king_arthur_s_court$ for evermore and always to do #lady# damosels and gentlewomen succour upon pain of death
also that no man take no battles in a wrongful quarrel for no law nor for no world goods unto this were all the #knight# sworn of the table round both old and young
and every year were they sworn at the high feast of pentecost explicit the #wedding# of $king_arthur_s_court$ sequitur quartus liber
how $merlin_gat_excalibur$ was assotted and doted on one of the #lady# of the lake and how he was shut in a rock under a stone and there died
so after these #quest# of $sir_gawaine$ sir $tor$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ it fell so that $merlin_gat_excalibur$ fell in a dotage on the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ brought to #court# and she was one of the damosels of the lake that hight nimue
and ever she made $merlin_gat_excalibur$ good #cheer# till she had learned of him all manner #thing# that she desired and he was assotted upon her that he might not be from her
so on a time he told $king_arthur_s_court$ that he should not dure long but for all his crafts he should be put in the earth quick
and so he told the $king_arthur_s_court$ many #thing# that should befall but always he warned the $king_arthur_s_court$ to keep well his sword and the #scabbard# for he told him how the sword and the #scabbard# should be stolen by a woman from him that he most trusted
book iv chapter i but $merlin_gat_excalibur$ would let her have no #rest# but always he would be with her also he told $king_arthur_s_court$ that he should miss him yet
ah said the $king_arthur_s_court$ since #ye# know of your adventure purvey for it and put away by your crafts that misadventure
had #ye# liefer than all your #land# to have me again nay said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ it will not be so he departed from the $king_arthur_s_court$
and ofttimes $merlin_gat_excalibur$ would have had her privily away by his subtle crafts then she made him to swear that he should never do #none# enchantment upon her if he would have his will
and so he sware so she and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ went over the sea unto the #land# of benwick whereas $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ was $king_arthur_s_court$ that had great #war# against $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ and there $merlin_gat_excalibur$ spake with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ #wife# a fair #lady# and a good and her name was elaine and there he saw young $launcelot_du_lake$
there the #queen# made great #sorrow# for the mortal #war# that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ made on her lord and on her #land#
take #none# heaviness said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for this same child within this twenty year shall revenge you on $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$ that all christendom shall speak of it and this same child shall be the most man of worship of the world and his first name is $galahad$ that know
and within a while the $damosel_of_the_lake$ departed and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ went with her evermore wheresomever she went i well said $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and since #ye# have confirmed him $launcelot_du_lake$
that is truth said the #queen# his first name was $galahad$ $merlin_gat_excalibur$ said the #queen# shall i live to see my son such a man of prowess
and so soon after the #lady# and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ departed and by the #way# $merlin_gat_excalibur$ showed her many #wonder# and came into cornwall
and always $merlin_gat_excalibur$ lay about the #lady# to have her maidenhood and she was ever passing weary of him and fain would have been delivered of him for she was afeard of him because he was a devil son and she could not beskift him by no #mean#
and so on a time it happed that $merlin_gat_excalibur$ showed to her in a rock whereas was a great #wonder# and wrought by enchantment
yea #lady# on my peril #ye# shall see it and live many winters after that went under a great stone
so by her subtle working she made $merlin_gat_excalibur$ to go under that stone to let her #wit# of the #marvel# there but she wrought so there for him that he came never out for all the craft he could do
and so she departed and left $merlin_gat_excalibur$ chapter ii how five #king# came into this #land# to #war# against $king_arthur_s_court$ and
and as $king_arthur_s_court$ rode to camelot and held there a great feast with mirth and joy so soon after he returned unto cardoile and there came unto $king_arthur_s_court$ new tidings that the $king_arthur_s_court$ of denmark and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland that was his brother and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the vale and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of soleise and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the isle of longtains all these five #king# with a great host were entered into the #land# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and burnt and slew clean afore them both cities and castles that it was pity to hear
what counsel $king_arthur_s_court$ had against them alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ yet had i never #rest# one month since i was crowned $king_arthur_s_court$ of this #land#
now shall i never #rest# till i meet with those #king# in a fair field that i make mine avow for my true liege people shall not be destroyed in my default go with me who will and abide who that will
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let write unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ and prayed him in all haste to make him ready with such people as he might lightliest rear and hie him after in all haste
all the barons were privily wroth that the $king_arthur_s_court$ would depart so suddenly but the $king_arthur_s_court$ by no #mean# would abide but made writing unto them that were not there and bade them hie after him such as were not at that time in the #court#
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ came to #queen# $dame_guenever$ and said #lady# make you ready for #ye# shall go with me for i may not long miss you #ye# shall #cause# me to be the more hardy what adventure so befall me i will not #wit# my #lady# to be in no jeopardy
so on the morn the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# departed with such fellowship as they had and came into the north into a forest beside humber and there lodged them
when the word and tiding came unto the five #king# above said that $king_arthur_s_court$ was beside humber in a forest there was a $black_knight$ brother unto one of the five #king# that gave them this counsel
#ye# know well that sir $king_arthur_s_court$ hath the flower of chivalry of the world with him as it is proved by the great battle he did with the eleven #king# and therefore hie unto him night and #day# till
sir said she i am at your commandment and shall be ready what time so #ye# be ready that we be #nigh# him
for the longer he tarrieth the bigger he is and we ever the weaker and he is so courageous of himself that he is come to the field with little people and therefore let us set upon him or #day#
how $king_arthur_s_court$ had ado with them and overthrew them and slew the five #king# and made the remnant to flee
unto this counsel these five #king# assented and so they passed forth with their host through north wales and came upon $king_arthur_s_court$ by night and set upon his host as the $king_arthur_s_court$ and his #knight# were in their #pavilion#
and we shall slay down of his #knight# there shall #none# escape chapter iii $king_arthur_s_court$ was unarmed and had laid him to #rest# with his #queen# $dame_guenever$
sir said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ it is not good we be unarmed we shall have no need said $sir_gawaine$ and sir $griflet$ that lay in a little #pavilion# by the $king_arthur_s_court$
with that they heard a great noise and many cried #treason# treason alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ we be betrayed unto #arm# fellows then he cried
then came there a wounded $black_knight$ unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and said sir save yourself and my #lady# the #queen# for our host is destroyed and much people of ours slain
so anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# and the three #knight# took their horses and rode toward humber to pass over it and the water was so rough that they were afraid to pass over
now may #ye# choose said $king_arthur_s_court$ whether #ye# will abide and take the adventure on this side for an #ye# be taken they will slay you
it were me liefer said the #queen# to die in the water than to fall in your #enemy# hands and there be slain
and as they stood so talking sir $kay_the_seneschal$ saw the five #king# coming on horseback by themselves alone with their spears in their hands even toward them
so they were armed anon at all points lo said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ yonder be the five #king# let us go to them and match them
that were folly said $sir_gawaine$ for we are but three and they be five that is truth said sir $griflet$
no #force# said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ i will undertake for two of them and then may #ye# three undertake for the other three
and therewithal sir $kay_the_seneschal$ let his horse run as fast as he might and struck one of them through the shield and the body a fathom that the $king_arthur_s_court$ fell to the earth stark dead
and therewithal $king_arthur_s_court$ ran to another and smote him through the body with a spear that he fell to the earth dead
that saw $sir_gawaine$ and ran unto another $king_arthur_s_court$ so hard that he smote him through the body then sir $griflet$ ran unto the fourth $king_arthur_s_court$ and gave him such a fall that his #neck# #brake#
anon sir $kay_the_seneschal$ ran unto the fifth $king_arthur_s_court$ and smote him so hard on the #helm# that the #stroke# clave the #helm# and the #head# to the earth
that was well stricken said $king_arthur_s_court$ and worshipfully hast thou holden thy promise therefore i shall honour thee while that i live
and therewithal they set the #queen# in a barge into humber but always #queen# $dame_guenever$ praised sir $kay_the_seneschal$ for his deeds and said what #lady# that #ye# love and she love you not again she were greatly to blame and among #lady# said the #queen# i shall bear your noble fame for #ye# spake a great word and fulfilled it worshipfully
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the three #knight# rode into the forest for there they supposed to hear of them that were escaped and there he found the most part of his people and told them all how the five #king# were dead
and therefore let us hold us together till it be #day# and when their host have espied that their chieftains be slain they will make such dole that they shall no more #help# themselves
and right so as the $king_arthur_s_court$ said so it was for when they found the five #king# dead they made such dole that they fell from their horses
therewithal came $king_arthur_s_court$ but with a few people and slew on the left hand and on the right hand that well #nigh# there escaped no man but all were slain to the number thirty thousand
and then he sent for the #queen# and soon she was come and she made great joy of the overcoming of that battle
and therewith the #queen# departed and when the battle was all ended the $king_arthur_s_court$ kneeled down and thanked god meekly chapter iv
therewithal came one to $king_arthur_s_court$ and told him that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ was within three mile with a great host and he said go unto him and let him understand how we have sped
so within a while $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ came with a great host and saluted the people and the $king_arthur_s_court$ and there was great joy made on every side
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let search how much people of his party there was slain and there were found but little past two hundred men slain and eight #knight# of the table round in their #pavilion#
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let rear and devise in the same place whereat the battle was done a fair abbey and endowed it with great livelihood and let it call the abbey of la beale adventure
but when some of them came into their countries whereof the five #king# were #king# and told them how they were slain there was made great dole
and all $king_arthur_s_court$ #enemy# as the $king_arthur_s_court$ of north wales and the #king# of the north when they wist of the battle they were passing heavy
how the battle was finished or he came and how $king_arthur_s_court$ founded an abbey where the battle was and so the $king_arthur_s_court$ returned unto camelot in haste
and when he was come to camelot he called $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ unto him and said #ye# understand well that we have lost eight #knight# of the best of the table round and by your advice we will choose eight again of the best we may find in this #court#
sir said $king_pellinore$ i shall counsel you after my conceit the best there are in your #court# full noble #knight# both of old and young and therefore by mine advice #ye# shall choose half of the old and half of the young
sir said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ meseemeth that $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens that hath wedded your sister $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the lake and sir hervise de revel a noble $black_knight$ and sir galagars the fourth
which be the old said $king_arthur_s_court$ this is well devised said $king_arthur_s_court$ and right so shall it be now which are the four young #knight# said $king_arthur_s_court$
sir said $king_pellinore$ the first is $sir_gawaine$ your nephew that is as good a $black_knight$ of his time as any is in this #land# and
the second as meseemeth best is sir $griflet$ le fise de dieu that is a good $black_knight$ and full desirous in #arm# and who may see him live
he shall prove a good $black_knight$ and the third as meseemeth is well to be one of the #knight# of the round table sir $kay_the_seneschal$ for many times he hath done full worshipfully and now at your last battle he did full honourably for to undertake to slay two #king#
by my #head# said $king_arthur_s_court$ he is best worth to be a $black_knight$ of the round table of any that #ye# have rehearsed an he had done no more prowess in his life #day#
now said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$ i shall put to you two #knight# and #ye# shall choose which is most worthy that is sir $king_bagdemagus$ and sir $tor$ my son
but because sir $tor$ is my son i may not praise him but else an he were not my son i durst say that of his #age# there is not in this #land# a better $black_knight$ than he is nor of better conditions and loath to do any wrong and loath to take any wrong
chapter how sir $tor$ was made $black_knight$ of the round table and how $king_bagdemagus$ was displeased by my #head# said $king_arthur_s_court$ he is a passing good $black_knight$ as any #ye# spake of this #day# that wot
i well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ for i have seen him proved but he saith little and he doth much more for i know #none# in all this #court# an he were as well born on his #mother# side as he is on your side
that is like him of prowess and of might and therefore i will have him at this time and leave sir $king_bagdemagus$ till another time
so when they were so chosen by the assent of all the barons so were there found in their #siege# every #knight# names that here are rehearsed and so were they set in their #siege#
whereof sir $king_bagdemagus$ was wonderly wroth that sir $tor$ was advanced afore him and therefore suddenly he departed from the #court# and took his squire with him and rode long in a forest till they came to a cross and there alighted and said his prayers devoutly
the meanwhile his squire found written upon the cross that $king_bagdemagus$ should never return unto the #court# again till he had won a $black_knight$ body of the round table body for body
so sir said the squire here i find writing of you therefore i rede you return again to the #court#
that shall i never said $king_bagdemagus$ till men speak of me great worship and that i be worthy to be a $black_knight$ of the round table
and so he rode forth and there by the #way# he found a branch of an holy herb that was the sign of the sangreal and no $black_knight$ found such tokens
so as sir $king_bagdemagus$ rode to see many adventures it happed him to come to the rock whereas the #lady# of the lake had put $merlin_gat_excalibur$ under the stone and there he heard him make great dole whereof sir $king_bagdemagus$ would have holpen him and went unto the great stone and it was so heavy that an hundred men might not lift it up
when $merlin_gat_excalibur$ wist he was there he bade leave his labour for all was in vain for he might never be holpen but by her that put him there
and so $king_bagdemagus$ departed and did many adventures and proved after a full good $black_knight$ and came again to the #court# and was made $black_knight$ of the round table
but he were a good liver so on the morn there fell new tidings and other adventures chapter vi how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens and sir $accolon$ of gaul chased an hart and of their marvellous adventures
then it befell that $king_arthur_s_court$ and many of his #knight# rode a hunting into a great forest and it happed $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens and sir $accolon$ of gaul followed a great hart for they three were well horsed and so they chased so fast that within a while they three were then ten mile from their fellowship
and at the last they chased so sore that they slew their horses underneath them then were they all three on foot and ever they saw the hart afore them passing weary and enbushed
what will we do said $king_arthur_s_court$ we are hard bestead let us go on foot said $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens till we may meet with some lodging
then were they #ware# of the hart that lay on a great water bank and a brachet biting on his throat and more other #hound# came after
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ looked about the world and saw afore him in a great water a little ship all apparelled with silk down to the water and the ship came right unto them and landed on the sands
then $king_arthur_s_court$ blew the prise and dight the hart then $king_arthur_s_court$ went to the bank and looked in and saw #none# earthly creature therein
sirs said the $king_arthur_s_court$ come thence and let us see what is in this ship so they went in all three and found it richly behanged with #cloth# of silk
by then it was dark night and there suddenly were about them an hundred torches set upon all the sides of the ship boards and it gave great light and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and saluted $king_arthur_s_court$ on their knees and called him by his name and said he was right welcome and such #cheer# as they had he should have of the best
they led the $king_arthur_s_court$ and his two fellows into a fair chamber and there was a #cloth# laid richly beseen of all that longed unto a table and there were they served of all wines and meats that they could think of that the $king_arthur_s_court$ had great #marvel# for he fared never better in his life as for one supper
and so when they had supped at their leisure $king_arthur_s_court$ was led into a chamber a richer beseen chamber saw he never #none# and so was $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens served and led into such another chamber and sir $accolon$ was led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen and so they were laid in their #bed# easily
the $king_arthur_s_court$ thanked them fair therewithal and anon they fell asleep and slept marvellously sore all the night and on the morrow $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens was in camelot abed in his #wife# #arm# $queen_morgan_le_fay$
and when he awoke he had great #marvel# how he came there for on the even afore he was two #day# journey from camelot
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ awoke he found himself in a dark prison hearing about him many #complaint# of woful #knight# chapter vii
how $king_arthur_s_court$ took upon him to fight to be delivered out of prison and also for to deliver twenty #knight# that were in prison
we be here twenty #knight# #prisoner# said they and some of us have lain here seven year and some more and some less
we shall tell you said the #knight# this lord of this castle his name is $sir_damas$ and he is the falsest $black_knight$ that liveth and full of #treason# and a very coward as any liveth and he hath a younger brother a good $black_knight$ of prowess his name is sir $ontzlake$ and this traitor $sir_damas$ the elder brother will give him no part of his livelihood but as sir $ontzlake$ keepeth thorough prowess of his hands and so he keepeth from him
what are #ye# that so complain said $king_arthur_s_court$ for what #cause# said $king_arthur_s_court$ a full fair manor and a rich and therein sir $ontzlake$ dwelleth worshipfully and is well beloved of all people
and this $sir_damas$ our #master# is as evil beloved for he is without mercy and he is a coward and great #war# hath
been betwixt them both but $ontzlake$ hath ever the better and ever he proffereth $sir_damas$ to fight for the livelihood body for body but he will not do other else to find a $black_knight$ to fight for him
unto that $sir_damas$ had granted to find a $black_knight$ but he is so evil beloved and hated that there is never a $black_knight$ will fight for him
a $black_knight$ would fight for him he hath daily lain await with many #knight# with him and taken all the #knight# in this country to see and espy their adventures he hath taken them by #force# and brought them to his prison
and so he took us separately as we rode on our adventures and many good #knight# have died in this prison for hunger to the number of eighteen #knight# and if any of us all that here is or hath been would have foughten with his brother $ontzlake$ he would have delivered us but for because this $sir_damas$ is so false and so full of #treason# we would never fight for him to die for it
and when $sir_damas$ saw this that there was never and we be so lean for hunger that unnethe we may stand on our feet
god deliver you for his mercy said $king_arthur_s_court$ anon therewithal there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and asked him what #cheer#
sir said she an #ye# will fight for my lord #ye# shall be delivered out of prison and else #ye# escape never the life
had i liefer to fight with a $black_knight$ than to die in prison with this said $king_arthur_s_court$ i may be delivered and all these #prisoner# i will do the battle
i cannot say said he now said $king_arthur_s_court$ that is hard yet yes said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ i am ready said $king_arthur_s_court$ an
i had horse and armour #ye# shall lack #none# said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ meseemeth $damosel_of_the_lake$ i should have seen you in the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$
nay said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ i came never there i am the lord daughter of this castle yet was she false for she was one of the damosels of $queen_morgan_le_fay$
anon she went unto $sir_damas$ and told him how he would do battle for him and so he sent for $king_arthur_s_court$
and when he came he was well coloured and well made of his limbs that all #knight# that saw him said it were pity that such a $black_knight$ should die in prison
so $sir_damas$ and he were agreed that he should fight for him upon this covenant that all other #knight# should be delivered and unto that was $sir_damas$ sworn unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and also to do the battle to the uttermost
and with that all the twenty #knight# were brought out of the dark prison into the hall and delivered and so they all abode to see the battle
now turn we unto $accolon$ of gaul that when he awoke he found himself by a deep well side within half a foot in great peril of death
and there came out of that #fountain# a pipe of silver and out of that pipe ran water all on high in a stone of marble
when sir $accolon$ saw this he blessed him and said jesus save my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens for these damosels in this ship have betrayed us they were devils and no women and if i may escape this misadventure i shall destroy all where i may find these false damosels that use enchantments
right with that there came a dwarf with a great mouth and a flat nose and saluted sir $accolon$ and said how he came from $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and she greeteth you well and biddeth you be of strong heart for #ye# shall fight to morrow with a $black_knight$ at the hour of prime and therefore she hath sent you here $merlin_gat_excalibur$ $king_arthur_s_court$ sword and the #scabbard# and she biddeth you as #ye# love her that #ye# do the battle to the uttermost without any mercy like as #ye# had promised her when #ye# spake together in privity and what $damosel_of_the_lake$ that bringeth her the $black_knight$ #head# which #ye# shall fight withal she will make her a #queen#
chapter viii how $accolon$ found himself by a well and he took upon him to do battle against $king_arthur_s_court$ now i understand you well said $accolon$ i shall hold that i have promised her now
then $accolon$ took him in his #arm# and said recommend me unto my #lady# #queen# and tell her all shall be done that i have promised her and else i will die for it
i have the sword when saw #ye# my #lady# $queen_morgan_le_fay$ right late said the dwarf now i suppose said $accolon$ she hath made all these crafts and enchantments for this battle
so there came a $black_knight$ and a #lady# with six squires and saluted $accolon$ and prayed him for to arise and come and #rest# him at his manor
and so $accolon$ mounted upon a void horse and went with the $black_knight$ unto a fair manor by a priory and there he had passing good #cheer#
then $sir_damas$ sent unto his brother sir $ontzlake$ and bade make him ready by to morn at the hour of prime and to be in the field to fight with a good $black_knight$ for he had found a good $black_knight$ that was ready to do battle at all points
when this word came unto sir $ontzlake$ he was passing heavy for he was wounded a little to #fore# through both his thighs with a spear and made great dole but as he was wounded he would have taken the battle on hand
so it happed at that time by the #mean# of $queen_morgan_le_fay$ $accolon$ was with sir $ontzlake$ lodged and when he heard of that battle and how $ontzlake$ was wounded he said that he would fight for him
because $queen_morgan_le_fay$ had sent him $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and the sheath for to fight with the $black_knight$ on the morn this was the #cause# sir $accolon$ took the battle on hand
then sir $ontzlake$ was passing glad and thanked sir $accolon$ with all his heart that he would do so much for him
and therewithal sir $ontzlake$ sent word unto his brother $sir_damas$ that he had a $black_knight$ that for him should be ready in the field by the hour of prime
so on the morn sir $king_arthur_s_court$ was armed and well horsed and asked $sir_damas$ when shall we to the field
and so $king_arthur_s_court$ heard a mass and when mass was done there came a squire on a great horse and asked $sir_damas$ if his $black_knight$ were ready for our $black_knight$ is ready in the field
then sir $king_arthur_s_court$ mounted upon horseback and there were all the #knight# and commons of that country and so by all advices there were chosen twelve good men of the country for to wait upon the two #knight#
and right as $king_arthur_s_court$ was on horseback there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ from $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and brought unto sir $king_arthur_s_court$ a sword like unto $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and the #scabbard# and said unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $queen_morgan_le_fay$ sendeth here your sword for great love
and he thanked her and weened it had been so but she was false for the sword and the #scabbard# was counterfeit and brittle and false
#ye# may well believe it said the dwarf right sir said $sir_damas$ #ye# shall hear mass chapter ix of the battle between $king_arthur_s_court$ and $accolon$
and then they dressed them on both parties of the field and let their horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield with their spear #head# that both horse and man went to the earth and then they started up both and pulled out their swords
the meanwhile that they were thus at the battle came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ into the field that put $merlin_gat_excalibur$ under the stone and she came thither for love of $king_arthur_s_court$ for she knew how $queen_morgan_le_fay$ had so ordained that $king_arthur_s_court$ should have been slain that #day# and therefore she came to save his life
and so they went eagerly to the battle and gave many great #stroke# but always $king_arthur_s_court$ sword bit not like $accolon$ sword but for the most part every #stroke# that $accolon$ gave he wounded sore $king_arthur_s_court$ that it was #marvel# he stood and always his blood fell from him fast
when $king_arthur_s_court$ beheld the ground so sore be bled he was dismayed and then he deemed #treason# that his sword was changed for his sword bit not steel as it was wont to do
therefore he dreaded him sore to be dead for ever him seemed that the sword in $accolon$ hand was $merlin_gat_excalibur$ for at every #stroke# that $accolon$ struck he drew blood on $king_arthur_s_court$
now $black_knight$ said $accolon$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ keep thee well from me but $king_arthur_s_court$ answered not again and gave him such a #buffet# on the #helm# that it made him to stoop #nigh# falling down to the earth
then sir $accolon$ withdrew him a little and came on with $merlin_gat_excalibur$ on high and smote sir $king_arthur_s_court$ such a #buffet# that he fell #nigh# to the earth
then were they wroth both and gave each other many sore #stroke# but always sir $king_arthur_s_court$ lost so much blood that it was #marvel# he stood on his feet but he was so full of knighthood that knightly he endured the pain
and sir $accolon$ lost not a deal of blood therefore he waxed passing light and sir $king_arthur_s_court$ was passing feeble and weened verily to have died but for all that he made #countenance# as though he might endure and held $accolon$ as short as he might
but all men that beheld him said they saw never $black_knight$ fight so well as $king_arthur_s_court$ did considering the blood that he bled
but $accolon$ was so bold because of $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that he waxed passing hardy so was all the people sorry for him but the two brethren would not accord
then always they fought together as fierce #knight# and sir $king_arthur_s_court$ withdrew him a little for to #rest# him and sir $accolon$ called him to battle and said it is no time for me to suffer thee to #rest#
and therewith he came fiercely upon $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $king_arthur_s_court$ was wroth for the blood that he had lost and smote $accolon$ on high upon the #helm# so mightily that he made him #nigh# to fall to the earth and therewith $king_arthur_s_court$ sword brast at the cross and fell in the grass among the blood and the pommel and the sure handles he held in his hands
when sir $king_arthur_s_court$ saw that he was in great fear to die but always he held up his shield and lost no ground nor bated no #cheer#
how $king_arthur_s_court$ sword that he fought with #brake# and how he recovered of $accolon$ his own sword $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and overcame his #enemy#
then sir $accolon$ began with words of #treason# and said $black_knight$ thou art overcome and mayst not endure and also thou art weaponless and
thou hast lost much of thy blood and i am full loath to slay thee therefore yield thee to me as recreant
nay said sir $king_arthur_s_court$ i may not so for i have promised to do the battle to the uttermost by the faith of my body while me lasteth the life and therefore i had liefer to die with honour than to live with shame and if it were possible for me to die an hundred times i had liefer to die so oft than yield me to thee
for though i lack weapon i shall lack no worship and if thou slay me weaponless that shall be thy shame
well said $accolon$ as for the shame i will not spare now keep thee from me for thou art but a dead man
and therewith $accolon$ gave him such a #stroke# that he fell #nigh# to the earth and would have had $king_arthur_s_court$ to have cried him mercy
but sir $king_arthur_s_court$ pressed unto $accolon$ with his shield and gave him with the pommel in his hand such a #buffet# that he went three strides aback
when the $damosel_of_the_lake$ beheld $king_arthur_s_court$ how full of prowess his body was and the false #treason# that was wrought for him to have had him slain she had great pity that so good a $black_knight$ and such a man of worship should so be destroyed
and at the next #stroke# sir $accolon$ struck him such a #stroke# that by the $damosel_of_the_lake$ enchantment the sword $merlin_gat_excalibur$ fell out of $accolon$ hand to the earth
and therewithal sir $king_arthur_s_court$ lightly leapt to it and gat it in his hand and forthwithal he knew that it was his sword $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and said thou hast been from me all too long and much damage hast thou done me and therewith he espied the #scabbard# hanging by his side and suddenly he sterte to him and pulled the #scabbard# from him and threw it from him as far as he might throw it
o $black_knight$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ this #day# hast thou done me great damage with this sword now are #ye# come unto your death for i shall not warrant you but #ye# shall as well be rewarded with this sword or ever we depart as thou hast rewarded me for much pain have #ye# made me to endure and much blood have i lost
and therewith sir $king_arthur_s_court$ rushed on him with all his might and pulled him to the earth and then rushed off his #helm# and gave him such a #buffet# on the #head# that the blood came out at his ears his nose and his mouth
chapter now will i slay thee said $king_arthur_s_court$ slay me #ye# may well said $accolon$ an it please you for #ye# are the best $black_knight$ that ever i found and
but for i promised to do this battle said $accolon$ to the uttermost and never to be recreant while i lived therefore shall i never yield me with my mouth but god do with my body what he will
i see well that god is with you then sir $king_arthur_s_court$ remembered him and thought he should have seen this $black_knight$
now tell me said $king_arthur_s_court$ or i will slay thee of what country art thou and of what #court# sir $black_knight$ said sir $accolon$ i am of the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and my name is $accolon$ of gaul
then was $king_arthur_s_court$ more dismayed than he was beforehand for then he remembered him of his sister $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and of the enchantment of the ship
o sir $black_knight$ said he i pray you tell me who gave you this sword and by whom #ye# had it
chapter xi how $accolon$ confessed the #treason# of $queen_morgan_le_fay$ $king_arthur_s_court$ sister and how she would have done slay him
then sir $accolon$ bethought him and said woe worth this sword for by it have i got my death it may well be said the $king_arthur_s_court$
now sir said $accolon$ i will tell you this sword hath been in my keeping the most part of this twelvemonth and $queen_morgan_le_fay$ $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens #wife# sent it me yesterday by a dwarf to this intent that i should slay $king_arthur_s_court$ her brother
for #ye# shall understand $king_arthur_s_court$ is the man in the world that she most hateth because he is most of worship and of prowess of any of her blood also she loveth me out of measure as #paramour# and i her again and if she might bring about to slay $king_arthur_s_court$ by her crafts she would slay her husband $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens lightly and
then had she me devised to be $king_arthur_s_court$ in this #land# and so to reign and she to be my #queen# but that is now done said $accolon$ for i am sure of my death
well said sir $king_arthur_s_court$ i feel by you #ye# would have been $king_arthur_s_court$ in this #land# it had been great damage to have destroyed your lord said $king_arthur_s_court$
it is truth said $accolon$ but now i have told you truth wherefore i pray you tell me of whence #ye# are and of what #court#
o $accolon$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ now i let thee #wit# that i am $king_arthur_s_court$ to whom thou hast done great damage
when $accolon$ heard that he cried aloud fair sweet lord have mercy on me for i knew not you sir $accolon$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ mercy shalt thou have because i feel by thy words at this time
thou knewest not my person but i understand well by thy words that thou hast agreed to the death of my person and therefore thou art a traitor but i wite thee the less for my sister $queen_morgan_le_fay$ by her false crafts made thee to agree and consent to her false lusts but i shall be sore avenged upon her an i live that all christendom shall speak of it god knoweth i have honoured her and worshipped her more than all my kin and more have i trusted her than mine own #wife# and all my kin after
then sir $king_arthur_s_court$ called the keepers of the field and said sirs come hither for here are we two #knight# that have fought unto a great damage unto us both and like each one of us to have slain other if it had happed so and had any of us known other here had been no battle nor #stroke# stricken
then all aloud cried $accolon$ unto all the #knight# and men that were then there gathered together and said to them in this manner lords this noble $black_knight$ that i have fought withal the which me sore repenteth is the most man of prowess of manhood and of worship in the world for it is himself $king_arthur_s_court$ our alther liege lord and with mishap and with misadventure have i done this battle with the $king_arthur_s_court$ and lord that i am holden withal
chapter xii how $king_arthur_s_court$ accorded the two brethren and delivered the twenty #knight# and how sir $accolon$ died then all the people fell down on their knees and cried $king_arthur_s_court$ mercy
mercy shall #ye# have said $king_arthur_s_court$ here may #ye# see what adventures befall ofttime of errant #knight# how that i have fought with a $black_knight$ of mine own unto my great damage and his both
#ye# shall understand the opinion betwixt you two brethren as to thee $sir_damas$ for whom i have been champion and won the field of this $black_knight$ yet will i judge because #ye# $sir_damas$ are called an orgulous $black_knight$ and full of villainy and not worth of prowess your deeds therefore i will that #ye# give unto your brother all the whole manor with the appurtenance under this form that sir $ontzlake$ hold the manor of you and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon for that will become you better to ride on than upon a courser
also i charge thee $sir_damas$ upon pain of death that thou never distress no #knight# errant that ride on their adventure
and also that thou restore these twenty #knight# that thou hast long kept #prisoner# of all their harness that they be content for and if any of them come to my #court# and complain of thee by my #head# thou shalt die therefore
also sir $ontzlake$ as to you because #ye# are named a good $black_knight$ and full of prowess and true and gentle in all your deeds this shall be your charge i will give you that in all goodly haste #ye# come unto me and my #court# and #ye# shall be a $black_knight$ of mine and if your deeds be thereafter i shall so prefer you by the grace of god that #ye# shall in short time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother $sir_damas$
god thank your largeness of your goodness and of your bounty i shall be from henceforward at all times at your commandment for sir said sir $ontzlake$ as god would as i was #hurt# but late with an adventurous $black_knight$ through both my thighs that grieved me sore and else had i done this battle with you
but sirs because i am sore #hurt# and he both and i had great need of a little #rest# god would said $king_arthur_s_court$ it had been so for then had not i been #hurt# as i am
i shall tell you the #cause# why for i had not been #hurt# as i am had it not been mine own sword that was stolen from me by #treason# and this battle was ordained aforehand to have slain me and so it was brought to the purpose by false #treason# and by false enchantment
alas said sir $ontzlake$ that is great pity that ever so noble a man as #ye# are of your deeds and prowess that any man or woman might find in their hearts to work any #treason# against you
i shall reward them said $king_arthur_s_court$ in short time by the grace of god now tell me said $king_arthur_s_court$ how far am i from camelot
sir #ye# are two #day# journey therefrom i would fain be at some place of worship said sir $king_arthur_s_court$ that i might #rest# me
sir said sir $ontzlake$ hereby is a rich abbey of your elders foundation of nuns but three miles hence so the $king_arthur_s_court$ took his leave of all the people and mounted upon horseback and sir $accolon$ with him
and when they were come to the abbey he let fetch leeches and search his #wound# and $accolon$ both but sir $accolon$ died within four #day# for he had bled so much blood that he might not live but $king_arthur_s_court$ was well recovered
so when $accolon$ was dead he let send him on an horse bier with six #knight# unto camelot and said bear him to my sister $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and say that i send her him to a present and tell her i have my sword $merlin_gat_excalibur$ and the #scabbard# so they departed with the body
chapter xiii how $queen_morgan_le_fay$ would have slain sir uriens her husband and how sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ her son saved him the meanwhile $queen_morgan_le_fay$ had weened $king_arthur_s_court$ had been dead
then she called unto her a #maiden# of her counsel and said go fetch me my lord sword for i saw never better time to slay him than now
so on a #day# she espied $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens lay in his #bed# sleeping madam said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ an #ye# slay my lord
care not you said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ for now i see my time in the which it is best to do it and therefore hie thee fast and fetch me the sword
then the $damosel_of_the_lake$ departed and found sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ sleeping upon a #bed# in another chamber so she went unto sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and awaked him and bade him arise and wait on my #lady# your #mother# for she will slay the $king_arthur_s_court$ your father sleeping in his #bed# for i go to fetch his sword
anon the $damosel_of_the_lake$ brought $queen_morgan_le_fay$ the sword with quaking hands and she lightly took the sword and pulled it out and went boldly unto the #bed# side and awaited how and where she might slay him best
and as she lifted up the sword to smite sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ leapt unto his #mother# and caught her by the hand and said ah fiend what wilt thou do
#ye# can never escape well said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ go on your #way# and let me deal an thou wert not my #mother# with this sword i should smite off thy #head#
ah said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ men saith that $merlin_gat_excalibur$ was begotten of a devil but i may say an earthly devil bare me
o fair son $uwaine_les_avoutres$ have mercy upon me i was tempted with a devil wherefore i cry thee mercy i will never more do so and save my worship and discover me not
on this covenant said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ i will forgive it you so #ye# will never be about to do such deeds
how $queen_morgan_le_fay$ made great #sorrow# for the death of $accolon$ and how she stole away the #scabbard# from $king_arthur_s_court$
then came tidings unto $queen_morgan_le_fay$ that $accolon$ was dead and his body brought unto the church and how $king_arthur_s_court$ had his sword again
nay son said she and that i make you assurance chapter xiv but when $queen_morgan_le_fay$ wist that $accolon$ was dead she was so sorrowful
that near her heart to brast but because she would not it were known outward she kept her #countenance# and made no semblant of #sorrow#
but well she wist an she abode till her brother $king_arthur_s_court$ came thither there should no gold go for her life
then she went unto #queen# $dame_guenever$ and asked her leave to ride into the country #ye# may abide said #queen# $dame_guenever$ till your brother the $king_arthur_s_court$ come home
i may not said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ for i have such hasty tidings that i may not tarry well said $dame_guenever$ #ye# may depart when #ye# will
so early on the morn or it was #day# she took her horse and rode all that #day# and most part of the night and on the morn by noon she came to the same abbey of nuns whereas lay $king_arthur_s_court$ and she knowing he was there she asked where he was
and they answered how he had laid him in his #bed# to sleep for he had had but little #rest# these three nights
well said she i charge you that #none# of you awake him till i do and then she alighted off her horse and thought for to steal away $merlin_gat_excalibur$ his sword and so she went straight unto his chamber and
no man durst disobey her commandment and there she found $king_arthur_s_court$ asleep in his #bed# and $merlin_gat_excalibur$ in his right hand naked
when she saw that she was passing heavy that she might not come by the sword without she had awaked him and then she wist well she had been dead
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ awoke and missed his #scabbard# he was wroth and he asked who had been there and they said his sister $queen_morgan_le_fay$ had been there and had put the #scabbard# under her #mantle# and was gone
then she took the #scabbard# and went her #way# on horseback alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ falsely #ye# have watched me sir said they all we durst not disobey your sister commandment
ah said the $king_arthur_s_court$ let fetch the best horse may be found and bid sir $ontzlake$ #arm# him in all haste and take another good horse and ride with me
so anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ and $ontzlake$ were well armed and rode after this #lady# and so they came by a cross and found a cowherd and they asked the poor man if there came any #lady# riding that #way#
sir said this poor man right late came a #lady# riding with a forty horses and to yonder forest she rode
then they spurred their horses and followed fast and within a while $king_arthur_s_court$ had a sight of $queen_morgan_le_fay$ then he chased as fast as he might
when she espied him following her she rode a greater pace through the forest till she came to a plain and when she saw she might not escape she rode unto a lake thereby and said whatsoever come of me my brother shall not have this #scabbard#
and then she let throw the #scabbard# in the deepest of the water so it sank for it was heavy of gold and precious stones
then she rode into a #valley# where many great stones were and when she saw she must be overtaken she shaped herself horse and man by enchantment unto a great marble stone
anon withal came sir $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $ontzlake$ whereas the $king_arthur_s_court$ might know his sister and her men and one $black_knight$ from another
ah said the $king_arthur_s_court$ here may #ye# see the vengeance of god and now am i sorry that this misadventure is befallen
and then he looked for the #scabbard# but it would not be found so he returned to the abbey where he came from
so when $king_arthur_s_court$ was gone she turned all into the likeliness as she and they were before and said sirs now may we go where we will
chapter xv how $queen_morgan_le_fay$ saved a $black_knight$ that should have been drowned and how $king_arthur_s_court$ returned home again
yea said her #knight# right well and that #ye# should have found an we might have stirred from one stead for by his armyvestal #countenance# he would have caused us to have fled
anon after as she rode she met a $black_knight$ leading another $black_knight$ on his horse before him bound hand and foot blindfold to have drowned him in a #fountain#
then said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ saw #ye# $king_arthur_s_court$ my brother i believe you said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ when she saw this $black_knight$ so bound she asked him what will #ye# do with that $black_knight$
#lady# said he i will drown him for what #cause# she asked for i found him with my #wife# and she shall have the same death anon
that were pity said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ now what say #ye# $black_knight$ is it truth that he saith of you she said to the $black_knight$ that should be drowned
nay truly madam he saith not right on me of whence be #ye# said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and of what country
#ye# say well said she and for the love of him #ye# shall be delivered and #ye# shall have your adversary in the same case #ye# be in
i am of the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and my name is manassen cousin unto $accolon$ of gaul so manassen was loosed and the other $black_knight$ bound
and anon manassen unarmed him and armed himself in his harness and so mounted on horseback and the $black_knight$ afore him and so threw him into the #fountain# and drowned him
tell him that i rescued thee not for the love of him but for the love of $accolon$ and tell him i fear him not while i can make me and them that be with me in likeness of stones and let him #wit# i can do much more when i see my time
and then he rode unto $queen_morgan_le_fay$ again and asked if she would anything unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and so she departed into the country of gore and
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ had well rested him at the abbey he rode unto camelot and found his #queen# and his barons right glad of his coming
and when they heard of his strange adventures as is afore rehearsed then all had #marvel# of the falsehood of $queen_morgan_le_fay$ many #knight# wished her burnt
there was she richly received and made her castles and towns passing strong for always she dreaded much $king_arthur_s_court$ then came manassen to #court# and told the $king_arthur_s_court$ of his adventure
well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ she is a kind sister i shall so be avenged on her an i live that all christendom shall speak of it
so on the morn there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ from $queen_morgan_le_fay$ to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and she brought with her the richest #mantle# that ever was seen in that #court# for it was set as full of precious stones as one might stand by another and there were the richest stones that ever the $king_arthur_s_court$ saw
and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ said your sister sendeth you this #mantle# and desireth that #ye# should take this gift of her and in what #thing# she hath offended you she will amend it at your own pleasure
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ beheld this #mantle# it pleased him much but he said but little chapter xvi how the $damosel_of_the_lake$ saved $king_arthur_s_court$ from #mantle# that should have burnt him
with that came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and said sir i must speak with you in privity
sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ put not on you this #mantle# till #ye# have seen more and in no wise let it not come on you nor on no $black_knight$ of yours till #ye# command the bringer thereof to put it upon her
and then he said unto the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that came from his sister $damosel_of_the_lake$ this #mantle# that #ye# have brought me i will see it upon you
say on said the $king_arthur_s_court$ what #ye# will well said $king_arthur_s_court$ it shall be done as #ye# counsel me sir she said it will not beseem me to wear a $king_arthur_s_court$ garment
by my #head# said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# shall wear it or it come on my back or any man that here is
and so the $king_arthur_s_court$ made it to be put upon her and forth withal she fell down dead and never more spake word after and burnt to coals
then was the $king_arthur_s_court$ wonderly wroth more than he was to forehand and said unto $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens my sister your #wife# is alway about to betray me and well i wot
either #ye# or my nephew your son is of counsel with her to have me destroyed but as for you said the $king_arthur_s_court$ to $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens
i deem not greatly that #ye# be of her counsel for $accolon$ confessed to me by his own mouth that she would have destroyed you as well as me
therefore i hold you excused but as for your son sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ i hold him suspect therefore i charge you put him out of my #court#
and when $sir_gawaine$ wist that he made him ready to go with him and said whoso banisheth my cousin germain shall banish me
so they two departed and rode into a great forest and so they came to an abbey of monks and there were well lodged
but when the $king_arthur_s_court$ wist that $sir_gawaine$ was departed from the #court# there was made great #sorrow# among all the estates
so sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ was discharged now said $gaheris$ $sir_gawaine$ brother we have lost two good #knight# for the love of one
so on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey and so they rode forth till that they came to a great forest
then was $sir_gawaine$ #ware# in a #valley# by a turret of twelve fair damosels and two #knight# armed on great horses and the damosels went to and fro by a tree
$sir_gawaine$ #ware# how there hung a white shield on that tree and ever as the damosels came by it they spit upon it and some threw mire upon the shield
and then was chapter #xvii# how $sir_gawaine$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ met with twelve fair damosels and how they complained on sir $marhaus$
then $sir_gawaine$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ went and saluted them and asked why they did that despite to the shield sir said the damosels we shall tell you
there is a $black_knight$ in this country that owneth this white shield and he is a passing good man of his hands but he hateth all #lady# and gentlewomen and therefore we do all this despite to the shield
i shall say you said $sir_gawaine$ it beseemeth evil a good $black_knight$ to despise all #lady# and gentlewomen and peradventure though he hate you he hath some certain #cause# and peradventure he loveth in some other places #lady# and gentlewomen and to be loved again an
he be such a man of prowess as #ye# speak of now what is his name sir said they his name is $marhaus$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ son of ireland
i know him well said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ he is a passing good $black_knight$ as any is alive for i saw him once proved at a jousts where many #knight# were gathered and
ah said $sir_gawaine$ damosels methinketh #ye# are to blame for it is to suppose he that hung that shield there
he will not be long therefrom and then may those #knight# match him on horseback and that is more your worship than thus for i will abide no longer to see a $black_knight$ shield dishonoured
that time there might no man withstand him and therewith sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and $sir_gawaine$ departed a little from them and then were they #ware# where sir $marhaus$ came riding on a great horse straight toward them
and when the twelve damosels saw sir $marhaus$ they fled into the turret as they were wild so that some of them fell by the #way#
and so they ran together that the $black_knight$ #brake# his spear on $marhaus$ and $marhaus$ smote him so hard that he #brake# his #neck# and
then the one of the #knight# of the tower dressed his shield and said on high sir $marhaus$ defend thee the horse back
that saw the other $black_knight$ of the turret and dressed him toward $marhaus$ and they met so eagerly together that the $black_knight$ of the turret was soon smitten down horse and man stark dead
and then sir $marhaus$ rode unto his shield and saw how it was defouled and said of this despite i am a part avenged but for her love that gave me this white shield i shall wear thee and hang mine where thou wast and so he hanged it about his #neck#
chapter xviii how sir $marhaus$ jousted with $sir_gawaine$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and overthrew them both then he rode straight unto $sir_gawaine$ and to sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and asked them what they did there
well said sir $marhaus$ here am i ready an adventurous $black_knight$ that will fulfil any adventure that #ye# will desire and so departed from them to fetch his range
let him go said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ unto $sir_gawaine$ for he is a passing good $black_knight$ as any is living i would not by my will that any of us were matched with him
they answered him that they came from $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# to see adventures nay said $sir_gawaine$ not so it were shame to us
well said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ i will assay him afore you for i am more weaker than #ye# and if he smite me down then may #ye# revenge me
so these two #knight# came together with great raundon that sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ smote sir $marhaus$ that his spear brast in pieces on the shield and sir $marhaus$ smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth and #hurt# sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ on the left side
then sir $marhaus$ turned his horse and rode toward $sir_gawaine$ with his spear and when $sir_gawaine$ saw that he dressed his shield and they aventred their spears and they came together with all the might of their horses that either $black_knight$ smote other so hard in midst of their shields but $sir_gawaine$ spear #brake# but sir $marhaus$ spear held and therewith $sir_gawaine$ and his horse rushed down to the earth
and lightly $sir_gawaine$ rose on his feet and pulled out his sword and dressed him toward sir $marhaus$ on foot and sir $marhaus$ saw that and pulled out his sword and began to come to $sir_gawaine$ on horseback
were he not assayed were he never so good a $black_knight$ sir $black_knight$ said $sir_gawaine$ alight on foot or else i will slay thy horse
gramercy said sir $marhaus$ of your gentleness #ye# teach me courtesy for it is not for one $black_knight$ to be on foot and the other on horseback
and therewith sir $marhaus$ set his spear against a tree and alighted and tied his horse to a tree and dressed his shield and either came unto other eagerly and smote together with their swords that their shields flew in cantels and they bruised their #helm# and their hauberks and wounded either other
but $sir_gawaine$ from it passed nine of the clock waxed ever stronger and stronger for then it came to the hour of noon and thrice his might was increased
and then when it was past noon and when it drew toward evensong $sir_gawaine$ strength feebled and waxed passing faint that unnethes
all this espied sir $marhaus$ and had great #wonder# how his might increased and so they wounded other passing sore he might dure any longer and sir $marhaus$ was then bigger and bigger
sir $black_knight$ said sir $marhaus$ i have well felt that #ye# are a passing good $black_knight$ and a marvellous man of might as ever i felt any while it lasteth and our quarrels are not great and therefore it were pity to do you #hurt# for i feel #ye# are passing feeble
and therewith they took off their #helm# and either kissed other and there they swore together either to love other as brethren
ah said $sir_gawaine$ gentle $black_knight$ #ye# say the word that i should say and sir $marhaus$ prayed $sir_gawaine$ to lodge with him that night
and as they rode by the #way# sir $black_knight$ said $sir_gawaine$ i have #marvel# that so valiant a man as #ye# be love no #lady# nor damosels
and so they took their horses and rode toward sir $marhaus$ house sir said sir $marhaus$ they name me wrongfully those that give me that name
but well i wot it be the damosels of the turret that so name me and other such as they be
now shall i tell you for what #cause# i hate them for they be sorceresses and enchanters many of them and be a $black_knight$ never so good of his body and full of prowess as man may be they will make him a stark coward to have the better of him and this is the principal #cause# that i hate them and to all good #lady# and gentlewomen i owe my service as a $black_knight$ ought to do
as the book rehearseth in french there were many #knight# that overmatched $sir_gawaine$ for all the thrice might that he had sir $launcelot_du_lake$ de lake sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ sir percivale sir $pelleas$ and sir $marhaus$ these six #knight# had the better of $sir_gawaine$
then within a little while they came to sir $marhaus$ place which was in a little priory and there they alighted and #lady# and damosels unarmed them and hastily looked to their #hurt# for they were all three #hurt#
and so they had all three good lodging with sir $marhaus$ and good #cheer# for when he wist that they were $king_arthur_s_court$ sister sons he made them all the #cheer# that lay in his power and so they sojourned there a sennight and were well eased of their #wound# and at the last departed
now said sir $marhaus$ we will not depart so lightly for i will bring you through the forest and rode #day# by #day# well a seven #day# or they found any adventure
at the last they came into a great forest that was named the country and forest of arroy and the country of strange adventures
but he found strange adventures and so they rode and came into a deep #valley# full of stones and thereby they saw a fair stream of water above thereby was the #head# of the stream a fair #fountain# and three damosels sitting thereby
and then they rode to them and either saluted other and the eldest had a garland of gold about her #head# and she was three score winter of #age# or more and her hair was white under the garland
in this country said sir $marhaus$ came never $black_knight$ since it was christened the second $damosel_of_the_lake$ was of thirty winter of #age# with a circlet of gold about her #head#
the third $damosel_of_the_lake$ was but fifteen year of #age# and a garland of flowers about her #head# when these #knight# had so beheld them they asked them
we be here said the damosels for this #cause# if we may see any errant #knight# to teach them unto strange adventures and #ye# be three #knight# that seek adventures and we be three damosels and therefore each one of you must choose one of us and when #ye# have done so we will lead you unto three highways and there each of you shall choose a #way# and his $damosel_of_the_lake$ with him
and this #day# twelvemonth #ye# must meet here again and god send you your lives and thereto #ye# must plight your troth
how sir $marhaus$ $sir_gawaine$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ met three damosels and each of them took one misnumbered #xx# by $william_caxton$
the #cause# why they sat at that #fountain# this is well said said sir $marhaus$ chapter xix now shall everych of us choose a $damosel_of_the_lake$
i shall tell you said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ i am the youngest and most weakest of you both therefore i will have the eldest $damosel_of_the_lake$ for she hath seen much and can best #help# me when i have need for i have most need of #help# of you both
well said $sir_gawaine$ i thank you for #ye# have left me the youngest and the fairest and she is most liefest to me
then every $damosel_of_the_lake$ took her $black_knight$ by the reins of his bridle and brought him to the three #way# and there was their #oath# made to meet at the #fountain# that #day# twelvemonth an they were living and so they kissed and departed and each $black_knight$ set his #lady# behind him
and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ took the #way# that lay west and sir $marhaus$ took the #way# that lay south and $sir_gawaine$ took the #way# that lay north
now will we begin at $sir_gawaine$ that held that #way# till that he came unto a fair manor where dwelled an old $black_knight$ and a good householder and there $sir_gawaine$ asked the $black_knight$ if he knew any adventures in that country
now said sir $marhaus$ i will have the $damosel_of_the_lake$ of thirty winter #age# for she falleth best to me i shall show you some to morn said the old $black_knight$ and that marvellous
so on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to a laund and thereby they found a cross and as they stood and hoved there came by them the fairest $black_knight$ and the seemliest man that ever they saw making the greatest dole that ever man made
and then he was #ware# of $sir_gawaine$ and saluted him and prayed god to send him much worship as to that said $sir_gawaine$ gramercy also i pray to god that he send you honour and worship
ah said the $black_knight$ i may lay that aside for #sorrow# and shame cometh to me after worship chapter #xx# how a $black_knight$ and a dwarf strove for a #lady#
he passed unto the one side of the laund and on the other side saw $sir_gawaine$ ten #knight# that hoved still and made them ready with their shields and spears against that one $black_knight$ that came by $sir_gawaine$
then this one $black_knight$ aventred a great spear and one of the ten #knight# encountered with him but this woful $black_knight$ smote him so hard that he fell over his horse tail
so this same dolorous $black_knight$ served them all that at the leastway he smote down horse and man and all he did with one spear and so when they were all ten on foot they went to that one $black_knight$ and he stood stone still and suffered them to pull him down off his horse and bound him hand and foot and tied him under the horse belly and so led him with them
$o_jesu$ said $sir_gawaine$ this is a doleful sight to see the yonder $black_knight$ so to be entreated and it seemeth by the $black_knight$ that he suffereth them to bind him so for he maketh no resistance
and therewith no said his host that is truth for an he would they all were too weak so to do him
sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ unto $sir_gawaine$ meseemeth it were your worship to #help# that dolorous $black_knight$ for methinketh he is one of the best #knight# that ever i saw
i would do for him said $sir_gawaine$ but it seemeth he will have no #help# then said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ methinketh #ye# have no lust to #help# him
and on the other side there came a dwarf on horseback all armed save the #head# with a great mouth and a short nose and when the dwarf came #nigh# he said where is the #lady# should meet us here
thus as they talked they saw a $black_knight$ on the other side of the laund all armed save the #head# and therewithal she came forth out of the #wood#
and then they began to strive for the #lady# for the $black_knight$ said he would have her and the dwarf said he would have her
yonder is a $black_knight$ at the cross let us put it both upon him and as he deemeth so shall it be
i will well said the $black_knight$ and so they went all three unto $sir_gawaine$ and told him wherefore they strove
will we do well said the dwarf well sirs said he will #ye# put the matter in my hand yea they said both
now $damosel_of_the_lake$ said $sir_gawaine$ #ye# shall stand betwixt them both and whether #ye# list better to go to he shall have you
and when she was set between them both she left the $black_knight$ and went to the dwarf and the dwarf took her and went his #way# singing and the $black_knight$ went his #way# with great mourning
then came there two #knight# all armed and cried on high $sir_gawaine$ $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ make thee ready in all haste and joust with me
the meanwhile the other $black_knight$ went to the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and asked her why she abode with that $black_knight$ and if #ye# would abide with me i will be your faithful $black_knight$
and with you will i be said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for with $sir_gawaine$ i may not find in mine heart to be with him for now here was one $black_knight$ discomfited ten #knight# and at the last he was cowardly led away and therefore let us two go whilst they fight
so they ran together that either fell down and then on foot they drew their swords and did full actually and $sir_gawaine$ fought with that other $black_knight$ long but at the last they accorded both
so as $sir_gawaine$ went with this $black_knight$ he asked him what $black_knight$ is he in this country that smote down the ten #knight#
for when he had done so manfully he suffered them to bind him hand and foot and so led him away
ah said the $black_knight$ that is the best $black_knight$ i trow in the world and the most man of prowess and he hath been served so as he was even more than ten times and his name hight sir $pelleas$ and he loveth a great #lady# in this country and her name is $lady_ettard$
and so when he loved her there was cried in this country a great jousts three #day# and all the #knight# of this country were there and gentlewomen and who that proved him the best $black_knight$ should have a passing good sword and a circlet of gold and the circlet the $black_knight$ should give it to the fairest #lady# that was at the jousts
and this $black_knight$ sir $pelleas$ was the best $black_knight$ that was there and there were five hundred #knight# but there was never man that ever sir $pelleas$ met withal
and then the $black_knight$ prayed $sir_gawaine$ to lodge with him that night but he struck him down or else from his horse
and every #day# of three #day# he struck down twenty #knight# therefore they gave him the #prize# and forthwithal he went thereas the $lady_ettard$ was and gave her the circlet and said openly she was the fairest #lady# that there was and that would he prove upon any $black_knight$ that would say nay
how $king_arthur_s_court$ $pelleas$ suffered himself to be taken #prisoner# because he would have a sight of his #lady# and how $sir_gawaine$ promised him to get to him the love of his #lady#
and so he chose her for his sovereign #lady# and never to love other but her but she was so proud that she had scorn of him and said that she would never love him though he would die for her
wherefore all #lady# and gentlewomen had scorn of her that she was so proud for there were fairer than she and there was #none# that was there
and so this $black_knight$ promised the $lady_ettard$ to follow her into this country and never to leave her till she loved him
and thus he is here the most part #nigh# her and lodged by a priory and every week she sendeth #knight# to fight with him
and when he hath put them to the worse then will he suffer them wilfully to take him #prisoner# because he would have a sight of this #lady#
and always she doth him great despite for sometime she maketh her #knight# to tie him to his horse tail and some to bind him under the horse belly thus in the most shamefullest #way# that she can think he is brought to her
and all she doth it for to #cause# him to leave this country and to leave his loving but all this cannot make him to leave for an he would have fought on foot he might have had the better of the ten #knight# as well on foot as on horseback
alas said $sir_gawaine$ it is great pity of him and after this night i will seek him to morrow in this forest to do him all the #help# i can
so on the morn $sir_gawaine$ took his leave of his host sir $king_carados$ and rode into the forest and at the last he met with sir $pelleas$ making great moan out of measure so each of them saluted other and asked him why he made such #sorrow#
chapter xxi but an sir $pelleas$ would have proffered them love they would have loved him for his noble prowess and as it is above rehearsed sir $pelleas$ told $sir_gawaine$
but always i suffer her #knight# to fare so with me as #ye# saw yesterday in trust at the last to win her love for she knoweth well all her #knight# should not lightly win me an me list to fight with them to the uttermost
i might die so oft rather than i would suffer that despite but i trust she will have pity upon me at the last for love causeth many a good $black_knight$ to suffer to have his entent but alas i am unfortunate
wherefore an i loved her not so sore i had liefer die an hundred times an and therewith he made so great dole and #sorrow# that unnethe he might hold him on horseback
now said $sir_gawaine$ leave your mourning and i shall promise you by the faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the love of your #lady# and thereto i will plight you my troth
and then $sir_gawaine$ said i am of the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and his sister son and $king_arthur_s_court$ lot of $king_lot_of_orkney$ was my father and my name is $sir_gawaine$
and then he said my name is sir $pelleas$ born in the isles and of many isles i am lord and never have i loved #lady# nor $damosel_of_the_lake$ till now in an unhappy time and sir $black_knight$
since #ye# are so #nigh# cousin unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and a $king_arthur_s_court$ son therefore betray me not but #help# me for i may never come by her but
by some good $black_knight$ for she is in a strong castle here fast by within this four mile and over all this country she is #lady# of
ah said sir $pelleas$ of what #court# are #ye# tell me i pray you my good friend and so i may never come to her presence but as i suffer her #knight# to take me and
but if i did so that i might have a sight of her i had been dead long or this time and yet fair word had i never of her but when i am brought to #fore# her
and then they take my horse and harness and put me out of the gates and she will not suffer me to eat nor drink and always i offer me to be her #prisoner# but that she will not suffer me for i would desire no more what pains so ever i had so that i might have a sight of her daily
shall i amend an #ye# will do as i shall devise i will have your horse and your armour and so will i ride unto her castle and tell her that i have slain you and so shall i come within her to #cause# her to cherish me and
she rebuketh me in the foulest manner well said $sir_gawaine$ all this then shall i do my true part that #ye# shall not fail to have the love of her
and therewith $sir_gawaine$ plight his troth unto sir $pelleas$ to be true and faithful unto him so each one plight their troth to other and so they changed horses and harness and $sir_gawaine$ departed and came to the castle whereas stood the #pavilion# of this #lady# without the gate
chapter xxii how $sir_gawaine$ came to the $lady_ettard$ and how sir $pelleas$ found them sleeping and as soon as $lady_ettard$ had espied $sir_gawaine$ she fled in toward the castle
$sir_gawaine$ spake on high and bade her abide for he was not sir $pelleas$ i am another $black_knight$ that have slain sir $pelleas$
and so when she saw that it was not sir $pelleas$ she bade him alight and led him unto her castle and asked him faithfully whether he had slain sir $pelleas$
and he said her yea and told her his name was $sir_gawaine$ of the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and his sister son
truly said she that is great pity for he was a passing good $black_knight$ of his body but of all men alive
do off your #helm# said the $lady_ettard$ that i may see your visage i hated him most for i could never be quit of him and for #ye# have slain him
i shall be your woman and to do anything that might please you so she made $sir_gawaine$ good #cheer# then $sir_gawaine$ said that he loved a #lady# and by no #mean# she would love him
she is to blame said $lady_ettard$ an she will not love you for #ye# that be so well born a man and such a man of prowess there is no #lady# in the world too good for you
will #ye# said $sir_gawaine$ promise me to do all that #ye# may by the faith of your body to get me the love of my #lady#
yea sir said she and that i promise you by the faith of my body now said $sir_gawaine$ it is yourself that i love so well
i may not choose said the $lady_ettard$ but if i should be forsworn and so she granted him to fulfil all his desire
so it was then in the month of may that she and $sir_gawaine$ went out of the castle and supped in a #pavilion# and there was made a #bed# and there $sir_gawaine$ and the $lady_ettard$ went to #bed# together and in another #pavilion# she laid her damosels and in the third #pavilion# she laid part of her #knight# for then she had no dread of sir $pelleas$
therefore i pray you hold your promise and there $sir_gawaine$ lay with her in that #pavilion# two #day# and two nights
and on the third #day# in the morning early sir $pelleas$ armed him for he had never slept since $sir_gawaine$ departed from him for $sir_gawaine$ had promised him by the faith of his body to come to him unto his #pavilion# by that priory within the space of a #day# and a night
then sir $pelleas$ mounted upon horseback and came to the #pavilion# that stood without the castle and found in the first #pavilion# three #knight# in three #bed# and three squires lying at their feet
and then he yede to the third #pavilion# and found $sir_gawaine$ lying in #bed# with his $lady_ettard$ and either clipping other in #arm# and when he saw that his heart well #nigh# brast for #sorrow# and said alas that ever a $black_knight$ should be found so false and then he took his horse and might not abide no longer for pure #sorrow#
and when he had ridden #nigh# half a mile he turned again and thought to slay them both and when he saw them both so lie sleeping fast unnethe he might hold him on horseback for #sorrow# and said thus to himself
though this $black_knight$ be never so false i will never slay him sleeping for i will never destroy the high order of knighthood and therewith he departed again
and or he had ridden half a mile he returned again and thought then to slay them both making the greatest #sorrow# that ever man made
and when he came to the #pavilion# he tied his horse unto a tree and pulled out his sword naked in his hand and went to them thereas they lay
and yet he thought it were shame to slay them sleeping and laid the naked sword overthwart both their throats and so took his horse and rode his #way#
and when sir $pelleas$ came to his #pavilion# he told his #knight# and his squires how he had sped and said thus to them for your true and good service #ye# have done me i shall give you all my goods for i will go unto my #bed# and never arise until i am dead
and when that i am dead i charge you that #ye# take the heart out of my body and bear it her betwixt two silver dishes and tell her how i saw her lie with the false $black_knight$ $sir_gawaine$
then went he to the second #pavilion# and found four gentlewomen lying in four #bed# right so sir $pelleas$ unarmed himself and went unto his #bed# making marvellous dole and #sorrow#
when $sir_gawaine$ and $lady_ettard$ awoke of their sleep and found the naked sword overthwart their throats then she knew well it was sir $pelleas$ sword
alas said she to $sir_gawaine$ #ye# have betrayed me and sir $pelleas$ both for #ye# told me #ye# had slain him and now i know well it is not so
and if sir $pelleas$ had been as uncourteous to you as #ye# have been to him #ye# had been a dead $black_knight$ but #ye# have deceived me and betrayed me falsely that all #lady# and damosels may beware by you and me
so it happed then that the $damosel_of_the_lake$ nimue met with a $black_knight$ of sir $pelleas$ that went on his foot in the forest making great dole and she asked him the #cause#
and so the woful $black_knight$ told her how his #master# and lord was betrayed through a $black_knight$ and #lady# and how he will never arise out of his #bed# till he be dead
bring me to him said she anon and i will warrant his life he shall not die for love and she that hath caused him so to love she shall be in as evil plight as he is or
it be long to for it is no joy of such a proud #lady# that will have no mercy of such a valiant $black_knight$
anon that $black_knight$ brought her unto him and when she saw him lie in his #bed# she thought she saw never so likely a $black_knight$ and therewith she threw an enchantment upon him and he fell asleep
he is alive and therewith $sir_gawaine$ made him ready and went into the forest and therewhile she rode unto the $lady_ettard$ and charged no man to awake him till she came again
so within two hours she brought the $lady_ettard$ thither and both #lady# found him asleep lo said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# ought to be ashamed for to murder such a $black_knight$
and therewith she threw such an enchantment upon her that she loved him sore that well #nigh# she was out of her mind
o lord $o_jesu$ said the $lady_ettard$ how is it befallen unto me that i love now him that i have most hated of any man alive
and then anon sir $pelleas$ awaked and looked upon $lady_ettard$ and when he saw her he knew her and then he hated her more than any woman alive and said away traitress come never in my sight
that is the righteous judgment of god said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and when she heard him say so she wept and made great #sorrow# out of measure
chapter xxiii how sir $pelleas$ loved no more $lady_ettard$ by #mean# of the $damosel_of_the_lake$ whom he loved ever after
sir $black_knight$ $pelleas$ said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ take your horse and come forth with me out of this country and #ye# shall love a #lady# that shall love you
i will well said sir $pelleas$ for this $lady_ettard$ hath done me great despite and shame and there he told her the beginning and ending and how he had purposed never to have arisen till that he had been dead
and now such grace god hath sent me that i hate her as much as ever i loved her thanked be our lord jesus
anon sir $pelleas$ armed him and took his horse and commanded his men to bring after his #pavilion# and his stuff where the $damosel_of_the_lake$ would assign
so the $lady_ettard$ died for #sorrow# and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ rejoiced sir $pelleas$ and loved together during their life #day#
thank me said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ chapter xxiv how sir $marhaus$ rode with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and how he came to the duke of the south marches
and so they came into a deep forest and by #fortune# they were nighted and rode long in a deep #way# and at the last they came unto a courtelage and there they asked harbour
but the man of the courtelage would not lodge them for no treatise that they could treat but thus much the good man said an #ye# will take the adventure of your lodging i shall bring you where #ye# shall be lodged
now turn we unto sir $marhaus$ that rode with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ of thirty winter of #age# southward what adventure is that that i shall have for my lodging said sir $marhaus$
#ye# shall #wit# when #ye# come there said the good man sir what adventure so it be bring me thither i pray thee said sir $marhaus$ for i am weary my $damosel_of_the_lake$ and my horse
so the good man went and opened the gate and within an hour he brought him unto a fair castle and then the poor man called the porter and anon he was let into the castle and so he told the lord how he brought him a $black_knight$ errant and a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that would be lodged with him
let him in said the lord it may happen he shall repent that they took their lodging here so sir $marhaus$ was let in with torchlight and there was a goodly sight of young men that welcomed him
and then his horse was led into the stable and he and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ were brought into the hall and there stood a mighty duke and many goodly men about him
sir he said i am a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ and $black_knight$ of the table round and my name is sir $marhaus$ and born i am in ireland
then this lord asked him what he hight and from whence he came and with whom he dwelt and then said the duke to him that me sore repenteth
the #cause# is this for i love not thy lord nor #none# of thy fellows of the table round and therefore ease thyself this night as well as thou mayest for as to morn i and my six sons shall match with you
is there no remedy but that i must have ado with you and your six sons at once said sir $marhaus$
no said the duke for this #cause# i made mine avow for $sir_gawaine$ slew my seven sons in a recounter therefore i made mine avow there should never $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# lodge with me or come thereas
i might have ado with him but that i would have a revenging of my sons death what is your name said sir $marhaus$
ah said sir $marhaus$ i have heard say that #ye# have been long time a great foe unto my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ and to his #knight#
i require you tell me an it please you #wit# thou well i am the duke of south marches that shall #ye# feel to morn said the duke
yea said the duke thereof shalt thou not choose and therefore take you to your chamber and #ye# shall have all that to you longeth
shall i have ado with you said sir $marhaus$ so sir $marhaus$ departed and was led to a chamber and his $damosel_of_the_lake$ was led unto her chamber
and so sir $marhaus$ arose and armed him and then there was a mass sung afore him and #brake# his fast and so mounted on horseback in the #court# of the castle where they should do the battle
so there was the duke all ready on horseback clean armed and his six sons by him and everych had a spear in his hand and so they encountered whereas the duke and his two sons #brake# their spears upon him but sir $marhaus$ held up his spear and touched #none# of them
and on the morn the duke sent unto sir $marhaus$ and bade make him ready chapter xxv how sir $marhaus$ fought with the duke and his four sons and made them to yield them
then came the four sons by couple and two of them #brake# their spears and so did the other two and all this while sir $marhaus$ touched them not
then sir $marhaus$ ran to the duke and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth and so he served his sons and then sir $marhaus$ alighted down and bade the duke yield him or else he would slay him
and then some of his sons recovered and would have set upon sir $marhaus$ then sir $marhaus$ said to the duke
then the duke saw he might not escape the death he cried to his sons and charged them to yield them to sir $marhaus$ and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the $black_knight$ and so he received them
and then they helped up their father and so by their cominal assent promised to sir $marhaus$ never to be foes unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and thereupon at whitsuntide after to come he and his sons and put them in the $king_arthur_s_court$ grace
then sir $marhaus$ departed and within two #day# his $damosel_of_the_lake$ brought him whereas was a great #tournament# that the #lady# de vawse had cried
cease thy sons or else i will do the uttermost to you all and who that did best should have a rich circlet of gold worth a thousand besants
and there sir $marhaus$ did so nobly that he was renowned and had sometime down forty #knight# and so the circlet of gold was rewarded him
then he departed from them with great worship and so within seven nights his $damosel_of_the_lake$ brought him to an earl place his name was the earl fergus that after was sir $tristram_de_liones$ $black_knight$ and this earl was but a young man and late come into his #land# and there was a #giant# fast by him that hight taulurd and he had another brother in cornwall that hight taulas that sir $tristram_de_liones$ slew when he was out of his mind
so this earl made his #complaint# unto sir $marhaus$ that there was a #giant# by him that destroyed all his #land# and how he durst nowhere ride nor go for him
sir said the $black_knight$ whether useth he to fight on horseback or on foot nay said the earl there may no horse bear him
well said sir $marhaus$ then will i fight with him on foot so on the morn sir $marhaus$ prayed the earl that one of his men might bring him whereas the #giant# was and so he was for he saw him sit under a tree of holly and many clubs of iron and gisarms about him
so this $black_knight$ dressed him to the #giant# putting his shield afore him and the #giant# took an iron club in his hand and at the first #stroke# he clave sir $marhaus$ shield in two pieces
and there he was in great peril for the #giant# was a wily fighter but at last sir $marhaus$ smote off his right #arm# above the elbow
then the #giant# fled and the $black_knight$ after him and so he drove him into a water but the #giant# was so high that he might not wade after him
and then sir $marhaus$ made the earl fergus man to fetch him stones and with those stones the $black_knight$ gave the #giant# many sore knocks till at the last he made him fall down into the water and so was he there dead
then sir $marhaus$ went unto the #giant# castle and there he delivered twenty four #lady# and twelve #knight# out of the #giant# prison and there he had great riches without number so that the #day# of his life he was never poor man
then he returned to the earl fergus the which thanked him greatly and would have given him half his #land# but he would #none# take
so sir $marhaus$ dwelled with the earl #nigh# half a year for he was sore bruised with the #giant# and at the last he took his leave
and as he rode by the #way# he met with $sir_gawaine$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and so by adventure he met with four #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
the first was sir $sagramore$ le desirous sir osanna sir dodinas le $balin_le_savage$ and sir felot of listinoise and there sir $marhaus$ with one spear
smote down these four #knight# and #hurt# them sore so he departed to meet at his #day# aforeset chapter #xxvi# how sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ rode with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ of sixty year of #age# and how he gat the #prize# at tourneying
now turn we unto sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ that rode westward with his $damosel_of_the_lake$ of three score winter of #age# and she brought him thereas was a #tournament# #nigh# the march of wales
and at that #tournament# sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ smote down thirty #knight# therefore was given him the #prize# and that was a gerfalcon and a white steed trapped with #cloth# of gold
so then sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ did many strange adventures by the #mean# of the old $damosel_of_the_lake$ and so she brought him to a #lady# that was called the #lady# of the rock the which was much courteous
so there were in the country two #knight# that were brethren and they were called two perilous #knight# the one $black_knight$ hight sir edward of the red castle and the other sir hue of the red castle and these two brethren had disherited the #lady# of the rock of a barony of #land# by their extortion
madam said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ they are to blame for they do against the high order of knighthood and the #oath# that they made and if it like you
i will speak with them because i am a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ and i will entreat them with fairness and if they will not i shall do battle with them and in the defence of your right
and as this $black_knight$ was lodged with this #lady# she made her #complaint# to him of these two #knight# gramercy said the #lady# and thereas i may not acquit you god shall
so on the morn the two #knight# were sent for that they should come thither to speak with the #lady# of the rock and #wit# #ye#
but when this #lady# saw them in this manner so big she would not suffer sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ to go out to them upon no surety nor for no fair language but she made him speak with them over a tower but finally these two brethren would not be entreated and answered that they would keep that they had
well they failed not for they came with an hundred horse well said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ then will i fight with one of you and prove that #ye# do this #lady# wrong
that will we not said they for an we do battle we two will fight with one $black_knight$ at once and therefore if #ye# will fight so we will be ready at what hour #ye# will assign
#ye# say well said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ therefore make you ready so that #ye# be here to morn in the defence of the #lady# right
and if #ye# win us in battle the #lady# shall have her #land# again chapter xxvii how sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ fought with two #knight# and overcame them
so was there sikerness made on both parties that no #treason# should be wrought on neither party so then the #knight# departed and made them ready and that night sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ had great #cheer#
and on the morn he arose early and heard mass and #brake# his fast and so he rode unto the plain without the gates where hoved the two brethren abiding him
so they rode together passing sore that sir edward and sir hue #brake# their spears upon sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ smote sir edward that he fell over his horse and yet his spear brast not
and then he spurred his horse and came upon sir hue and overthrew him but they soon recovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and bade sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ alight and do his battle to the uttermost
then sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ devoided his horse suddenly and put his shield afore him and drew his sword and so they dressed together and either gave other such #stroke# and there these two brethren wounded sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ passing grievously that the #lady# of the rock weened he should have died
and at the last sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ smote sir edward upon the #helm# such a #stroke# that his sword carved unto his canel bone and then sir hue abated his courage but sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ pressed fast to have slain him
and thus they fought together five hours as men raged out of reason that saw sir hue he kneeled down and yielded him to sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$
and he of his gentleness received his sword and took him by the hand and went into the castle together then the #lady# of the rock was passing glad and the other brother made great #sorrow# for his brother death
then the #lady# was restored of all her #land# and sir hue was commanded to be at the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ at the next feast of pentecost
so sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ dwelt with the #lady# #nigh# half a year for it was long or he might be whole of his great #hurt#
and so when it drew #nigh# the term #day# that $sir_gawaine$ sir $marhaus$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ should meet at the cross #way# then every $black_knight$ drew him thither to hold his promise that they had made and sir $marhaus$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ brought their damosels with them but $sir_gawaine$ had lost his $damosel_of_the_lake$ as it is afore rehearsed
right so at the twelvemonths end they met all three #knight# at the #fountain# and their damosels but the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that $sir_gawaine$ had could say but little worship of him
so they departed from the damosels and rode through a great forest and there they met with a #messenger# that came from $king_arthur_s_court$
that had sought them well #nigh# a twelvemonth throughout all england wales and scotland and charged if ever he might find $sir_gawaine$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ to bring them to the #court# again
chapter xxviii how at the year end all three #knight# with their three damosels met at the #fountain# and then were they all glad and so prayed they sir $marhaus$ to ride with them to the $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
and so within twelve #day# they came to camelot and the $king_arthur_s_court$ was passing glad of their coming and so was all the #court#
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ made them to swear upon a book to tell him all their adventures that had befallen them that twelvemonth and so they did
and there was sir $marhaus$ well known for there were #knight# that he had matched aforetime and he was named one of the best #knight# living
against the feast of pentecost came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and brought with her sir $pelleas$ and at that high feast there was great jousting of #knight# and of all #knight# that were at that jousts sir $pelleas$ had the #prize# and sir $marhaus$ was named the next but sir $pelleas$ was so strong there
and at that next feast sir $pelleas$ and sir $marhaus$ were made #knight# of the table round for there were two #siege# void for two #knight# were slain that twelvemonth and great joy had $king_arthur_s_court$ of sir $pelleas$ and of sir $marhaus$
but $pelleas$ loved never after $sir_gawaine$ but as he spared him for the love of $king_arthur_s_court$ but ofttimes at jousts and #tournament# sir $pelleas$ quit $sir_gawaine$ for so it rehearseth in the book of french
so sir $tristram_de_liones$ many #day# after fought with sir $marhaus$ in an island and there they did a great battle but at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ slew him so sir $tristram_de_liones$ was wounded that unnethe he might recover and lay at a nunnery half a year
and sir $pelleas$ was a worshipful $black_knight$ and was one of the four that achieved the sangreal and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ made by her #mean# that never he had ado with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ de lake for where sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was at any jousts or any #tournament# she would not suffer him be there that #day# but if it were on the side of sir $launcelot_du_lake$
might but few #knight# sit him a #buffet# with a spear explicit liber quartus incipit liber quintus book chapter #i_#
when $king_arthur_s_court$ had after long #war# rested and held a royal feast and table round with his allies of #king# princes and noble #knight# all of the round table there came into his hall he sitting in his throne royal twelve ancient men bearing each of them a branch of olive in token that they came as ambassadors and #messenger# from the emperor $lucius_the_emperor$ which was called at that time dictator or procuror of the public weal of rome
which said #messenger# after their entering and coming into the presence of $king_arthur_s_court$ did to him their obeisance in making to him reverence and said to him in this wise the high and mighty emperor $lucius_the_emperor$ sendeth to the $king_arthur_s_court$ of britain greeting commanding thee to acknowledge him for thy lord and to send him the #truage# due of this realm unto the empire which thy father and other to #fore# thy precessors have paid as is of record and thou as rebel not knowing him as thy sovereign withholdest and retainest contrary to the statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy julius cesar conqueror of this realm and first emperor of rome
and if thou refuse his demand and commandment know thou for certain that he shall make strong #war# against thee thy realms and #land# and shall chastise thee and thy subjects that it shall be ensample perpetual unto all #king# and princes for to deny their #truage# unto that noble empire which domineth upon the universal world
then when they had showed the effect of their message the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded them to withdraw them and said he should take advice of council and give to them an #answer#
then some of the young #knight# hearing this their message would have run on them to have slain them saying that it was a #rebuke# to all the #knight# there being present to suffer them to say so to the $king_arthur_s_court$
and anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded that #none# of them upon pain of death to missay them nor do them any harm and commanded a $black_knight$ to bring them to their lodging and see that they have all that is necessary and requisite for them with the best #cheer# and that no dainty be spared for the romans be great lords and though their message please me not nor my #court# yet i must remember mine honour
after this the $king_arthur_s_court$ let call all his lords and #knight# of the round table to counsel upon this matter and desired them to say their advice
how twelve aged ambassadors of rome came to $king_arthur_s_court$ to demand #truage# for britain then sir cador of cornwall spake first and said sir this message liketh me well
for we have many #day# rested us and have been idle and now i hope #ye# shall make sharp #war# on the romans where i doubt not we shall get honour
i believe well said $king_arthur_s_court$ that this matter pleaseth thee well but these #answer# may not be answered for the demand grieveth me sore for truly i will never pay #truage# to rome wherefore i pray you to counsel me
i have understood that belinus and brenius #king# of britain have had the empire in their hands many #day# and also constantine the son of heleine which is an open evidence that we owe no tribute to rome but of right
we that be descended of them have right to claim the title of the empire chapter ii how the #king# and lords promised to $king_arthur_s_court$ aid and #help# against the romans
then answered $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of scotland sir #ye# ought of right to be above all other #king# for unto you is #none# like nor pareil in christendom of knighthood nor of dignity and i counsel you never to obey the romans for when they reigned on us they distressed our elders and put this #land# to great extortions and tallies wherefore i make here mine avow to avenge me on them and for to strengthen your quarrel i shall furnish twenty thousand good men of #war# and wage them on my costs which shall await on you with myself when it shall please you
and then every man agreed to make #war# and to aid after their power that is to #wit# the lord of west wales promised to bring thirty thousand men and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ sir ider his son with their cousins promised to bring thirty thousand
and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of little britain granted him to the same thirty thousand wherefore $king_arthur_s_court$ thanked them then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ with all other promised in likewise every man a great multitude
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ understood their courages and good wills he thanked them heartily and after let call the ambassadors to hear their #answer#
and in presence of all his lords and #knight# he said to them in this wise i will that #ye# return unto your lord and procuror of the common weal for the romans and say #ye# to him of his demand and commandment i set nothing and that i know of no #truage# nor tribute that i owe to him nor to #none# earthly prince christian nor heathen but i pretend to have and occupy the sovereignty of the empire wherein i am entitled by the right of my predecessors sometime #king# of this #land# and say to him that i am delibered and fully concluded to go with mine army with strength and power unto rome by the grace of god to take possession in the empire and subdue them that be rebel
wherefore i command him and all them of rome that incontinent they make to me their homage and to acknowledge me for their emperor and governor upon pain that shall ensue
and then he commanded his treasurer to give to them great and large gifts and to pay all their dispenses and assigned sir cador to convey them out of the #land#
and so they took their leave and departed and took their shipping at sandwich and passed forth by flanders almaine the mountains and all italy until they came unto $lucius_the_emperor$
when the emperor $lucius_the_emperor$ had well understood their credence he was sore moved as he had been all araged and said i had supposed that $king_arthur_s_court$ would have obeyed to my commandment and have served you himself as him well beseemed or any other $king_arthur_s_court$ to do
o sir said one of the #senator# let be such vain words for we let you #wit# that i and my fellows were full sore afeard to behold his #countenance#
i fear me #ye# have made a rod for yourself for he intendeth to be lord of this empire which sore is to be doubted
if he come for he is all another man than #ye# ween and holdeth the most noble #court# of the world all other #king# nor princes may not compare unto his noble maintenance
on new year #day# we saw him in his estate which was the royalest that ever we saw for he was served at his table with nine #king# and the noblest fellowship of other princes lords and #knight# that be in the world and every $black_knight$ approved and like a lord and holdeth table round and in his person the most manly man that liveth and is like to conquer all the world for unto his courage it is too little
wherefore i advise you to keep well your marches and straits in the mountains for certainly he is a lord to be doubted
well said $lucius_the_emperor$ before easter i suppose to pass the mountains and so forth into france and there bereave him his #land# with genoese and other mighty warriors of tuscany and lombardy
and i shall send for them all that be subjects and allied to the empire of rome to come to mine aid
and forthwith sent old wise #knight# unto these countries following first to ambage and arrage to alexandria to india to armenia whereas the river of euphrates runneth into asia to africa and europe the large to ertayne and elamye to araby egypt and to damascus to damietta and cayer to cappadocia to tarsus turkey pontus and pamphylia to syria and galatia
and all these were subject to rome and many more as greece cyprus macedonia calabria cateland portugal with many thousands of spaniards
and after the reverence made they made relation of their #answer# like as #ye# to #fore# have heard thus all these #king# dukes and admirals assembled about rome with sixteen #king# at once with great multitude of people
also he had gotten with him fifty #giant# which had been engendered of fiends and they were ordained to guard his person and to break the front of the battle of $king_arthur_s_court$
and thus departed from rome and came down the mountains for to destroy the #land# that $king_arthur_s_court$ had conquered and came unto cologne and besieged a castle thereby and won it soon and stuffed it with two hundred saracens or infidels and after destroyed many fair countries which $king_arthur_s_court$ had won of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_claudas$
and thus $lucius_the_emperor$ came with all his host which were disperplyd sixty mile in breadth and commanded them to meet with him in burgoyne for he purposed to destroy the realm of little britain
when the emperor understood their coming he made ready his romans and all the people between him and flanders chapter iii
now leave we of $lucius_the_emperor$ and speak we of $king_arthur_s_court$ that commanded all them of his retinue to be ready at the utas of hilary for to hold a parliament at york
and at that parliament was concluded to arrest all the navy of the #land# and to be ready within fifteen #day# at sandwich and there he showed to his army how he purposed to conquer the empire which he ought to have of right
and there he ordained two governors of this realm that is to say sir baudwin of britain for to counsel to the best and sir constantine son to sir cador of cornwall which after the death of $king_arthur_s_court$ was $king_arthur_s_court$ of this realm
and in the presence of all his lords he resigned the rule of the realm and $dame_guenever$ his #queen# to them wherefore sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was wroth for he left sir $tristram_de_liones$ with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ for the love of beale isould
then the #queen# $dame_guenever$ made great #sorrow# for the #departing# of her lord and other and swooned in such wise that the #lady# bare her into her chamber
thus the $king_arthur_s_court$ with his great army departed leaving the #queen# and realm in the governance of sir baudwin and constantine
how $king_arthur_s_court$ held a parliament at york and how he ordained the realm should be governed in his absence and when he was on his horse he said with an high voice
if i die in this journey i will that sir constantine be mine heir and $king_arthur_s_court$ crowned of this realm as next of my blood
and after departed and entered into the sea at sandwich with all his army with a great multitude of ships galleys cogs and dromounds sailing on the sea
chapter iv how $king_arthur_s_court$ being shipped and lying in his cabin had a marvellous #dream# and of the exposition thereof
and as the $king_arthur_s_court$ lay in his cabin in the ship he fell in a slumbering and dreamed a marvellous #dream# him seemed that a dreadful dragon did drown much of his people and he came flying out of the west and his #head# was enamelled with azure and his shoulders shone as gold his belly like mails of a marvellous hue his tail full of tatters his feet full of fine sable and his claws like fine gold and an hideous flame of fire flew out of his mouth like as the #land# and water had flamed all of fire
after him seemed there came out of the orient a grimly boar all black in a cloud and his paws as big as a post he was rugged looking roughly he was the foulest beast that ever man saw he roared and romed so hideously that it were #marvel# to hear
then the dreadful dragon advanced him and came in the wind like a falcon giving great #stroke# on the boar and the boar hit him again with his grizzly tusks that his breast was all bloody and that the hot blood made all the sea red of his blood
then the dragon flew away all on an height and came down with such a swough and smote the boar on the ridge which was ten foot large from the #head# to the tail and smote the boar all to powder both flesh and bones that it flittered all abroad on the sea
and therewith the $king_arthur_s_court$ awoke anon and was sore abashed of this #dream# and sent anon for a wise philosopher commanding to tell him the signification of his #dream#
sir said the philosopher the dragon that thou dreamedst of betokeneth thine own person that sailest here and the colours of his wings be thy realms that thou hast won and his tail which is all to tattered signifieth the noble #knight# of the round table and the boar that the dragon slew coming from the clouds betokeneth some tyrant that tormenteth the people or else thou art like to fight with some #giant# thyself being horrible and abominable whose peer #ye# saw never in your #day#
then after this soon they had sight of #land# and sailed till they arrived at barflete in flanders and when they were there he found many of his great lords ready as they had been commanded to wait upon him
wherefore of this dreadful #dream# doubt thee nothing but as a conqueror come forth thyself chapter how a man of the country told to him of a marvellous #giant# and how he fought and conquered him
then came to him an husbandman of the country and told him how there was in the country of constantine beside brittany a great #giant# which had slain murdered and devoured much people of the country and had been sustained seven year with the children of the commons of that #land# insomuch that all the children be all slain and destroyed and now late he hath taken the duchess of brittany as she rode with her meiny and hath led her to his lodging which is in a mountain for to ravish and lie by her to her life end and many people followed her more than five hundred but
all they might not rescue her but they left her shrieking and crying lamentably wherefore i suppose that he hath slain her in fulfilling his foul lust of lechery
now as thou art a rightful $king_arthur_s_court$ have pity on this #lady# and revenge us all as thou art a noble conqueror
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ this is a great mischief i had liefer than the best realm that i have that i had been
she was #wife# unto thy cousin sir howell whom we call full #nigh# of thy blood a furlong #way# to #fore# him for to have rescued that #lady#
now fellow said $king_arthur_s_court$ canst thou bring me thereas this #giant# haunteth yea sir said the good man look yonder whereas thou seest those two great fires there shalt
thou find him and more treasure than i suppose is in all france when the $king_arthur_s_court$ had understood this piteous case he returned into his tent
then he called to him sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir bedivere and commanded them secretly to make ready horse and harness for himself and them twain for after evensong he would ride on pilgrimage with them two only unto saint michael mount
and so they three departed thence and rode forth as fast as ever they might till that they came to the foreland of that mount
and there they alighted and the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded them to tarry there for he would himself go up into that mount
and so he ascended up into that hill till he came to a great fire and there he found a careful widow wringing her hands and making great #sorrow# sitting by a grave new made
and then anon he made him ready and armed him at all points and took his horse and his shield and then $king_arthur_s_court$ saluted her and demanded of her wherefore
she made such lamentation to whom she answered and said sir $black_knight$ speak soft for yonder is a devil if he hear thee speak he will come and destroy thee i hold thee unhappy what dost thou here in this mountain
for if #ye# were such fifty as #ye# be #ye# were not able to make resistance against this devil here lieth a duchess dead the which was the fairest of all the world #wife# to sir howell duke of brittany he hath murdered her in forcing her and hath slit her unto the navel
dame said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i come from the noble conqueror $king_arthur_s_court$ for to treat with that tyrant for his liege people
fie on such treaties said she he setteth not by the $king_arthur_s_court$ nor by no man else but an if thou have brought $king_arthur_s_court$ #wife# $dame_guenever$ he shall be gladder than thou hadst given to him half france
beware approach him not too #nigh# for he hath vanquished fifteen #king# and hath made him a coat full of precious stones embroidered with their beards which they sent him to have his love for salvation of their people at this last christmas
well said $king_arthur_s_court$ i will accomplish my message for all your fearful words and went forth by the crest of that hill and saw where he sat at supper gnawing on a limb of a man baking his broad limbs by the fire and breechless and three fair damosels turning three broaches whereon were broached twelve young children late born like young birds
when $king_arthur_s_court$ beheld that piteous sight he had great compassion on them so that his heart bled for #sorrow# and hailed him saying in this wise
he that all the world wieldeth give thee short life and shameful death and the devil have thy #soul# why hast thou murdered these young innocent children and murdered this duchess
and if thou wilt speak with him at yonder great fire at supper therefore arise and dress thee thou glutton for this #day# shalt thou die of my hand
then the glutton anon started up and took a great club in his hand and smote at the $king_arthur_s_court$ that his coronal fell to the earth
and the $king_arthur_s_court$ hit him again that he carved his belly and cut off his genitours that his guts and his entrails fell down to the ground
then the #giant# threw away his club and caught the $king_arthur_s_court$ in his #arm# that he crushed his ribs then the three #maiden# kneeled down and called to christ for #help# and comfort of $king_arthur_s_court$
and so weltering and wallowing they rolled down the hill till they came to the sea $king_mark$ and ever as they so weltered $king_arthur_s_court$ smote him with his dagger
and it fortuned they came to the place whereas the two #knight# were and kept $king_arthur_s_court$ horse then when they saw the $king_arthur_s_court$ fast in the #giant# #arm# they came and loosed him
and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded sir $kay_the_seneschal$ to smite off the #giant# #head# and to set it upon a truncheon of a spear and bear it to sir howell and tell him that his #enemy# was slain and after let this #head# be bound to a barbican that all the people may see and behold it and go #ye# two up to the mountain and fetch me my shield my sword and the club of iron and as for the treasure take #ye# it for #ye# shall find there goods out of number so i have the kirtle and the club
this was the fiercest #giant# that ever i met with save one in the mount of araby which i overcame but this was greater and fiercer
then the #knight# fetched the club and the kirtle and some of the treasure they took to themselves and returned again to the host
and then $king_arthur_s_court$ weltered and wrung that he was other while under and another time above i desire no more and anon this was known through all the country wherefore the people came and thanked the $king_arthur_s_court$
and after that $king_arthur_s_court$ said and commanded his cousin howell that he should ordain for a church to be builded on the same hill in the worship of saint michael
and on the morn the $king_arthur_s_court$ removed with his great battle and came into champayne and in a #valley# and there they pight their tents and the $king_arthur_s_court$ being set at his dinner there came in two #messenger# of whom that one was marshal of france and said to the $king_arthur_s_court$ that the emperor was entered into france and had destroyed a great part and was in burgoyne and had destroyed and made great slaughter of people and burnt towns and boroughs wherefore if thou come not hastily they must yield up their bodies and goods
and he said again give the thanks to god and depart the goods among you chapter vi how $king_arthur_s_court$ sent $sir_gawaine$ and other to $lucius_the_emperor$ and how they were assailed and escaped with worship
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ did do call $sir_gawaine$ sir $bors_de_ganis$ sir $lionel$ and sir bedivere and commanded them to go straight to sir $lucius_the_emperor$ and say #ye# to him that hastily he remove out of my #land# and if he will not bid him make him ready to battle and not distress the poor people
then anon these noble #knight# dressed them to horseback and when they came to the green #wood# they saw many #pavilion# set in a meadow of silk of #diver# colours beside a river and the emperor #pavilion# was in the middle with an eagle displayed above
to the which tent our #knight# rode toward and ordained $sir_gawaine$ and sir $bors_de_ganis$ to do the message and left in a bushment sir $lionel$ and sir bedivere
and then $sir_gawaine$ and sir $bors_de_ganis$ did their message and commanded $lucius_the_emperor$ in $king_arthur_s_court$ name to avoid his #land# or shortly to address him to battle
to whom $lucius_the_emperor$ answered and said #ye# shall return to your lord and say #ye# to him that i shall subdue him and all his #land#
then $sir_gawaine$ was wroth and said i had liefer than all france fight against thee and so had i said sir $bors_de_ganis$ liefer than all brittany or burgoyne
then a $black_knight$ named sir gainus #nigh# cousin to the emperor said lo how these britons be full of pride and boast and they brag as though they bare up all the world
and therewith turned their horses and rode over waters and through #wood# till they came to their bushment whereas sir $lionel$ and sir bedivere were hoving
the romans followed fast after on horseback and on foot over a champaign unto a #wood# then sir $bors_de_ganis$ turned his horse and saw a $black_knight$ come fast on whom he smote through the body with a spear that he fell dead down to the earth then came caliburn one of the strongest of pavie and smote down many of $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight#
and when sir $bors_de_ganis$ saw him do so much harm he addressed toward him and smote him through the breast that he fell down dead to the earth
then sir feldenak thought to revenge the death of gainus upon $sir_gawaine$ but $sir_gawaine$ was #ware# thereof and smote him on the #head# which #stroke# stinted not till it came to his breast
then $sir_gawaine$ was sore grieved with these words and pulled out his sword and smote off his #head# and then he returned and came to his fellows in the bushment
and there was a recounter for the bushment #brake# on the romans and slew and hew down the romans and forced the romans to flee and return whom the noble #knight# chased unto their tents
then the romans gathered more people and also footmen came on and there was a new battle and so much people that sir $bors_de_ganis$ and sir berel were taken
but when $sir_gawaine$ saw that he took with him sir idrus the good $black_knight$ and said he would never see $king_arthur_s_court$
but if he rescued them and pulled out galatine his good sword and followed them that led those two #knight# away and he smote him that led sir $bors_de_ganis$ and took sir $bors_de_ganis$ from him and delivered him to his fellows
then began the battle to be great that our #knight# were in great jeopardy wherefore $sir_gawaine$ sent to $king_arthur_s_court$ for succour and that he hie him for i am sore wounded and that our #prisoner# may pay goods out of number
and anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ did do assemble his army but anon or he departed the #prisoner# were come and $sir_gawaine$ and his fellows gat the field and put the romans to flight and after returned and came with their fellowship in such wise that no man of worship was lost of them save that $sir_gawaine$ was sore #hurt#
and sir idrus in likewise rescued sir berel and the #messenger# came to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and told him his message then the $king_arthur_s_court$ did do ransack his #wound# and comforted him
and thus was the beginning of the first journey of the britons and romans and there were slain of the romans more than ten thousand and great joy and mirth was made that night in the host of $king_arthur_s_court$
and on the morn he sent all the #prisoner# into paris under the guard of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ with many #knight# and of sir cador
how $lucius_the_emperor$ sent certain spies in a bushment for to have taken his #knight# being #prisoner# and how they were letted
now turn we to the emperor of rome which espied that these #prisoner# should be sent to paris and anon he sent to lie in a bushment certain #knight# and princes with sixty thousand men for to rescue his #knight# and lords that were #prisoner#
and so on the morn as $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir cador chieftains and governors of all them that conveyed the #prisoner# as they should pass through a #wood# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sent certain #knight# to espy if any were in the #wood# to let them
and when the said #knight# came into the #wood# anon they espied and saw the great embushment and returned and told sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that there lay in await for them three score thousand romans
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ with such #knight# as he had and men of #war# to the number of ten thousand put them in array and met with them and fought with them manly and slew and detrenched many of the romans and slew many #knight# and admirals of the party of the romans and saracens there was slain the $king_arthur_s_court$ of lyly and three great lords aladuke herawd and heringdale
but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ fought so nobly that no man might endure a #stroke# of his hand but where he came he showed his prowess and might for he slew down right on every side and the romans and saracens fled from him as the sheep from the wolf or from the lion and put them all that abode alive to flight
and so long they fought that tidings came to $king_arthur_s_court$ and anon he graithed him and came to the battle and saw his #knight# how they had vanquished the battle
he embraced them $black_knight$ by $black_knight$ in his #arm# and said #ye# be worthy to wield all your honour and worship there was never $king_arthur_s_court$ save myself that had so noble #knight#
sir said cador there was #none# of us failed other but of the prowess and manhood of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ were more than #wonder# to tell and also of his cousins which did that #day# many noble #feat# of #war#
and also sir cador told who of his #knight# were slain as sir berel and other sir moris and sir maurel two good #knight#
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ wept and dried his eyes with a kerchief and said your courage had near hand destroyed you for though #ye# had returned again #ye# had lost no worship for i call it folly #knight# to abide when they be overmatched
chapter vii nay said $launcelot_du_lake$ and the other for once shamed may never be recovered chapter viii how a #senator# told to $lucius_the_emperor$ of their discomfiture and also of the great battle between $king_arthur_s_court$ and $lucius_the_emperor$
now leave we $king_arthur_s_court$ and his noble #knight# which had won the field and had brought their #prisoner# to paris and speak we of a #senator# which escaped from the battle and came to $lucius_the_emperor$ and said to him sir emperor i advise thee for to withdraw thee what dost thou here
thou shalt win nothing in these marches but great #stroke# out of all measure for this #day# one of $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight# was worth in the battle an hundred of ours
fie on thee said $lucius_the_emperor$ thou speakest cowardly for thy words grieve me more than all the loss that i had this #day#
and anon he sent forth a $king_arthur_s_court$ which hight sir leomie with a great army and bade him hie him fast to #fore# and he would follow hastily after
$king_arthur_s_court$ was warned privily and sent his people to sessoine and took up the towns and castles from the romans
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded sir cador to take the rearward and to take with him certain #knight# of the round table and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir $bors_de_ganis$ sir $kay_the_seneschal$ sir marrok with sir $marhaus$ shall await on our person
when the emperor was entered into the vale of sessoine he might see where $king_arthur_s_court$ was embattled and his banner displayed and he was beset round about with his #enemy# that needs he must fight or yield him for he might not flee but said openly unto the romans sirs i admonish you that this #day# #ye# fight and acquit you as men and remember how rome domineth and is chief and #head# over all the earth and universal world and suffer not these britons this #day# to abide against us and therewith he did command his trumpets to blow the bloody sounds in such wise that the ground trembled and dindled
then the battles approached and shoved and shouted on both sides and great #stroke# were smitten on both sides many men overthrown #hurt# and slain and great valiances prowesses and appertices of #war# were that #day# showed which were over long to recount the noble #feat# of every man for they should contain an whole volume
but in especial $king_arthur_s_court$ rode in the battle exhorting his #knight# to do well and himself did as nobly with his hands as was possible a man to do he drew out $merlin_gat_excalibur$ his sword and awaited ever whereas the romans were thickest and most grieved his people and anon he addressed him on that part and hew and slew down right and rescued his people and he slew a great #giant# named galapas which was a man of an huge quantity and height he shorted him and smote off both his legs by the knees saying now art thou better of a size to deal with than thou were and after smote off his #head#
thus the $king_arthur_s_court$ disperpled his host in #diver# parties to the end that his #enemy# should not escape there $sir_gawaine$ fought nobly and slew three admirals in that battle
and so did all the #knight# of the round table thus the battle between $king_arthur_s_court$ and $lucius_the_emperor$ endured long
and thus the battle was great and oftsides that one party was at a fordeal and anon at an afterdeal which endured so long till at the last $king_arthur_s_court$ espied where $lucius_the_emperor$ fought and did #wonder# with his own hands
$lucius_the_emperor$ had on his side many saracens which were slain and anon he rode to him and either smote other fiercely and at last $lucius_the_emperor$ smote $king_arthur_s_court$ thwart the visage and gave him a large #wound#
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ felt himself #hurt# anon he smote him again with $merlin_gat_excalibur$ that it cleft his #head# from the summit of his #head# and stinted not till it came to his breast
and when it was known that the emperor was slain anon all the romans with all their host put them to flight and $king_arthur_s_court$ with all his #knight# followed the chase and slew down right all them that they might attain
and thus was the victory given to $king_arthur_s_court$ and the triumph and there were slain on the part of $lucius_the_emperor$ more than an hundred thousand
and after $king_arthur_s_court$ did do ransack the dead bodies and did do bury them that were slain of his retinue
and then the emperor fell down dead and there ended his life every man according to the estate and degree that he was of
and them that were #hurt# he let the surgeons do search their #hurt# and #wound# and commanded to spare no salves nor medicines till they were whole
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ rode straight to the place where the emperor $lucius_the_emperor$ lay dead and with him he found slain the soudan of syria the $king_arthur_s_court$ of egypt and of ethiopia which were two noble #king# with seventeen other #king# of #diver# regions and also sixty #senator# of rome all noble men whom the $king_arthur_s_court$ did do balm and gum with many good gums aromatic and after did do cere them in sixty fold of cered #cloth# of sendal and laid them in chests of lead because they should not chafe nor savour and upon all these bodies their shields with their #arm# and banners were set to the end they should be known of what country they were
and after he found three #senator# which were alive to whom he said for to save your lives i will that #ye# take these dead bodies and carry them with you unto great rome and present them to the potestate on my behalf shewing him my letters and tell them that i in my person shall hastily be at rome
and i suppose the romans shall beware how they shall demand any tribute of me and i command you to say
when #ye# shall come to rome to the potestate and all the council and senate that i send to them these dead bodies for the tribute that they have demanded
and if they be not content with these i shall pay more at my coming for other tribute owe i #none# nor #none# other will i pay
and furthermore i charge you to say to them that i command them upon pain of their #head# never to demand tribute nor tax of me nor of my #land#
then with this charge and commandment the three #senator# aforesaid departed with all the said dead bodies laying the body of $lucius_the_emperor$ in a car covered with the #arm# of the empire all alone and after alway two bodies of #king# in a chariot and then the bodies of the #senator# after them and so went toward rome and showed their legation and message to the potestate and senate recounting the battle done in france and how the field was lost and much people and innumerable slain
wherefore they advised them in no wise to move no more #war# against that noble conqueror $king_arthur_s_court$ for his might and prowess is most to be doubted seen the noble #king# and great multitude of #knight# of the round table to whom #none# earthly prince may compare
and methinketh this sufficeth for britain ireland and all almaine with germany chapter ix how $king_arthur_s_court$ after he had achieved the battle against the romans entered into almaine and so into italy
now turn we unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and his noble #knight# which after the great battle achieved against the romans entered into lorraine brabant and flanders and sithen returned into haut almaine and so over the mountains into lombardy and after into tuscany wherein was a city which in no wise would yield themself nor obey wherefore $king_arthur_s_court$ besieged it and lay long about it and gave many assaults to the city and they within defended them valiantly
then on a time the $king_arthur_s_court$ called sir florence a $black_knight$ and said to him they lacked victual and not far from hence be great forests and #wood# wherein be many of mine #enemy# with much bestial
i will that thou make thee ready and go thither in foraying and take with thee $sir_gawaine$ my nephew sir wisshard sir clegis sir cleremond and the captain of cardiff with other and bring with you all the beasts that #ye# there can get
these #knight# made them ready and rode over holts and hills through forests and #wood# till they came into a fair meadow full of fair flowers and grass and there they rested them and their horses all that night
and in the springing of the #day# in the next morn $sir_gawaine$ took his horse and stole away from his fellowship to seek some adventures
and anon he was #ware# of a man armed walking his horse easily by a #wood# side and his shield laced to his shoulder sitting on a strong courser without any man saving a #page# bearing a mighty spear
when $sir_gawaine$ espied this gay $black_knight$ he feutred his spear and rode straight to him and demanded of him from whence that he was
that other answered and said he was of tuscany and demanded of $sir_gawaine$ what profferest thou proud $black_knight$ thee so boldly
and anon the $black_knight$ bare in his shield three griffins of gold in sable carbuncle the chief of silver here gettest thou no prey
then said $sir_gawaine$ thou avauntest thee greatly and speakest proud words i counsel thee for all thy boast that thou make thee ready and take thy gear to thee to #fore# greater grame fall to thee
thou mayest prove what thou wilt for thou shalt be my #prisoner# or thou depart chapter of a battle done by $sir_gawaine$ against a $palamides_the_saracen$ which after was yielden and became christian
then they took their spears and ran each at other with all the might they had and smote each other through their shields into their shoulders wherefore anon they pulled out their swords and smote great #stroke# that the fire sprang out of their #helm#
then $sir_gawaine$ was all abashed and with galatine his good sword he smote through shield and thick hauberk made of thick mails and all to rushed and break the precious stones and made him a large #wound# that men might see both liver and lung
then groaned that $black_knight$ and addressed him to $sir_gawaine$ and with an awk #stroke# gave him a great #wound# and cut a vein which grieved $sir_gawaine$ sore and he bled sore
then the $black_knight$ said to $sir_gawaine$ bind thy #wound# or thy blee ding change for thou be bleedest all thy horse and thy fair #arm# for all the barbers of brittany shall not con staunch thy blood for whosomever is #hurt# with this blade he shall never be staunched of bleeding
then answered $sir_gawaine$ it grieveth me but little thy great words shall not fear me nor lessen my courage but thou shalt suffer teen and #sorrow# or we depart but tell me in haste who may staunch my bleeding
that may i do said the $black_knight$ if i will and so will i if thou wilt succour and aid me that i may be christened and believe on god
i grant said $sir_gawaine$ so god #help# me to accomplish all thy desire but first tell me what thou soughtest here thus alone and of what #land# and liegiance thou art of
sir he said my name is $priamus$ and a great prince is my father and he hath been rebel unto rome and overridden many of their #land#
and thereof i require thee of thy manhood and it shall be great merit for thy #soul# my father is lineally descended of alexander and of hector by right line
i am right inheritor of alexandria and africa and all the out isles yet will i believe on thy lord that thou believest on and for thy labour i shall give thee treasure enough
and duke joshua and maccabaeus were of our lineage i was so elate and hauteyn in my heart that i thought no man my peer nor to me semblable
i was sent into this #war# with seven score #knight# and now i have encountered with thee which hast given to me of fighting my fill wherefore sir $black_knight$
i am no $black_knight$ said $sir_gawaine$ i have been brought up in the guardrobe with the noble $king_arthur_s_court$ many years for to take heed to his armour and his other array and to point his paltocks that long to himself
at yule last he made me yeoman and gave to me horse and harness and an hundred pound in money and if #fortune# be my friend i doubt not but to be well advanced and holpen by my liege lord
ah said $priamus$ if his knaves be so keen and fierce his #knight# be passing good now for the $king_arthur_s_court$ love of heaven whether thou be a knave or a $black_knight$ tell thou me thy name
by god said $sir_gawaine$ now i will say thee sooth my name is $sir_gawaine$ and known i am in his #court# and in his chamber and one of the #knight# of the round table
therefore grudge not if this grace is to me fortuned it is the goodness of god that lent to me my strength
i pray thee to tell me what thou art he dubbed me a duke with his own hand now am i better pleased said $priamus$ than thou hadst given to me all the provence and paris the rich
i had liefer to have been torn with wild horses than any varlet had won such loos or any #page# or priker should have had #prize# on me
but now sir $black_knight$ i warn thee that hereby is a duke of lorraine with his army and the noblest men of dolphiny and lords of lombardy with the garrison of godard and saracens of southland numbered sixty thousand of good men of #arm# wherefore but if we hie us hence it will harm us both for we be sore #hurt# never like to recover but take heed to my #page# that he no horn blow for if he do there be hoving here fast by an hundred #knight# awaiting on my person and if they take thee there shall no ransom of gold nor silver acquit thee
then $sir_gawaine$ rode over a water for to save him and the $black_knight$ followed him and so rode forth till they came to his fellows which were in the meadow where they had been all the night
anon as sir wisshard was #ware# of $sir_gawaine$ and saw that he was #hurt# he ran to him sorrowfully weeping and demanded of him who had so #hurt# him and $sir_gawaine$ told how he had foughten with that man and each of them had #hurt# other and how he had salves to heal them but i can tell you other tidings that soon we shall have ado with many #enemy#
then sir $priamus$ and $sir_gawaine$ alighted and let their horses graze in the meadow and unarmed them and then the blood ran freshly from their #wound#
and $priamus$ took from his #page# a vial full of the four waters that came out of paradise and with certain balm anointed their #wound# and washed them with that water and within an hour after they were both as whole as ever they were
and then with a trumpet were they all assembled to council and there $priamus$ told unto them what lords and #knight# had sworn to rescue him and that without fail they should be assailed with many thousands wherefore he counselled them to withdraw them
then $sir_gawaine$ said it were great shame to them to avoid without any #stroke# wherefore i advise to take our #arm# and to make us ready to meet with these saracens and misbelieving men and with the #help# of god we shall overthrow them and have a fair #day# on them
and sir florence shall abide still in this field to keep the stale as a noble $black_knight$ and we shall not forsake yonder fellows
for i warn you #ye# shall find in yonder #wood# many perilous #knight# they will put forth beasts to call you on they be out of number and #ye# are not past seven hundred which be over few to fight with so many
nevertheless said $sir_gawaine$ we shall once encounter them and see what they can do and the best shall have the victory
now said $priamus$ cease your words chapter xi how the saracens came out of a #wood# for to rescue their beasts and of a great battle
then followed him seven hundred men of #arm# and sir ferant of spain on a fair steed came springing out of the #wood# and came to sir florence and asked him why he fled
then sir florence took his spear and rode against him and smote him in the forehead and #brake# his #neck# bone
then all the other were moved and thought to avenge the death of sir ferant and smote in among them and there was great fight and many slain and laid down to ground and sir florence with his hundred #knight# alway kept the stale and fought manly
then when $priamus$ the good $black_knight$ perceived the great fight he went to $sir_gawaine$ and bade him that he should go and succour his fellowship which were sore bestead with their #enemy#
then sir florence called to him sir floridas with an hundred #knight# and drove forth the herd of beasts sir grieve you not said $sir_gawaine$ for their gree shall be theirs
i shall not once move my horse to them ward but if i see more than there be for they be strong enough to match them
and with that he saw an earl called sir ethelwold and the duke of dutchmen came leaping out of a #wood# with many thousands and $priamus$ #knight# and came straight unto the battle
then $sir_gawaine$ comforted his #knight# and bade them not to be abashed for all shall be ours then they began to wallop and met with their #enemy# there were men slain and overthrown on every side
then thrust in among them the #knight# of the table round and smote down to the earth all them that withstood them in so much that they made them to recoil and flee
then entered into the battle jubance a #giant# and fought and slew down right and distressed many of our #knight# among whom was slain sir gherard a $black_knight$ of wales
by god said $sir_gawaine$ this gladdeth my heart for now be they less in number by twenty thousand then our #knight# took heart to them and slew many saracens
and then came in sir $priamus$ with his pennon and rode with the #knight# of the round table and fought so manfully that many of their #enemy# lost their lives
and there sir $priamus$ slew the marquis of moises #land# and $sir_gawaine$ with his fellows so quit them that they had the field but in that stour was sir chestelaine a child and ward of $sir_gawaine$ slain wherefore was much #sorrow# made and his death was soon avenged
then sir florence and $sir_gawaine$ harboured surely their people and took great plenty of bestial of gold and silver and great treasure and riches and returned unto $king_arthur_s_court$ which lay still at the #siege#
and when they came to the $king_arthur_s_court$ they presented their #prisoner# and recounted their adventures and how they had vanquished their #enemy#
how $sir_gawaine$ returned to $king_arthur_s_court$ with his #prisoner# and how the $king_arthur_s_court$ won a city and how he was crowned emperor
thus was the battle ended and many lords of lombardy and saracens left dead in the field chapter xii now thanked be god said the noble $king_arthur_s_court$
sir said $sir_gawaine$ this is a good man of #arm# he hath matched me but he is yielden unto god and to me for to become christian had not he have been we should never have returned wherefore
but what manner man is he that standeth by himself him seemeth no #prisoner# i pray you that he may be baptised for there
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let him anon be christened and did do call him his first name $priamus$ and made him a duke and $black_knight$ of the table round
and then anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ let do cry assault to the city and there was rearing of ladders breaking of walls and the ditch filled that men with little pain might enter into the city
then came out a duchess and clarisin the countess with many #lady# and damosels and kneeling before $king_arthur_s_court$ required him for the love of god to receive the city and not to take it by assault for then should many guiltless be slain
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ avaled his visor with a meek and noble #countenance# and said madam there shall #none# of my subjects misdo you nor your #maiden# nor to #none# that to you belong but the duke shall abide my judgment
then anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded to leave the assault and anon the duke oldest son brought out the keys and kneeling delivered them to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and besought him of grace and the $king_arthur_s_court$ seized the town by assent of his lords and took the duke and sent him to dover there for to abide #prisoner# term of his life and assigned certain rents for the dower of the duchess and for her children
then he made lords to rule those #land# and laws as a lord ought to do in his own country and after he took his journey toward rome and sent sir floris and sir floridas to #fore# with five hundred men of #arm# and they came to the city of urbino and laid there a bushment thereas them seemed most best for them and rode to #fore# the town where anon issued out much people and skirmished with the #fore# riders
then #brake# out the bushment and won the #bridge# and after the town and set upon the walls the $king_arthur_s_court$ banner
then came the $king_arthur_s_court$ upon an hill and saw the city and his banner on the walls by which he knew that the city was won
and anon he sent and commanded that #none# of his liege men should defoul nor lie by no #lady# #wife# nor maid and when he came into the city he passed to the castle and comforted them that were in #sorrow# and ordained there a captain a $black_knight$ of his own country
and when they of milan heard that thilk city was won they sent to $king_arthur_s_court$ great sums of money and besought him as their lord to have pity on them promising to be his subjects for ever and yield to him homage and fealty for the #land# of pleasance and pavia petersaint and the port of tremble and to give him yearly a million of gold all his lifetime
then he rideth into tuscany and winneth towns and castles and wasted all in his #way# that to him will not obey and so to spolute and viterbe and from thence he rode into the vale of vicecount among the vines
liveth not a nobler man nor better $black_knight$ of his hands and from thence he sent to the #senator# to #wit# whether they would know him for their lord
but soon after on a saturday came unto $king_arthur_s_court$ all the #senator# that were left alive and the noblest cardinals that then dwelt in rome and prayed him of #peace# and proferred him full large and besought him as governor to give licence for six weeks for to assemble all the romans and then to crown him emperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high estate
i assent said the $king_arthur_s_court$ like as #ye# have devised and at christmas there to be crowned and to hold my round table with my #knight# as me liketh
and at the #day# appointed as the romance telleth he came into rome and was crowned emperor by the pope hand with all the royalty that could be made and sojourned there a time and established all his #land# from rome into france and gave #land# and realms unto his servants and #knight# to everych after his desert in such wise that #none# complained rich nor poor
and he gave to sir $priamus$ the duchy of lorraine and he thanked him and said he would serve him the #day# of his life and after made dukes and earls and made every man rich
then after this all his #knight# and lords assembled them afore him and said blessed be god your #war# is finished and your conquest achieved in so much that we know #none# so great nor mighty that dare make #war# against you wherefore we beseech you to return homeward and give us licence to go home to our #wife# from whom we have been long and to #rest# us for your journey is finished with honour and worship
and then the #senator# made ready for his enthronization then said the $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# say truth and for to tempt god
it is no wisdom and therefore make you ready and return we into england then there was trussing of harness and baggage and great carriage
and after licence given he returned and commanded that no man in pain of death should not rob nor take victual nor other #thing# by the #way# but that he should pay therefore
and thus he came over the sea and landed at sandwich against whom #queen# $dame_guenever$ his #wife# came and met him and he was nobly received of all his commons in every city and burgh and great gifts presented to him at his home coming to welcome him with
thus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that $king_arthur_s_court$ had against $lucius_the_emperor$ of rome and here followeth the sixth book which is of sir $launcelot_du_lake$
book vi chapter i how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $lionel$ departed from the #court# and how sir $lionel$ left him sleeping and was taken
soon after that $king_arthur_s_court$ was come from rome into england then all the #knight# of the table round resorted unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and made many jousts and #tournament# and some there were that were but #knight# which increased so in #arm# and worship that they passed all their fellows in prowess and noble deeds and that was well proved on many but in especial it was proved on sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for in all #tournament# and jousts and deeds of #arm# both for life and death he passed all other #knight# and at no time he was never overcome but if it were by #treason# or enchantment so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ increased so marvellously in worship and in honour therefore is he the first $black_knight$ that the french book maketh mention of after $king_arthur_s_court$ came from rome
wherefore #queen# $dame_guenever$ had him in great favour above all other #knight# and in certain he loved the #queen# again above all other #lady# and damosels of his life and for her he did many deeds of #arm# and saved her from the fire through his noble chivalry
and then he thought himself to prove himself in strange adventures then he bade his nephew sir $lionel$ for to make him ready for we two will seek adventures
so they mounted on their horses armed at all rights and rode into a deep forest and so into a deep plain
thus sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rested him long with play and game and then the weather was hot about noon and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had great lust to sleep
then sir $lionel$ espied a great apple tree that stood by an hedge and said brother yonder is a fair shadow there may we #rest# us and our horses
it is well said fair brother said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for this eight year i was not so sleepy as i am now
and so they there alighted and tied their horses unto sundry trees and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ laid him down under an appletree and his #helm# he laid under his #head#
and sir $lionel$ waked while he slept so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was asleep passing fast and in the meanwhile there came three #knight# riding as fast fleeing as ever they might ride
and when sir $lionel$ saw him him thought he saw never so great a $black_knight$ nor so well faring a man neither so well apparelled unto all rights
so within a while this strong $black_knight$ had overtaken one of these #knight# and there he smote him to the cold earth that he lay still
and there followed them three but one $black_knight$ and then he rode unto the second $black_knight$ and smote him so that man and horse fell down
and then he alighted down and reined his horse on the bridle and bound all the three #knight# fast with the reins of their own bridles
when sir $lionel$ saw him do thus he thought to assay him and made him ready and stilly and privily he took his horse and thought not for to awake sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and when he was mounted upon his horse he overtook this strong $black_knight$ and bade him turn and the other smote sir $lionel$ so hard that horse and man he bare to the earth and so he alighted down and bound him fast and threw him overthwart his own horse and so he served them all four and rode with them away to his own castle
and when he came there he gart unarm them and beat them with thorns all naked and after put them in a deep prison where were many more #knight# that made great dolour
and then straight to the third $black_knight$ he rode and smote him behind his horse arse a spear length chapter ii
when sir $ector_de_maris$ wist that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was passed out of the #court# to seek adventures he was wroth with himself and made him ready to seek sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and as he had ridden long in a great forest he met with a man was like a forester
how sir $ector_de_maris$ followed for to seek sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and how he was taken by sir $turquine$ fair fellow said sir $ector_de_maris$ knowest thou in this country any adventures that be here #nigh# hand
sir said the forester this country know i well and hereby within this mile is a strong manor and well dyked and by that manor on the left hand there is a fair ford for horses to drink of and over that ford there groweth a fair tree and thereon hang many fair shields that wielded sometime good #knight# and at the hole of the tree hangeth a basin of copper and latten and strike upon that basin with the butt of thy spear thrice and soon after thou shalt hear new tidings and else hast thou the fairest grace that many a year had ever $black_knight$ that passed through this forest
and among them he saw his brother shield sir $lionel$ and many more that he knew that were his fellows of the round table the which grieved his heart and promised to revenge his brother
then anon sir $ector_de_maris$ beat on the basin as he were #wood# and then he gave his horse drink at the ford and there came a $black_knight$ behind him and bade him come out of the water and make him ready and sir $ector_de_maris$ anon turned him shortly and in feuter cast his spear and smote the other $black_knight$ a great #buffet# that his horse turned twice about
this was well done said the strong $black_knight$ and knightly thou hast stricken me and therewith he rushed his horse on sir $ector_de_maris$ and cleight him under his right #arm# and bare him clean out of the saddle and rode with him away into his own hall and threw him down in midst of the floor
gramercy said sir $ector_de_maris$ and departed and came to the tree and saw many fair shields the name of this $black_knight$ was sir $turquine$
then he said unto sir $ector_de_maris$ for thou hast done this #day# more unto me than any $black_knight$ did these twelve years now will i grant thee thy life so thou wilt be sworn to be my #prisoner# all thy life #day#
nay said sir $ector_de_maris$ that will i never promise thee but that i will do mine advantage that me repenteth said sir $turquine$
and then he gart to unarm him and beat him with thorns all naked and sithen put him down in a deep dungeon where he knew many of his fellows
but when sir $ector_de_maris$ saw sir $lionel$ then made he great #sorrow# alas brother said sir $ector_de_maris$ where is my brother sir $launcelot_du_lake$
fair brother i left him asleep when that i from him yode under an apple tree and what is become of him i cannot tell you
alas said the #knight# but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ #help# us we may never be delivered for we know now no $black_knight$ that is able to match our #master# $turquine$
chapter iii how four #queen# found $launcelot_du_lake$ sleeping and how by enchantment he was taken and led into a castle now leave we these #knight# #prisoner# and speak we of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that lieth under the apple tree sleeping
even about the noon there came by him four #queen# of great estate and for the heat should not annoy them there rode four #knight# about them and bare a #cloth# of green silk on four spears betwixt them and the sun and the #queen# rode on four white mules
thus as they rode they heard by them a great horse grimly neigh then were they #ware# of a sleeping $black_knight$
that lay all armed under an apple tree anon as these #queen# looked on his face they knew it was sir $launcelot_du_lake$
we shall not strive said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ that was $king_arthur_s_court$ sister i shall put an enchantment upon him that he shall not awake in six hours and then i will lead him away unto my castle and when he is surely within my hold i shall take the enchantment from him and then let him choose which of us he will have unto #paramour#
so this enchantment was cast upon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and then they laid him upon his shield and bare him so on horseback betwixt two #knight# and brought him unto the castle chariot and there they laid him in a chamber cold and at night they sent unto him a fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ with his supper ready dight
then they began for to strive for that $black_knight$ everych one said they would have him to her love by that the enchantment was past and when she came she saluted him and asked him what #cheer#
i cannot say fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for i wot not how i came into this castle but it be by an enchantment
sir said she #ye# must make good #cheer# and if #ye# be such a $black_knight$ as it is said #ye# be i shall tell you more to morn by prime of the #day#
gramercy fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ of your good will i require you and so she departed and there he lay all that night without comfort of anybody
and on the morn early came these four #queen# passingly well beseen all they bidding him good morn and he them again
sir $black_knight$ the four #queen# said thou must understand thou art our #prisoner# and we here know thee well that thou art sir $launcelot_du_lake$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ son and because we understand your worthiness that thou art the noblest $black_knight$ living and as we know
well there can no #lady# have thy love but one and that is #queen# $dame_guenever$ and now thou shalt lose her for ever and she thee and therefore thee behoveth now to choose one of us four
i am the $queen_morgan_le_fay$ #queen# of the #land# of gore and here is the #queen# of northgalis and the #queen# of eastland and the #queen# of the out isles now choose one of us which thou wilt have to thy #paramour# for thou mayest not choose or else in this prison to die
had i liefer to die in this prison with worship than to have one of you to my #paramour# maugre my #head#
and therefore #ye# be answered i will #none# of you for #ye# be false enchantresses and as for my #lady# $dame_guenever$ were i at my liberty as i was i would prove it on you or on yours that she is the truest #lady# unto her lord living
this is an hard case said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that either i must die or else choose one of you yet well said the #queen# is this your #answer# that #ye# will refuse us
yea on my life said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ refused #ye# be of me so they departed and left him there alone that made great #sorrow#
chapter iv how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was delivered by the #mean# of a $damosel_of_the_lake$ right so at the noon came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ unto him with his dinner and asked him what #cheer#
sir she said that me repenteth but an #ye# will be ruled by me i shall #help# you out of this distress and #ye# shall have no shame nor villainy so that #ye# hold me a promise
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ i will grant you and sore i am of these #queen# sorceresses afeard for they have destroyed many a good $black_knight$
sir said she that is sooth and for the renown and bounty that they hear of you they would have your love and sir they say your name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ the flower of #knight# and they be passing wroth with you that #ye# have refused them
but sir an #ye# would promise me to #help# my father on tuesday next coming that hath made a #tournament# betwixt him and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis for the last tuesday past my father lost the field through three #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# an #ye# will be there on tuesday next coming and #help# my father to morn or prime by the grace of god i shall deliver you clean
truly fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ in my life #day# never so ill fair #maiden# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ tell me what is your father name and then shall i give you an #answer#
i know your father well said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for a noble $king_arthur_s_court$ and a good $black_knight$ and by the faith of my body #ye# shall have my body ready to do your father and you
sir $black_knight$ she said my father is $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ that was foul rebuked at the last #tournament# service at that #day#
and i shall be she that shall deliver you and take you your armour and your horse shield and spear and hereby within this ten mile is an abbey of white monks
sir she said gramercy and to morn await #ye# be ready betimes there i pray you that #ye# me abide and thither shall i bring my father unto you
and so she departed and came on the morn early and found him ready then she brought him out of twelve locks and brought him unto his armour and when he was clean armed she brought him until his own horse and lightly he saddled him and took a great spear in his hand and so rode forth and said fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ i shall not fail you by the grace of god
all this shall be done said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ as i am true $black_knight$ and so he rode into a great forest all that #day# and never could find no highway
and so the night fell on him and then was he #ware# in a slade of a #pavilion# of red sendal
by my faith said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ in that #pavilion# will i lodge all this night and so there he alighted down and tied his horse to the #pavilion# and there he unarmed him and there he found a #bed# and laid him therein and fell asleep sadly
chapter how a $black_knight$ found sir $launcelot_du_lake$ lying in his leman #bed# and how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ fought with the $black_knight$
then within an hour there came the $black_knight$ to whom the #pavilion# ought and he weened that his leman had lain in that #bed# and so he laid him down beside sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and took him in his #arm# and began to kiss him
and when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ felt a rough beard kissing him he started out of the #bed# lightly and the other $black_knight$ after him and either of them gat their swords in their hands and out at the #pavilion# door went the $black_knight$ of the #pavilion# and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ followed him and there by a little slake sir $launcelot_du_lake$ wounded him sore #nigh# unto the death
and then he yielded him unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and so he granted him so that he would tell him why he came into the #bed#
sir said the $black_knight$ the #pavilion# is mine own and there this night i had assigned my #lady# to have slept with me and now i am likely to die of this #wound#
that me repenteth said $launcelot_du_lake$ of your #hurt# but i was adread of #treason# for i was late beguiled and therefore come on your #way# into your #pavilion# and take your #rest# and as i suppose i shall staunch your blood
that was a passing fair #lady# and when she espied that her lord belleus was sore wounded she cried out on sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and made great dole out of measure
#peace# my #lady# and my love said belleus for this $black_knight$ is a good man and a $black_knight$ adventurous and there he told her all the #cause# how he was wounded and when that i yielded me unto him he left me goodly and hath staunched my blood
and so they went both into the #pavilion# and anon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ staunched his blood therewithal came the $black_knight$ #lady# sir said the #lady# i require thee tell me what $black_knight$
so me thought ever by your speech said the #lady# for i have seen you oft or this and i know you better than #ye# ween
but now an #ye# would promise me of your courtesy for the harms that #ye# have done to me and my lord belleus that when he cometh unto $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# for to #cause# him to be made $black_knight$ of the round table for he is a passing good man of #arm# and a mighty lord of #land# of many out isles
fair #lady# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ let him come unto the #court# the next high feast and look that #ye# come with him and i shall do my power
#ye# be and what is your name fair #lady# he said my name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ an #ye# prove you doughty of your hands that #ye# shall have your desire
so thus within a while as they thus talked the night passed and the #day# shone and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ armed him and took his horse and they taught him to the abbey and thither he rode within the space of two hours
and soon as sir $launcelot_du_lake$ came within the abbey yard the daughter of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ heard a great horse go on the pavement
chapter vi how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was received of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ daughter and how he made his #complaint# to her father and she then arose and yede unto a window and there she saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and anon
she made men fast to take his horse from him and let lead him into a stable and himself was led into a fair chamber and unarmed him and the #lady# sent him a long gown and anon
she came herself and then she made $launcelot_du_lake$ passing good #cheer# and she said he was the $black_knight$ in the world
was most welcome to her then in all haste she sent for her father $king_bagdemagus$ that was within twelve mile of that abbey and afore
even he came with a fair fellowship of #knight# with him and when the $king_arthur_s_court$ was alighted off his horse he yode straight unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ chamber
and there he found his daughter and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ embraced sir $launcelot_du_lake$ in his #arm# and either made other good #cheer#
anon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ made his #complaint# unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ how he was betrayed and how his brother sir $lionel$ was departed from him
he wist not where and how his daughter had delivered him out of prison therefore while i live i shall do her service and all her kindred
then am i sure of your #help# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ on tuesday next coming yea sir said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i shall not fail you for so
i have promised my #lady# your daughter but sir what #knight# be they of my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ that were with the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis
and the $king_arthur_s_court$ said it was sir mador de la porte and sir $mordred$ and sir gahalantine that all for fared my #knight# for against them
sir said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ as i hear say that the #tournament# shall be here within this three mile of this abbey #ye# shall send unto me three #knight# of yours such as #ye# trust and look that the three #knight# have all white shields and i also and no painture on the shields and we four will come out of a little #wood# in midst of both parties and we shall fall in the front of our #enemy# and grieve them that we may and thus shall i not be known what $black_knight$ i am
so they took their #rest# that night and this was on the sunday and so the $king_arthur_s_court$ departed and sent unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ three #knight# with the four white shields
three i nor my #knight# might bear no strength and on the tuesday they lodged them in a little leaved #wood# beside there
the #tournament# should be and there were scaffolds and holes that lords and #lady# might behold and to give the #prize#
then came into the field the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis with eight score #helm# and then the three #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ stood by themselves
and then they feutred their spears and came together with a great dash and there were slain of #knight# at the first recounter twelve of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ party and six of the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis party and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ party was far set aback
then came into the field $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ with four score of #helm# chapter vii how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ behaved him in a #tournament# and how he met with sir $turquine$ leading sir $gaheris$
with that came sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and he thrust in with his spear in the thickest of the press and there he smote down with one spear five #knight# and of four of them he #brake# their backs
and in that throng he smote down the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis and #brake# his thigh in that fall all this doing of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ saw the three #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$
yonder is a shrewd guest said sir mador de la porte therefore have here once at him so they encountered and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ bare him down horse and man so that his shoulder went out of lith
sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was #ware# of him and gat a great spear in his hand and met him and sir $mordred$ #brake# a spear upon him and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ gave him such a #buffet# that the arson of his saddle #brake# and so he flew over his horse tail that his #helm# butted into the earth a foot and more that #nigh# his #neck# was broken and there he lay long in a swoon
then came in sir gahalantine with a great spear and $launcelot_du_lake$ against him with all their strength that they might drive that both their spears to brast even to their hands and then they flang out with their swords and gave many a grim #stroke#
then was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ wroth out of measure and then he smote sir gahalantine on the #helm# that his nose brast out on blood and ears and mouth both and therewith his #head# hung low
now befalleth it to me to joust said $mordred$ for sir mador hath a sore fall and therewith his horse ran away with him and he fell down to the earth
anon therewithal sir $launcelot_du_lake$ gat a great spear in his hand and or ever that great spear #brake# he bare down to the earth sixteen #knight# some horse and man and some the man and not the horse and there was #none# but that he hit surely he bare #none# #arm# that #day#
and then he gat another great spear and smote down twelve #knight# and the most part of them never throve after
and then the #knight# of the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis would joust no more and there the gree was given to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$
so either party departed unto his own place and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode forth with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ unto his castle and there he had passing good #cheer# both with the $king_arthur_s_court$ and with his daughter and they proffered him great gifts
and on the morn he took his leave and told the $king_arthur_s_court$ that he would go and seek his brother sir $lionel$ that went from him when that he slept so he took his horse and betaught them all to god
and there he said unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter if #ye# have need any time of my service i pray you let me have knowledge and i shall not fail you as i am true $black_knight$
and in the midst of a highway he met a $damosel_of_the_lake$ riding on a white palfrey and there either saluted other
and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ departed and by adventure he came into the same forest there he was taken sleeping fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ know
#ye# in this country any adventures sir $black_knight$ said that $damosel_of_the_lake$ here are adventures near hand an thou durst prove them
well said she thou seemest well to be a good $black_knight$ and if thou dare meet with a good $black_knight$ i shall bring thee where is the best $black_knight$ and the mightiest that ever thou found so thou wilt tell me what is thy name and what $black_knight$ thou art
why should i not prove adventures said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for that #cause# come i hither $damosel_of_the_lake$ as for to tell thee my name
sir thou beseemest well here be adventures by that fall for thee for hereby dwelleth a $black_knight$ that will not be overmatched for no man i know
i take no great #force# truly my name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but #ye# overmatch him and his name is sir $turquine$
and as i understand he hath in his prison of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# good #knight# three score and four that he hath won with his own hands
but when #ye# have done that journey #ye# shall promise me as #ye# are a true $black_knight$ for to go with me and to #help# me and other damosels that are distressed daily with a false $black_knight$
now fair $black_knight$ come on your #way# and so she brought him unto the ford and the tree where hung the basin
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ let his horse drink and then he beat on the basin with the butt of his spear so hard with all his might till the bottom fell out and long he did so but he saw nothing
all your intent $damosel_of_the_lake$ and desire i will fulfil so #ye# will bring me unto this $black_knight$ then he rode endlong the gates of that manor #nigh# half an hour
and then was he #ware# of a great $black_knight$ that drove an horse afore him and overthwart the horse there lay an armed $black_knight$ bound
and ever as they came near and near sir $launcelot_du_lake$ thought he should know him then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was #ware# that it was sir $gaheris$ $sir_gawaine$ brother a $black_knight$ of the table round
now fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i see yonder cometh a $black_knight$ fast bounden that is a fellow of mine and brother he is unto $sir_gawaine$
and at the first beginning i promise you by the leave of god to rescue that $black_knight$ but if his #master# sit better in the saddle i shall deliver all the #prisoner# that he hath out of danger for i am sure he hath two brethren of mine #prisoner# with him
now fair $black_knight$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ put that wounded $black_knight$ off the horse and let him #rest# awhile and let us two prove our strengths for as it is informed me thou doest and hast done great despite and shame unto #knight# of the round table and therefore now defend thee
by that time that either had seen other they gripped their spears unto them an thou be of the table round said $turquine$ i defy thee and all thy fellowship
and then they put their spears in the #rest# and came together with their horses as fast as they might run and either smote other in midst of their shields that both their horses backs brast under them and the #knight# were both stonied
and as soon as they might avoid their horses they took their shields afore them and drew out their swords and came together eagerly and either gave other many strong #stroke# for there might neither shields nor harness hold their #stroke#
that is overmuch said said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ chapter viii how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $turquine$ fought together and so within a while they had both grimly #wound# and bled passing grievously
thus they fared two hours or more trasing and rasing either other where they might hit any bare place then at the last they were breathless both and stood leaning on their swords
then $turquine$ said thou art the biggest man that ever i met withal and the best breathed and like one $black_knight$ that i hate above all other #knight# so be it that thou be not he
i will lightly accord with thee and for thy love i will deliver all the #prisoner# that i have that is three score and four so thou wilt tell me thy name
now fellow said sir $turquine$ hold thy hand a while and tell me what i shall ask thee say on and thou
and i we will be fellows together and never to fail thee while that i live it is well said said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but sithen it is so that i may have thy friendship
faithfully said sir $turquine$ his name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for he slew my brother sir $king_carados$ at the dolorous tower that was one of the best #knight# alive and therefore him
i except of all #knight# for may i once meet with him the one of us shall make an end of other i make mine avow
and for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sake i have slain an hundred good #knight# and as many i have maimed all utterly that they might never after #help# themselves and many have died in prison and yet have i three score and four and all shall be delivered so thou wilt tell me thy name so be it that thou be not sir $launcelot_du_lake$
now see i well said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that such a man i might be i might have #peace# and such a man i might be that there should be #war# mortal betwixt us
and now sir $black_knight$ at thy request i will that thou #wit# and know that i am $launcelot_du_lake$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ son of benwick and very $black_knight$ of the table round
what $black_knight$ is he that thou so hatest above all other and now i defy thee and do thy best
ah said $turquine$ $launcelot_du_lake$ thou art unto me most welcome that ever was $black_knight$ for we shall never depart till the one of us be dead
then they hurtled together as two wild bulls rushing and lashing with their shields and swords that sometime they fell both over their noses
thus they fought still two hours and more and never would have #rest# and sir $turquine$ gave sir $launcelot_du_lake$ many #wound# that all the ground thereas they fought was all bespeckled with blood
chapter ix how sir $turquine$ was slain and how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ bade sir $gaheris$ deliver all the #prisoner# then at the last sir $turquine$ waxed faint and gave somewhat aback and bare his shield low for weariness
that espied sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and leapt upon him fiercely and gat him by the beaver of his helmet and plucked him down on his knees and anon he raced off his #helm# and smote his #neck# in sunder
and when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had done this he yode unto the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and said $damosel_of_the_lake$ i am ready to go with you where #ye# will have me but i have no horse
fair sir said she take this wounded $black_knight$ horse and send him into this manor and command him to deliver all the #prisoner#
nay fair lord said $gaheris$ i will that #ye# take my horse at your own commandment for #ye# have both saved me and my horse and
this #day# i say #ye# are the best $black_knight$ in the world for #ye# have slain this #day# in my sight the mightiest man and the best $black_knight$ except you that ever i saw and fair sir said $gaheris$ i pray you tell me your name
sir my name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that ought to #help# you of right for $king_arthur_s_court$ sake and in especial for my lord $sir_gawaine$ sake your own dear brother and when that #ye# come within yonder manor i am sure #ye# shall find there many #knight# of the round table for i have seen many of their shields that i know on yonder tree
there is $kay_the_seneschal$ shield and sir brandel shield and sir $marhaus$ shield and sir galind shield and sir $brian_de_les_isles$ de listnois shield and sir aliduke shield with many more that i am not now advised of and also my two brethren shields sir $ector_de_maris$ and sir $lionel$ wherefore i pray you greet them all from me and say that i bid them take such stuff there as they find and that in any wise my brethren go unto the #court# and abide me there till that i come for by the feast of pentecost
i cast me to be there for as at this time i must ride with this $damosel_of_the_lake$ for to save my promise
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ went unto $gaheris$ and prayed him not to be aggrieved for to lend him his horse and so he departed from $gaheris$ and $gaheris$ yede in to the manor and
anon withal sir $gaheris$ threw the porter unto the ground and took the keys from him and hastily he opened the prison door and there he let out all the #prisoner# and every man loosed other of their bonds
there he found a yeoman porter keeping there many keys and when they saw sir $gaheris$ all they thanked him for they weened that he was wounded
not so said $gaheris$ it was $launcelot_du_lake$ that slew him worshipfully with his own hands i saw it with mine own eyes
and he greeteth you all well and prayeth you to haste you to the #court# and as unto sir $lionel$ and $ector_de_maris$
he prayeth you to abide him at the #court# that shall we not do says his brethren we will find him an we may live
then all those #knight# sought the house thereas the armour was and then they armed them and every $black_knight$ found his own horse and all that ever longed unto him
so shall i said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ find him or i come at the #court# as i am true $black_knight$ and when this was done there came a forester with four horses laden with fat venison
anon sir $kay_the_seneschal$ said here is good meat for us for one meal for we had not many a #day# no good repast
and so that venison was roasted baken and sodden and so after supper some abode there all night but sir $lionel$ and $ector_de_maris$ and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ rode after sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to find him if they might
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ and slew a $black_knight$ that distressed all #lady# and also a villain that kept a #bridge#
sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ here by this #way# haunteth a $black_knight$ that distressed all #lady# and gentlewomen and at the least he robbeth them or lieth by them
chapter now turn we unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that rode with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ in a fair highway what said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ is he a thief and a $black_knight$ and a ravisher of women
but fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# shall ride on afore yourself and i will keep myself in covert and if that he trouble you or distress you
he doth shame unto the order of knighthood and contrary unto his #oath# it is pity that he liveth i shall be your rescue and learn him to be ruled as a $black_knight$
so the maid rode on by the #way# a soft ambling pace and within a while came out that $black_knight$ on horseback out of the #wood# and his #page# with him and there he put the $damosel_of_the_lake$ from her horse and then she cried
with that came $launcelot_du_lake$ as fast as he might till he came to that $black_knight$ saying thou false $black_knight$ and traitor unto knighthood who did learn thee to distress #lady# and gentlewomen
when the $black_knight$ saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ thus rebuking him he answered not but drew his sword and rode unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ threw his spear from him and drew out his sword and struck him such a #buffet# on the helmet that he clave his #head# and #neck# unto the throat
now hast thou thy payment that long thou hast deserved that is truth said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for like as sir $turquine$ watched to destroy #knight#
so did this $black_knight$ attend to destroy and distress #lady# damosels and gentlewomen and his name was sir peris de forest $balin_le_savage$
nay sir she said at this time but almighty $o_jesu$ preserve you wheresomever #ye# ride or go for the curteist $black_knight$ thou art and meekest unto all #lady# and gentlewomen that now liveth
now $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ will #ye# any more service of me but one #thing# sir $black_knight$ methinketh #ye# lack #ye# that are a $black_knight$ wifeless
that he will not love some #maiden# or gentlewoman for i could never hear say that ever #ye# loved any of no manner degree and that is great pity but it is noised that #ye# love #queen# $dame_guenever$ and that she hath ordained by enchantment that #ye# shall never love #none# other but her nor #none# other $damosel_of_the_lake$ nor #lady# shall rejoice you wherefore many in this #land# of high estate and low make great #sorrow#
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i may not warn people to speak of me what it pleaseth them but for to be a wedded man i think it not for then i must couch with her and leave #arm# and #tournament# battles and adventures and as for to say for to take my pleasaunce with #paramour# that will i refuse in principal for dread of god for #knight# that be adventurous or lecherous shall not be happy nor fortunate unto the #war# for other they shall be overcome with a simpler $black_knight$ than they be themselves other else they shall by unhap and their cursedness slay better men than they be themselves
and so who that useth #paramour# shall be unhappy and all #thing# is unhappy that is about them and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and she departed
so on the third #day# he rode over a long #bridge# and there stert upon him suddenly a passing foul churl and he smote his horse on the nose that he turned about and asked him why he rode over that #bridge# without his licence
and then he rode in a deep forest two #day# and more and had strait lodging why should i not ride this #way# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i may not ride beside
thou shalt not choose said the churl and lashed at him with a great club shod with iron then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ drew his sword and put the #stroke# aback and clave his #head# unto the paps
at the end of the #bridge# was a fair village and all the people men and women cried on sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and said a worse deed didst thou never for thyself for thou hast slain the chief porter of our castle
sir $launcelot_du_lake$ let them say what they would and straight he went into the castle and when he came into the castle he alighted and tied his horse to a ring on the wall and there he saw a fair green #court# and thither he dressed him for there him thought was a fair place to fight in
so he looked about and saw much people in doors and windows that said fair $black_knight$ thou art unhappy chapter xi
anon withal came there upon him two great #giant# well armed all save the #head# with two horrible clubs in their hands
sir $launcelot_du_lake$ put his shield afore him and put the #stroke# away of the one #giant# and with his sword he clave his #head# asunder
when his fellow saw that he ran away as he were #wood# for fear of the horrible #stroke# and $launcelot_du_lake$ after him with all his might and smote him on the shoulder and clave him to the navel
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ went into the hall and there came afore him three score #lady# and damosels and all kneeled unto him and thanked god and him of their deliverance for sir said they the most party of us have been here this seven year their #prisoner# and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat and we are all great gentlewomen born and blessed be the time $black_knight$ that ever thou be born for thou hast done the most worship that ever did $black_knight$ in this world that will we bear record and we all pray you to tell us your name that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ slew two #giant# and made a castle free fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ he said my name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$
ah sir said they all well mayest thou be he for else save yourself as we deemed there might never $black_knight$ have the better of these two #giant# for many fair #knight# have assayed it and here have ended and many times have we wished after you and these two #giant# dread never $black_knight$ but you
now may #ye# say said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ unto your friends how and who hath delivered you and greet them all from me and if that i come in any of your marches show me such #cheer# as #ye# have #cause# and what treasure that there in this castle is i give it you for a reward for your grievance and the lord that is owner of this castle i would he received it as is right
fair sir said they the name of this castle is tintagil and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair $lady_igraine$ and after wedded her $uther_pendragon$ and gat on her $king_arthur_s_court$
well said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i understand to whom this castle longeth and so he departed from them and betaught them unto god
and then he mounted upon his horse and rode into many strange and wild countries and through many waters and #valley# and evil was he lodged
and at the last by #fortune# him happened against a night to come to a fair courtelage and therein he found an old gentlewoman that lodged him with good will and there he had good #cheer# for him and his horse
and when time was his host brought him into a fair garret over the gate to his #bed# there sir $launcelot_du_lake$ unarmed him and set his harness by him and went to #bed# and anon he fell asleep
so soon after there came one on horseback and knocked at the gate in great haste and when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ heard this he arose up and looked out at the window and saw by the moonlight three #knight# came riding after that one man and all three lashed on him at once with swords and that one $black_knight$ turned on them knightly again and defended him
shall i #help# for it were shame for me to see three #knight# on one and if he be slain i am partner of his death and therewith
he took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four #knight# and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ said on high turn you #knight# unto me and leave your fighting with that $black_knight$
and then they all three left sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and turned unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and there began great battle for they alighted all three and struck many great #stroke# at sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and assailed him on every side
truly said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ yonder one $black_knight$ then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ dressed him for to have holpen sir $launcelot_du_lake$ nay sir said he
i will #none# of your #help# therefore as #ye# will have my #help# let me alone with them sir $kay_the_seneschal$ for the pleasure of the $black_knight$ suffered him for to do his will and so stood aside
and then anon within six #stroke# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had stricken them to the earth and then they all three cried sir $black_knight$ we yield us unto you as a man of might makeless
but so that #ye# will yield you unto sir $kay_the_seneschal$ on that covenant i will save your lives and else not
fair $black_knight$ said they that were we loath to do for as for sir $kay_the_seneschal$ we chased him hither and had overcome him had not #ye# been therefore to yield us unto him
well as to that said $launcelot_du_lake$ advise you well for #ye# may choose whether #ye# will die or live for an #ye# be yolden it shall be unto sir $kay_the_seneschal$
as to that said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i will not take your yielding unto me it were no reason fair $black_knight$ then they said in saving of our lives we will do as thou commandest us
then shall #ye# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ on whitsunday next coming go unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and there shall #ye# yield you unto #queen# $dame_guenever$ and put you all three in her grace and mercy and say that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ sent you thither to be her #prisoner#
sir they said it shall be done by the faith of our bodies an we be living and there they swore every $black_knight$ upon his sword
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword and with that came his host and in they entered sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and he
and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ suffered them so to depart sir said his host i weened #ye# had been in your #bed#
so i was said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but i rose and leapt out at my window for to #help# an old fellow of mine
and so when they came #nigh# the light sir $kay_the_seneschal$ knew well that it was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and therewith he kneeled down and thanked him of all his kindness that he had holpen him twice from the death
sir he said i have nothing done but that me ought for to do and #ye# are welcome and here shall #ye# repose you and take your #rest#
so when sir $kay_the_seneschal$ was unarmed he asked after meat so there was meat fetched him and he ate strongly and when he had supped they went to their #bed# and were lodged together in one #bed#
on the morn sir $launcelot_du_lake$ arose early and left sir $kay_the_seneschal$ sleeping and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ took sir $kay_the_seneschal$ armour and his shield and armed him and so he went to the stable and took his horse and took his leave of his host and so he departed
then soon after arose sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and missed sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and then he espied that he had his armour and his horse
i know well that he will grieve some of the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ for on him #knight# will be bold and deem that it is i and that will beguile them
now by my faith and because of his armour and shield i am sure i shall ride in #peace# and then soon after departed sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and thanked his host
now turn we unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that had ridden long in a great forest and at the last he came into a low country full of fair rivers and meadows
chapter xii how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode disguised in sir $kay_the_seneschal$ harness and how he smote down a $black_knight$ and afore him he saw a long #bridge# and three #pavilion# stood thereon of silk and sendal of #diver# hue
and without the #pavilion# hung three white shields on truncheons of spears and great long spears stood upright by the #pavilion# and at every #pavilion# door stood three fresh squires and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ passed by them and spake no word
when he was passed the three #knight# said them that it was the proud $kay_the_seneschal$ he weeneth no $black_knight$ so good as he and the contrary is ofttime proved
by my faith said one of the #knight# his name was sir gaunter i will ride after him and assay him for all his pride and #ye# may behold how that i speed
so this $black_knight$ sir gaunter armed him and hung his shield upon his shoulder and mounted upon a great horse and gat his spear in his hand and walloped after sir $launcelot_du_lake$
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ turned him and either feutred their spears and came together with all their mights and sir gaunter spear #brake# but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote him down horse and man
and when sir gaunter was at the earth his brethren said each one to other yonder $black_knight$ is not sir $kay_the_seneschal$ for he is bigger than he
i dare lay my #head# said sir gilmere yonder $black_knight$ hath slain sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and hath taken his horse and his harness
whether it be so or no said sir raynold the third brother let us now go mount upon our horses and rescue our brother sir gaunter upon pain of death
we all shall have work enough to match that $black_knight$ for ever meseemeth by his person it is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or sir $tristram_de_liones$ or sir $pelleas$ the good $black_knight$
then anon they took their horses and overtook sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir gilmere put forth his spear and ran to sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote him down that he lay in a swoon
sir $black_knight$ said sir raynold thou art a strong man and as i suppose thou hast slain my two brethren for the which raseth my heart sore against thee and if i might with my worship
i would not have ado with you but needs i must take part as they do and therefore $black_knight$ he said keep thyself
and when he came #nigh# him he cried abide thou proud $black_knight$ sir $kay_the_seneschal$ for thou shalt not pass quit and so they hurtled together with all their mights and all to shivered both their spears
anon therewith arose sir gaunter and came unto his brother sir gilmere and bade him arise and #help# we our brother sir raynold that yonder marvellously matched yonder good $black_knight$
and then they drew their swords and lashed together eagerly therewithal they leapt on their horses and hurtled unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and when he saw them come he smote a sore #stroke# unto sir raynold that he fell off his horse to the ground and then he struck to the other two brethren and at two #stroke# he struck them down to the earth
now let be said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i was not far from thee when thou wert made $black_knight$ sir raynold and also i know thou art
with that sir raynold began to start up with his #head# all bloody and came straight unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ a good $black_knight$ and
gramercy said sir raynold as for your goodness and i dare say as for me and my brethren we will not be loath to yield us unto you with that we knew your name
loath i were to slay thee for well we know #ye# are not sir $kay_the_seneschal$ as for that be it as it be
may for #ye# shall yield you unto $dame_guenever$ and look that #ye# be with her on whitsunday and yield you unto her as #prisoner# and say that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ sent you unto her
then they swore it should be done and so passed forth sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and each one of the brethren holp other
as well as they might chapter xiii how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ jousted against four #knight# of the round table and overthrew them
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode into a deep forest and thereby in a slade he saw four #knight# hoving under an oak and they were of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# one was sir sagramour le desirous and $ector_de_maris$ and $sir_gawaine$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$
now by my faith said sir sagramour i will prove sir $kay_the_seneschal$ might and gat his spear in his hand and came toward sir $launcelot_du_lake$
therewith sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was #ware# and knew him well and feutred his spear against him and smote sir sagramour so sore that horse and man fell both to the earth
lo my fellows said he yonder #ye# may see what a #buffet# he hath that $black_knight$ is much bigger than ever was sir $kay_the_seneschal$
anon as these four #knight# had espied sir $launcelot_du_lake$ they weened by his #arm# it had been sir $kay_the_seneschal$ now shall #ye# see what i may do to him
so sir $ector_de_maris$ gat his spear in his hand and walloped toward sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote him through the shield and shoulder that man and horse went to the earth and ever his spear held
by my faith said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ yonder is a strong $black_knight$ and i am sure he hath slain sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and i see by his great strength it will be hard to match him
and therewithal sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ gat his spear in his hand and rode toward sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ knew him well and so he met him on the plain and gave him such a #buffet# that he was astonied that long he wist not where he was
then he dressed his shield and gat a good spear in his hand and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ knew him well and then they let run their horses with all their mights and either $black_knight$ smote other in midst of the shield
now see i well said $sir_gawaine$ i must encounter with that $black_knight$ but $sir_gawaine$ spear to brast and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ charged so sore upon him that his horse reversed up so down
and much #sorrow# had $sir_gawaine$ to avoid his horse and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ passed on a pace and smiled and said god give him joy that this spear made for there came never a better in my hand
then the four #knight# went each one to other and comforted each other what say #ye# by this guest said $sir_gawaine$ that one spear hath felled us all four
#ye# may well say it said $sir_gawaine$ that he is a man of might for i dare lay my #head#
we commend him unto the devil they said all for he is a man of great might it is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i know it by his riding
let him go said $sir_gawaine$ for when we come to the #court# then shall we #wit# and then had they much #sorrow# to get their horses again
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ followed a brachet into a castle where he found a dead $black_knight$ and how he after was required of a $damosel_of_the_lake$ to heal her brother
now leave we there and speak of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that rode a great while in a deep forest where he saw a black brachet seeking in manner as it had been in the feute of an #hurt# deer
chapter xiv and therewith he rode after the brachet and he saw lie on the ground a large feute of blood
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode after and ever the brachet looked behind her and so she went through a great marsh and ever sir $launcelot_du_lake$ followed
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode over that #bridge# that was old and feeble and when he came in midst of a great hall there he saw lie a dead $black_knight$ that was a seemly man and that brachet licked his #wound#
and therewithal came out a #lady# weeping and wringing her hands and then she said $black_knight$ too much #sorrow# hast thou brought me
and then was he #ware# of an old manor and thither ran the brachet and so over the #bridge# why say #ye#
this brachet brought me and therefore fair #lady# be not displeased with me for i am full sore aggrieved of your grievance
so said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i did never this $black_knight$ no harm for hither by feute of blood truly sir she said i trow it be not #ye# that hath slain my husband
for he that did that deed is sore wounded and he is never likely to recover that shall i ensure him
sir said she his name was called sir gilbert the bastard one of the best #knight# of the world and he that hath slain him
what was your husband name said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i know not his name now god send you better comfort said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and so he departed and went into the forest again and
there he met with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ the which knew him well and she said aloud well be #ye# found my lord and now i require thee on thy knighthood #help# my brother that is sore wounded and never stinteth bleeding for this #day# he fought with sir gilbert the bastard and slew him in plain battle and there was my brother sore wounded and there is a #lady# a sorceress that dwelleth in a castle here beside and
this #day# she told me my brother #wound# should never be whole till i could find a $black_knight$ that would go into the #chapel# perilous and there he should find a sword and a bloody #cloth# that the wounded $black_knight$ was lapped in and a piece of that #cloth# and sword should heal my brother #wound# so that his #wound# were searched with the sword and the #cloth#
this is a marvellous #thing# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but what is your brother name sir she said his name was sir meliot de logres
that me repenteth said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for he is a fellow of the table round and to his #help# i will do my power
then sir said she follow even this highway and it will bring you unto the #chapel# perilous and here i shall abide till god send you here again and but you speed i know no $black_knight$ living that may achieve that adventure
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ came into the #chapel# perilous and gat there of a dead corpse a piece of the #cloth# and a sword
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ departed and when he came unto the #chapel# perilous he alighted down and tied his horse unto a little gate
and as soon as he was within the churchyard he saw on the front of the #chapel# many fair rich shields turned up so down and many of the shields sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had seen #knight# bear beforehand
there stand a thirty great #knight# more by a yard than any man that ever he had seen and all those grinned and gnashed at sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and when he saw their #countenance# he dreaded him sore and so put his shield afore him and took his sword ready in his hand ready unto battle and they were all armed in black harness ready with their shields and their swords drawn
and when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ would have gone throughout them they scattered on every side of him and gave him the #way# and therewith he waxed all bold and entered into the #chapel# and then he saw no light but a dim lamp burning and
chapter xv right with that he saw by him then was he #ware# of a corpse hilled with a #cloth# of silk
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ stooped down and cut a piece away of that #cloth# and then it fared under him as the earth had quaked a little
and then he saw a fair sword lie by the dead $black_knight$ and that he gat in his hand and hied him out of the #chapel#
all the #knight# spake to him with a grimly voice and said $black_knight$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ lay that sword from thee or else thou shalt die
whether that i live or die said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ with no great word get #ye# it again therefore fight for it an #ye# list
so he passed throughout them and beyond the #chapel# yard there met him a fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ and said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ leave that sword behind thee or thou wilt die for it
therewithal he feared anon as ever he was in the #chapel# yard then right i leave it not said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for no treaties
no said she an thou didst leave that sword #queen# $dame_guenever$ should thou never see then were i a #fool# an
i would leave this sword said $launcelot_du_lake$ now gentle $black_knight$ said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ i require thee to kiss me but once
well sir said she an thou hadst kissed me thy life #day# had been done but now alas she said i have lost all my labour for i ordained this #chapel# for thy sake and for $sir_gawaine$
and once i had $sir_gawaine$ within me and at that time he fought with that $black_knight$ that lieth there dead in yonder #chapel# sir gilbert the bastard and at that time he smote the left hand off of sir gilbert the bastard
and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ now i tell thee i have loved thee this seven year but there may no woman have thy love but #queen# $dame_guenever$
but sithen i may not rejoice thee to have thy body alive i had kept no more joy in this world but to have thy body dead
then would i have balmed it and served it and so have kept it my life #day# and daily i should have clipped thee and kissed thee in despite of #queen# $dame_guenever$
nay said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that god me forbid #ye# say well said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ $o_jesu$ preserve me from your subtle crafts
and as the book saith when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was departed she took such #sorrow# that she died within a fourteen night and her name was hellawes the sorceress #lady# of the castle nigramous
and therewithal he took his horse and so departed from her anon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ met with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ sir meliot sister
and when she saw him she clapped her hands and wept for joy and then they rode unto a castle thereby where lay sir meliot
when sir meliot saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ he kneeled upon his knees and cried on high lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ #help# me
and anon as sir $launcelot_du_lake$ saw him he knew him but he was passing pale as the earth for bleeding anon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ leapt unto him and touched his #wound# with sir gilbert sword
and then he wiped his #wound# with a part of the bloody #cloth# that sir gilbert was wrapped in and anon an wholer man in his life
and then there was great joy between them and they made sir $launcelot_du_lake$ all the #cheer# that they might and so on the morn sir $launcelot_du_lake$ took his leave and bade sir meliot hie him to the #court# of my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ for it draweth #nigh# to the feast of pentecost and there by the grace of god #ye# shall find me
was he never and therewith they departed chapter xvi how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ at the request of a #lady# recovered a falcon by which he was deceived
and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode through many strange countries over marshes and #valley# till by #fortune# he came to a fair castle and as he passed beyond the castle him thought he heard two bells ring
came flying over his #head# toward an high elm and long lunes about her feet and as she flew unto the elm to take her perch the lunes over cast about a bough
and when she would have taken her flight she hung by the legs fast and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ saw how she hung and beheld the fair falcon perigot and he was sorry for her
the meanwhile came a #lady# out of the castle and cried on high $launcelot_du_lake$ launcelot as thou art flower of all #knight# #help# me to get my hawk for an my hawk be lost my lord will destroy me for i kept the hawk and she slipped from me and if my lord my husband #wit# it
and then was he #ware# of a falcon he is so hasty that he will slay me what is your lord name said sir $launcelot_du_lake$
since that #ye# know my name and require me of knighthood to #help# you i will do what i may to get your hawk and yet god knoweth i am an ill climber and the tree is passing high and few boughs to #help# me withal
sir she said his name is sir phelot a $black_knight$ that longeth unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis well fair #lady# and therewith sir $launcelot_du_lake$ alighted and tied his horse to the same tree and prayed the #lady# to unarm him
and so when he was unarmed he put off all his clothes unto his shirt and breech and with might and #force# he clomb up to the falcon and tied the lines to a great rotten boyshe and threw the hawk down and it withal
that was her husband all armed and with his naked sword in his hand and said $black_knight$ $launcelot_du_lake$ now have i found thee as i would and stood at the bole of the tree to slay him
anon the #lady# gat the hawk in her hand and therewithal came out sir phelot out of the groves suddenly ah #lady# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ why have #ye# betrayed me
she hath done said sir phelot but as i commanded her and therefore there nis #none# other boot but thine hour is come that thou must die
that were shame unto thee said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ thou an armed $black_knight$ to slay a naked man by #treason# thou gettest #none# other grace said sir phelot and therefore #help# thyself an thou canst
truly said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that shall be thy shame but since thou wilt do #none# other take mine harness with thee and hang my sword upon a bough that i may get it and then do thy best to slay me an thou canst
nay nay said sir phelot for i know thee better than thou weenest therefore thou gettest no weapon an i may keep you therefrom
and therewith he waited above him and under him and over his #head# he saw a rownsepyk a big bough leafless and therewith he #brake# it off by the body
and then he came lower and awaited how his own horse stood and suddenly he leapt on the further side of the horse fro ward the $black_knight$
alas said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that ever a $black_knight$ should die weaponless and then sir phelot lashed at him eagerly weening to have slain him
but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ put away the #stroke# with the rownsepyk and therewith he smote him on the one side of the #head# that he fell down in a swoon to the ground
so then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ took his sword out of his hand and struck his #neck# from the body then cried the #lady# alas
i am not causer said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for with falsehood #ye# would have had slain me with #treason# and now it is fallen on you both
and therewithal sir $launcelot_du_lake$ gat all his armour as well as he might and put it upon him for dread of more resort for he dreaded that the $black_knight$ castle was so #nigh#
and so as soon as he might he took his horse and departed and thanked god that he had escaped that adventure
why hast thou slain my husband and then she swooned as though she would die chapter #xvii# how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ overtook a $black_knight$ which chased his #wife# to have slain her and how he said to him
and as he rode in a #valley# he saw a $black_knight$ chasing a #lady# with a naked sword to have slain her
and by #fortune# as this $black_knight$ should have slain this #lady# she cried on sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and prayed him to rescue her
when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ saw that mischief he took his horse and rode between them saying $black_knight$ fie for shame why wilt thou slay this #lady#
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode many wild #way# throughout marches and many wild #way# thou dost shame unto thee and all #knight#
what hast thou to do betwixt me and my #wife# said the $black_knight$ i will slay her maugre thy #head# that shall #ye# not said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for rather we two will have ado together
sir $launcelot_du_lake$ said the $black_knight$ thou dost not thy part for this #lady# hath betrayed me it is not so said the #lady# truly he saith wrong on me
and for because i love and cherish my cousin germain he is jealous betwixt him and me and as i shall #answer# to god there was never sin
but sir said the #lady# as thou art called the worshipfullest $black_knight$ of the world i require thee of true knighthood keep me and save me
betwixt us for whatsomever #ye# say he will slay me for he is without mercy have #ye# no doubt said $launcelot_du_lake$ it shall not lie in his power
and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode on the one side and she on the other he had not ridden but a while but the $black_knight$ bade sir $launcelot_du_lake$ turn him and look behind him and said sir yonder come men of #arm# after us riding
and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ turned him and thought no #treason# and therewith was the $black_knight$ and the #lady# on one side and suddenly he swapped off his #lady# #head#
and when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had espied him what he had done he said and called him traitor thou hast shamed me for ever
and suddenly sir $launcelot_du_lake$ alighted off his horse and pulled out his sword to slay him and therewithal he fell flat to the earth and gripped sir $launcelot_du_lake$ by the thighs and cried mercy
fie on thee said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ thou shameful $black_knight$ thou mayest have no mercy and therefore arise and fight with me
sir said the $black_knight$ in your sight i will be ruled as #ye# will have me nay said the $black_knight$ i will never arise till #ye# grant me mercy
now will i proffer thee fair said $launcelot_du_lake$ i will unarm me unto my shirt and i will have nothing upon me but my shirt and my sword and my hand
well said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ take this #lady# and the #head# and bear it upon thee and here shalt thou swear upon my sword to bear it always upon thy back and never to #rest# till thou come to #queen# $dame_guenever$
and if thou canst slay me quit be thou for ever nay sir said pedivere that will i never sir said he that will i do by the faith of my body
now said $launcelot_du_lake$ tell me what is your name sir my name is pedivere in a shameful hour wert thou born said $launcelot_du_lake$
so pedivere departed with the dead #lady# and the #head# and found the #queen# with $king_arthur_s_court$ at winchester and there he told all the truth
sir $black_knight$ said the #queen# this is an horrible deed and a shameful and a great #rebuke# unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but notwithstanding his worship is not known in many #diver# countries but this shall i give you in penance make #ye# as good shift as #ye# can #ye# shall bear this #lady# with you on horseback unto the pope of rome and of him receive your penance for your foul deeds and #ye# shall never #rest# one night whereas #ye# do another an #ye# go to any #bed# the dead body shall lie with you
and as it telleth in the french book when he came to rome the pope bade him go again unto #queen# $dame_guenever$ and in rome was his #lady# buried by the pope commandment
this #oath# there he made and so departed and after this sir pedivere fell to great goodness and was an holy man and an hermit
chapter xviii how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ came to $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and how there were recounted all his noble #feat# and #act#
now turn we unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that came home two #day# afore the feast of pentecost and the $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the #court# were passing fain of his coming
and when $sir_gawaine$ sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ sir $sagramore$ sir $ector_de_maris$ saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ in $kay_the_seneschal$ armour then they wist well it was he that smote them down all with one spear
and ever now and now came all the #knight# home that sir $turquine$ had #prisoner# and they all honoured and worshipped sir $launcelot_du_lake$
when sir $gaheris$ heard them speak he said i saw all the battle from the beginning to the ending and there he told $king_arthur_s_court$ all how it was and how sir $turquine$ was the strongest $black_knight$ that ever he saw except sir $launcelot_du_lake$ there were many #knight# bare him record #nigh# three score
then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ told the $king_arthur_s_court$ how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had rescued him when he should have been slain and how he made the #knight# yield them to me and not to him
then there was laughing and smiling among them and there they were all three and bare record and by $o_jesu$ said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ because sir $launcelot_du_lake$ took my harness and left me his
i rode in good #peace# and no man would have ado with me anon therewithal there came the three #knight# that fought with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ at the long #bridge#
and there they yielded them unto sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ forsook them and said he fought never with them but i shall ease your heart said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ yonder is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that overcame you
and then sir meliot de logres came home and told the $king_arthur_s_court$ how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had saved him from the death
and all his deeds were known how four #queen# sorceresses had him in prison and how he was delivered by $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ daughter
also there were told all the great deeds of #arm# that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ did betwixt the two #king# that is for to say the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$
all the truth sir gahalantine did tell and sir mador de la porte and sir $mordred$ for they were at that same #tournament#
when they wist that they were glad then came in the #lady# that knew sir $launcelot_du_lake$ when that he wounded sir belleus at the #pavilion#
and so at that time sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had the greatest name of any $black_knight$ of the world and most he was honoured of high and low
and there at request of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir belleus was made $black_knight$ of the round table explicit the noble tale of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ which is the vi
here followeth the tale of sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that was called $beaumains$ by sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and is the seventh book
when $king_arthur_s_court$ held his round table most plenour it fortuned that he commanded that the high feast of pentecost should be holden at a city and a castle the which in those #day# was called kynke kenadonne upon the sands that marched #nigh# wales
so ever the $king_arthur_s_court$ had a custom that at the feast of pentecost in especial afore other feasts in the year he would not go that #day# to meat until he had heard or seen of a great #marvel#
book book vii chapter i how $beaumains$ came to $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and demanded three petitions of $king_arthur_s_court$ and for that custom all manner of strange adventures came before $king_arthur_s_court$ as at that feast before all other feasts
and so $sir_gawaine$ a little to #fore# noon of the #day# of pentecost espied at a window three men upon horseback and a dwarf on foot and so the three men alighted and the dwarf kept their horses and one of the three men was higher than the other twain by a foot and an half
then $sir_gawaine$ went unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and said sir go to your meat for here at the hand come strange adventures
and there were all the #knight# of the round table save only those that were #prisoner# or slain at a recounter
then at the high feast evermore they should be fulfilled the whole number of an hundred and fifty for then was the round table fully complished
right so came into the hall two men well beseen and richly and upon their shoulders there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest that ever they all saw and he was large and long and broad in the shoulders and well visaged and the fairest and the largest handed that ever man saw but he fared as though he might not go nor bear himself
anon as $king_arthur_s_court$ saw him there was made #peace# and room and right so they yede with him unto the high dais without saying of any words
then this much young man pulled him aback and easily stretched up straight saying $king_arthur_s_court$ god you bless and all your fair fellowship and in especial the fellowship of the table round
and for this #cause# i am come hither to pray you and require you to give me three gifts and they shall not be unreasonably asked but that #ye# may worshipfully and honourably grant them me and to you
so $king_arthur_s_court$ went unto his meat with many other #king# but if he leaned upon their shoulders no great #hurt# nor loss
and the first don and gift i will ask now and the other two gifts i will ask this #day# twelvemonth wheresomever #ye# hold your high feast
now sir this is my petition for this feast that #ye# will give me meat and drink sufficiently for this twelvemonth and at that #day# i will ask mine other two gifts
my fair son said $king_arthur_s_court$ ask better i counsel thee for this is but a simple asking for my heart giveth me to thee greatly that thou art come of men of worship and greatly my conceit faileth me but thou shalt prove a man of right great worship
now ask said $king_arthur_s_court$ and #ye# shall have your asking sir he said thereof be as it be may i have asked that i will ask
well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# shall have meat and drink enough i never defended that #none# neither my friend nor my foe
but what is thy name i would #wit# i cannot tell you said he that is #marvel# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that thou knowest not thy name and thou art
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ betook him to sir $kay_the_seneschal$ the steward and charged him that he should give him of all manner of meats and drinks of the best and also that he had all manner of finding as though he were a lord son
that shall little need said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ to do such cost upon him for i dare undertake he is a villain born and never will make man for an he had come of #gentleman# he would have asked of you horse and armour but such as he is so he asketh
and sithen he hath no name i shall give him a name that shall be $beaumains$ that is fair hands and into the #kitchen# i shall bring him and there he shall have fat brose every #day# that he shall be as fat by the twelvemonths end as a pork hog
the goodliest young man that ever i saw right so the two men departed and beleft him to sir $kay_the_seneschal$ that scorned him and mocked him
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and $sir_gawaine$ were wroth because sir $kay_the_seneschal$ mocked $beaumains$ and of a $damosel_of_the_lake$ which desired a $black_knight$ to fight for a #lady#
chapter ii thereat was $sir_gawaine$ wroth and in especial sir $launcelot_du_lake$ bade sir $kay_the_seneschal$ leave his mocking for i dare lay my #head# he shall prove a man of great worship
beware said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ so #ye# gave the good $black_knight$ brewnor sir $dinadan$ brother a name and #ye# called him $la_cote_male_taile$ and that turned you to anger afterward
let be said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ it may not be by no reason for as he is so he hath asked as for that said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ this shall never prove #none# such
for sir brewnor desired ever worship and this desireth bread and drink and broth upon pain of my life he was fostered up in some abbey and howsomever it was they failed meat and drink and so hither he is come for his sustenance
and so sir $kay_the_seneschal$ bade get him a place and sit down to meat so $beaumains$ went to the hall door and set him down among #boy# and lads and there he ate sadly
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ after meat bade him come to his chamber and there he should have meat and drink enough
and so did $sir_gawaine$ but he refused them all he would do #none# other but as sir $kay_the_seneschal$ commanded him for no proffer
but as touching $sir_gawaine$ he had reason to proffer him lodging meat and drink for that proffer came of his blood for he was nearer kin to him than he wist
but that as sir $launcelot_du_lake$ did was of his great gentleness and courtesy so thus he was put into the #kitchen# and lay nightly as the #boy# of the #kitchen# did
and so he endured all that twelvemonth and never displeased man nor child but always he was meek and mild but ever when that he saw any jousting of #knight# that would he see an he might
and ever sir $launcelot_du_lake$ would give him gold to spend and clothes and so did $sir_gawaine$ and where there were any masteries done thereat would he be
and there might #none# cast bar nor stone to him by two yards then would sir $kay_the_seneschal$ say how liketh you my #boy# of the #kitchen#
and at that time the $king_arthur_s_court$ held it at carlion in the most royallest wise that might be like as he did yearly
so it passed on till the feast of whitsuntide but the $king_arthur_s_court$ would no meat eat upon the whitsunday until he heard some adventures
then came there a squire to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and said sir #ye# may go to your meat for here cometh a $damosel_of_the_lake$ with some strange adventures
then was the $king_arthur_s_court$ glad and sat him down right so there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ into the hall and saluted the $king_arthur_s_court$ and prayed him of succour
sir she said i have a #lady# of great worship and renown and she is besieged with a tyrant so that she may not out of her castle and because here are called the noblest #knight# of the world i come to you to pray you of succour
what hight your #lady# and where dwelleth she and who is she and what is his name that hath besieged her
sir $king_arthur_s_court$ she said as for my #lady# name that shall not #ye# know for me as at this time but i let you #wit# she is a #lady# of great worship and of great #land# and as for the tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth her #land# he is called the red $black_knight$ of the red launds
sir said $sir_gawaine$ i know him well for he is one of the perilloust #knight# of the world men say that he hath seven men strength and from him i escaped once full hard with my life
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said the $king_arthur_s_court$ there be #knight# here would do their power for to rescue your #lady# but because you will not tell her name nor where she dwelleth therefore #none# of my #knight# that here be now shall go with you by my will
for whom said the $king_arthur_s_court$ what is the adventure i know him not said the $king_arthur_s_court$ then must i speak further said the $damosel_of_the_lake$
how $beaumains$ desired the battle and how it was granted to him and how he desired to be made $black_knight$ of sir $launcelot_du_lake$
with these words came before the $king_arthur_s_court$ $beaumains$ while the $damosel_of_the_lake$ was there and thus he said sir $king_arthur_s_court$ god thank you i have been this twelvemonth in your #kitchen# and have had my full sustenance and now i will ask my two gifts that be behind
sir this shall be my two gifts first that #ye# will grant me to have this adventure of the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for it belongeth unto me
then sir this is the other gift that #ye# shall bid $launcelot_du_lake$ to make me $black_knight$ for of him i will be made $black_knight$ and else of #none#
and when i am passed i pray you let him ride after me and make me $black_knight$ when i require him
chapter iii ask upon my peril said the $king_arthur_s_court$ thou shalt have it said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i grant it thee all this shall be done said the $king_arthur_s_court$
fie on thee said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ shall i have #none# but one that is your #kitchen# #page# then was she wroth and took her horse and departed
and with that there came one to $beaumains$ and told him his horse and armour was come for him and there was
the dwarf come with all #thing# that him needed in the richest manner thereat all the #court# had much #marvel# from whence came all that gear
right so as he came into the hall and took his leave of $king_arthur_s_court$ and $sir_gawaine$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and prayed that he would hie after him and so departed and rode after the $damosel_of_the_lake$
how $beaumains$ departed and how he gat of sir $kay_the_seneschal$ a spear and a shield and how he jousted with sir $launcelot_du_lake$
but there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and trapped in #cloth# of gold but he had neither shield nor spear
then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ said all open in the hall i will ride after my #boy# in the #kitchen# to #wit# whether he will know me for his better
so when he was armed there was #none# but few so goodly a man as he was and chapter iv said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and $sir_gawaine$ yet abide at home
so sir $kay_the_seneschal$ made him ready and took his horse and his spear and rode after him and right as $beaumains$ overtook the $damosel_of_the_lake$ right so came sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and said
then he turned his horse and knew it was sir $kay_the_seneschal$ that had done him all the despite as #ye# have heard afore
$beaumains$ what sir know #ye# not me yea said $beaumains$ i know you for an ungentle $black_knight$ of the #court# and therefore beware of me
therewith sir $kay_the_seneschal$ put his spear in the #rest# and ran straight upon him and $beaumains$ came as fast upon him with his sword in his hand and so he put away his spear with his sword and with a foin thrust him through the side that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ fell down as he had been dead and he alighted down and took sir $kay_the_seneschal$ shield and his spear and stert upon his own horse and rode his #way#
all that saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and so did the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and then he bade his dwarf stert upon sir $kay_the_seneschal$ horse and so he did
by that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was come then he proffered sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to joust and either made them ready and they came together so fiercely that either bare down other to the earth and sore were they bruised
and then $beaumains$ threw his shield from him and proffered to fight with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ on foot and so they rushed together like boars tracing rasing and foining to the mountenance of an hour and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ felt him so big that he marvelled of his strength for he fought more liker a #giant# than a $black_knight$ and that his fighting was durable and passing perilous
for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had so much ado with him that he dreaded himself to be shamed and said $beaumains$ fight not so sore your quarrel and mine is not so great
truly that is truth said $beaumains$ but it doth me good to feel your might and yet my lord i showed not the utterance
how $beaumains$ told to sir $launcelot_du_lake$ his name and how he was dubbed $black_knight$ of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and after overtook the $damosel_of_the_lake$
in god name said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for i promise you by the faith of my body i had as much to do as i might to save myself from you unshamed and therefore have #ye# no doubt of #none# earthly $black_knight$
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ arose and helped him from his horse but we may leave off chapter hope #ye# so that i may any while stand a proved $black_knight$
said $beaumains$ yea said $launcelot_du_lake$ do as #ye# have done and i shall be your warrant then i pray you said $beaumains$ give me the order of knighthood
then must #ye# tell me your name said $launcelot_du_lake$ and of what kin #ye# be born sir so that #ye# will not discover me i shall said $beaumains$
nay said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and that i promise you by the faith of my body until it be openly known then sir he said my name is $gareth_of_orkney$ and brother unto $sir_gawaine$ of father and #mother#
for ever me thought #ye# should be of great blood and that #ye# came not to the #court# neither for meat nor for drink
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ gave him the order of knighthood and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ prayed him for to depart and let him go
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ departed from him and came to sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and made him to be borne home upon his shield and so he was healed hard with the life and all men scorned sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and in especial $sir_gawaine$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ said it was not his part to #rebuke# no young man for full little knew he of what #birth# he is come and for what #cause# he came to this #court# and so we leave sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and turn we unto $beaumains$
ah sir said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i am more gladder of you than i was when he had overtaken the $damosel_of_the_lake$ anon
thy clothes be bawdy of the grease and tallow that thou gainest in $king_arthur_s_court$ #kitchen# weenest thou said she that i allow thee for yonder $black_knight$
she said what dost thou here thou stinkest all of the #kitchen# that thou killest nay truly for thou slewest him unhappily and cowardly therefore turn again bawdy #kitchen# #page#
i know thee well for sir $kay_the_seneschal$ named thee $beaumains$ what art thou but a lusk and a turner of broaches and a ladle washer
say for i have undertaken to $king_arthur_s_court$ for to achieve your adventure and so shall i finish it to the end either i shall die therefore
$damosel_of_the_lake$ said $beaumains$ say to me what #ye# will i will not go from you whatsomever #ye# fie on thee #kitchen# knave wilt thou finish mine adventure
thou shalt anon be met withal that thou wouldest not for all the broth that ever thou suppest once look him in the face
i shall assay said $beaumains$ so thus as they rode in the #wood# there came a man flying all that ever he might
o lord he said #help# me for here by in a slade are six thieves that have taken my lord and bound him
and so they rode together until they came thereas was the $black_knight$ bounden and then he rode unto them and struck one unto the death and then another and at the third #stroke# he slew the third thief and then the other three fled
and he rode after them and he overtook them and then those three thieves turned again and assailed $beaumains$ hard but at the last he slew them and returned and unbound the $black_knight$
and the $black_knight$ thanked him and prayed him to ride with him to his castle there a little beside and he should worshipfully reward him for his good deeds
sir said $beaumains$ i will no reward have i was this #day# made $black_knight$ of noble sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and therefore i will no reward have but god reward me
whither wilt thou said $beaumains$ so i am afeard lest they will slay him bring me thither said $beaumains$ and also i must follow this $damosel_of_the_lake$
for thou smellest all of the #kitchen# weenest thou that i have joy of thee for all this deed that thou hast done is but mishapped thee but thou shalt see a sight shall make thee turn again and that lightly
then the same $black_knight$ which was rescued of the thieves rode after that $damosel_of_the_lake$ and prayed her to lodge with him all that night
and because it was near night the $damosel_of_the_lake$ rode with him to his castle and there they had great #cheer# and at supper the $black_knight$ sat
and when he came #nigh# her she bade him ride from her sir $beaumains$ afore the $damosel_of_the_lake$ fie fie said she sir $black_knight$ #ye# are uncourteous to set a #kitchen# #page#
then the $black_knight$ was ashamed at her words and took him up and set him at a sideboard and set himself afore him and so all that night they had good #cheer# and merry #rest#
afore me him beseemeth better to stick a swine than to sit afore a $damosel_of_the_lake$ of high parage chapter vi
and on the morn the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and he took their leave and thanked the $black_knight$ and so departed and rode on their #way# until they came to a great forest
and there was a great river and but one passage and there were ready two #knight# on the farther side to let them the passage
how $beaumains$ fought and slew two #knight# at a passage what sayest thou said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ wilt thou match yonder #knight# or turn again
and therewithal he rushed into the water and in midst of the water either #brake# their spears upon other to their hands and then they drew their swords and smote eagerly at other
and at the last sir $beaumains$ smote the other upon the #helm# that his #head# stonied and therewithal he fell down in the water and there was he drowned
and then he spurred his horse upon the #land# where the other $black_knight$ fell upon him and #brake# his spear and so they drew their swords and fought long together
at the last sir $beaumains$ clave his #helm# and his #head# down to the shoulders and so he rode unto the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and bade her ride forth on her #way#
alas she said that ever a #kitchen# #page# should have that #fortune# to destroy such two doughty #knight# thou weenest thou hast done doughtily that is not so for the first $black_knight$ his horse stumbled and there he was drowned in the water and never it was by thy #force# nor by thy might
nay said sir $beaumains$ i will not turn again an they were six more and the last $black_knight$ by mishap thou camest behind him and mishappily thou slew him
$damosel_of_the_lake$ said $beaumains$ #ye# may say what #ye# will but with whomsomever i have ado withal i trust to god to serve him or he depart
and therefore i reck not what #ye# say so that i may win your #lady# fie fie foul #kitchen# knave thou shalt see #knight# that shall abate thy boast
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ give me goodly language and then my care is past for what #knight# somever they be i care not nor i doubt them not
also said she i say it for thine avail yet mayest thou turn again with thy worship for an thou follow me thou art but slain for i see all that ever thou dost is but by misadventure and not by prowess of thy hands
well $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# may say what #ye# will but wheresomever #ye# go i will follow you so this $beaumains$ rode with that #lady# till evensong time and ever she chid him and would not #rest#
and they came to a black laund and there was a black hawthorn and thereon hung a black banner and on the other side there hung a black shield and by it stood a black spear great and long and
a great black horse covered with silk and a black stone fast by chapter vii how $beaumains$ fought with the $black_knight$ of the black launds and fought with him till he fell down and died
then the $damosel_of_the_lake$ when she saw that $black_knight$ she bade him flee down that #valley# for his horse was not saddled
there sat a $black_knight$ all armed in black harness and his name was the $black_knight$ of the black laund gramercy said $beaumains$ for always #ye# would have me a coward
with that the $black_knight$ when she came #nigh# him spake and said $damosel_of_the_lake$ have #ye# brought this $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ to be your champion
nay fair $black_knight$ said she this is but a #kitchen# knave that was fed in $king_arthur_s_court$ #kitchen# for alms
sir i cannot be delivered of him said she for with me he rideth maugre mine #head# god would that #ye# should put him from me other to slay him an #ye# may for he is an unhappy knave and unhappily he hath done this #day# through mishap
i saw him slay two #knight# at the passage of the water and other deeds he did before right marvellous and through unhappiness
why cometh he said the $black_knight$ in such array it is shame that he beareth you company that marvelleth me said the $black_knight$ that any man that is of worship will have ado with him
they know him not said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and for because he rideth with me they ween that he be some man of worship born
that may be said the $black_knight$ howbeit as #ye# say that he be no man of worship he is a full likely person and full like to be a strong man but thus much shall i grant you said the $black_knight$ i shall put him down upon one foot and his horse and his harness he shall leave with me for it were shame to me to do him any more harm
when sir $beaumains$ heard him say thus he said sir $black_knight$ thou art full large of my horse and my harness
i let thee #wit# it cost thee nought and whether it liketh thee or not this laund will i pass maugre thine #head#
and horse nor harness gettest thou #none# of mine but if thou win them with thy hands and therefore let see what thou canst do
sayest thou that said the $black_knight$ now yield thy #lady# from thee for it beseemeth never a #kitchen# #page# to ride with such a #lady#
thou liest said $beaumains$ i am a #gentleman# born and of more high lineage than thou and that will i prove on thy body
then in great wrath they departed with their horses and came together as it had been the thunder and the $black_knight$ spear #brake# and $beaumains$ thrust him through both his sides and therewith his spear #brake# and the truncheon left still in his side
but nevertheless the $black_knight$ drew his sword and smote many eager #stroke# and of great might and #hurt# $beaumains$ full sore
but at the last the $black_knight$ within an hour and an half he fell down off his horse in swoon and there he died
and when $beaumains$ saw him so well horsed and armed then he alighted down and armed him in his armour and so took his horse and rode after the $damosel_of_the_lake$
when she saw him come #nigh# she said away #kitchen# knave out of the wind for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me
alas she said that ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a $black_knight$ as thou hast done but all this is thine unhappiness
but here by is one shall pay thee all thy payment and therefore yet i counsel thee flee it may happen me said $beaumains$ to be beaten or slain but i warn you fair $damosel_of_the_lake$
i will not flee away a nor leave your company for all that #ye# can say for ever #ye# say that they will kill me or beat me but howsomever it happeneth i escape and they lie on the ground
and therefore it were as good for you to hold you still thus all #day# rebuking me for away will i not till i see the uttermost of this journey or else i will be slain other truly beaten therefore ride on your #way# for follow you i will whatsomever happen
chapter viii how the brother of the $black_knight$ that was slain met with $beaumains$ and fought with $beaumains$ till he was yielden
as they rode together they saw a $black_knight$ come driving by them all in green both his horse and his harness and when he came #nigh# the $damosel_of_the_lake$ he asked her is that my brother the $black_knight$ that #ye# have brought with you
alas said the green $black_knight$ that is great pity that so noble a $black_knight$ as he was should so unhappily be slain and namely of a knave hand as #ye# say that he is
ah traitor said the green $black_knight$ thou shalt die for slaying of my brother he was a full noble $black_knight$ and his name was sir perard
thus nay nay she said this unhappy #kitchen# knave hath slain your brother through unhappiness i defy thee said $beaumains$ for i let thee #wit#
therewithal the green $black_knight$ rode unto an horn that was green and it hung upon a thorn and there he blew three deadly motes and there came two damosels and armed him lightly
i slew him knightly and not shamefully and then he took a great horse and a green shield and a green spear
and then they ran together with all their mights and #brake# their spears unto their hands and then they drew their swords and gave many sad #stroke# and either of them wounded other full ill
and at the last at an overthwart $beaumains$ with his horse struck the green $black_knight$ horse upon the side that he fell to the earth
that saw $beaumains$ and therewithal he alighted and they rushed together like two mighty kemps a long while and sore they bled both
and then the green $black_knight$ avoided his horse lightly and dressed him upon foot with that came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and said my lord the green $black_knight$ why for shame stand
alas it is shame that ever #ye# were made $black_knight$ to see such a lad to match such a $black_knight$ as the weed overgrew the corn
#ye# so long fighting with the #kitchen# knave therewith the green $black_knight$ was ashamed and therewithal he gave a great #stroke# of might and clave his shield through
he was a little ashamed of that #stroke# and of her language and then he gave him such a #buffet# upon the #helm# that he fell on his knees
and then the green $black_knight$ cried him mercy and yielded him unto sir $beaumains$ and prayed him to slay him not
when $beaumains$ saw his shield cloven asunder and so suddenly $beaumains$ pulled him upon the ground grovelling all is in vain said $beaumains$ for thou shalt die
but if this $damosel_of_the_lake$ that came with me pray me to save thy life and therewithal he unlaced his #helm# like as he would slay him
fie upon thee false #kitchen# #page# i will never pray thee to save his life for i will never be so much in thy danger
then shall he die said $beaumains$ not so hardy thou bawdy knave said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that thou slay him alas said the green $black_knight$ suffer me not to die for a fair word may save me
fair $black_knight$ said the green $black_knight$ save my life and i will forgive thee the death of my brother and for ever to become thy man and thirty #knight# that hold of me for ever shall do you service
in the devil name said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that such a bawdy #kitchen# knave should have thee and thirty #knight# service sir $black_knight$ said $beaumains$ all this availeth thee not
but if my $damosel_of_the_lake$ speak with me for thy life and therewithal he made a semblant to slay him let be said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ thou bawdy knave slay him not for an thou do thou shalt repent it
$damosel_of_the_lake$ said $beaumains$ your charge is to me a pleasure and at your commandment his life shall be saved and else not
then he said sir $black_knight$ with the green #arm# i release thee quit at this $damosel_of_the_lake$ request for i will not make her wroth i will fulfil all that she chargeth me
then said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ me repenteth green $black_knight$ of your damage and of your brother death the $black_knight$ for of your #help# i had great mister for i dread me sore to pass this forest
and then the green $black_knight$ kneeled down and did him homage with his sword nay dread you not said the green $black_knight$ for #ye# shall lodge with me this night and to morn
i shall #help# you through this forest so they took their horses and rode to his manor which was fast there beside
how the $damosel_of_the_lake$ again rebuked $beaumains$ and would not suffer him to sit at her table but called him #kitchen# #boy#
and ever she rebuked $beaumains$ and would not suffer him to sit at her table but as the green $black_knight$ took him and sat him at a side table
#marvel# methinketh said the green $black_knight$ to the $damosel_of_the_lake$ why #ye# #rebuke# this noble $black_knight$ as #ye# do for i warn you $damosel_of_the_lake$ he is a full noble $black_knight$ and i know no $black_knight$ is able to match him therefore #ye# do great wrong to #rebuke# him for he shall do you right good service for whatsomever he maketh himself
chapter ix #ye# shall prove at the end that he is come of a noble blood and of $king_arthur_s_court$ lineage
truly said the green $black_knight$ it were shame for me to say of him any disworship for he hath proved himself a better $black_knight$ than i am yet
fie fie said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ it is shame for you to say of him such worship have i met with many #knight# in my #day# and never or this time have i found
and so that night they yede unto #rest# and all that night the green $black_knight$ commanded thirty #knight# privily to watch $beaumains$ for to keep him from all #treason#
and so on the morn they all arose and heard their mass and #brake# their fast and then they took their horses and rode on their #way# and the green $black_knight$ conveyed them through the forest and there the green $black_knight$ said my lord $beaumains$ i and these thirty #knight# shall be always at your summons both early and late at your calling and whither that ever #ye# will send us
it is well said said $beaumains$ when that i call upon you #ye# must yield you unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and all your #knight#
no $black_knight$ his match if that #ye# so command us we shall be ready at all times said the green $black_knight$
fie fie upon thee in the devil name said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that any good #knight# should be obedient unto a #kitchen# knave
so then departed the green $black_knight$ and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and then she said unto $beaumains$ why followest thou me thou #kitchen# #boy#
cast away thy shield and thy spear and flee away yet i counsel thee betimes or thou shalt say right soon alas for wert thou as wight
as ever was wade or $launcelot_du_lake$ $tristram_de_liones$ or the good $black_knight$ sir $lamorak_de_galis$ thou shalt not pass a pass here that is called the pass perilous
$damosel_of_the_lake$ said $beaumains$ who is afeard let him flee for it were shame to turn again sithen i have ridden so long with you
well said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# shall soon whether #ye# will or not chapter how the third brother called the red $black_knight$ jousted and fought against $beaumains$ and how $beaumains$ overcame him
and over the tower gate there hung a fifty shields of #diver# colours and under that tower there was a fair meadow
and therein were many #knight# and squires to behold scaffolds and #pavilion# for there upon the morn should be a great #tournament# and the lord of the tower was in his castle and looked out at a window and saw a $damosel_of_the_lake$ a dwarf and a $black_knight$ armed at all points
so god me #help# said the lord with that $black_knight$ will i joust for i see that he is a $black_knight$ errant
so within a while they saw a tower as white as any snow well matchecold all about and double dyked and so he armed him and horsed him hastily
and when he was on horseback with his shield and his spear it was all red both his horse and his harness and all that to him longeth
and when that he came #nigh# him he weened it had been his brother the $black_knight$ and then he cried aloud
nay nay said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ it is not he this is but a #kitchen# knave that was brought up for alms in $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
ah said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ this knave hath killed thy brother and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ named him $beaumains$ and this horse and this harness was thy brother the $black_knight$
brother what do #ye# in these marches nevertheless said the red $black_knight$ i will speak with him or he depart also i saw thy brother the green $black_knight$ overcome of his hands
with this either #knight# departed in sunder and they came together with all their might and either of their horses fell to the earth and they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them and drew their swords and either gave other sad #stroke# now here now there rasing tracing foining and hurling like two boars the space of two hours
and then she cried on high to the red $black_knight$ alas thou noble red $black_knight$ think what worship hath followed thee let never a #kitchen# knave endure thee so long as he doth
then the red $black_knight$ waxed wroth and doubled his #stroke# and #hurt# $beaumains$ wonderly sore that the blood ran down to the ground that it was #wonder# to see that strong battle
yet at the last sir $beaumains$ struck him to the earth and as he would have slain the red $black_knight$ he cried mercy saying noble $black_knight$ slay me not and i shall yield me to thee with fifty #knight# with me that be at my commandment
and i forgive thee all the despite that thou hast done to me and the death of my brother the $black_knight$
now may #ye# be revenged upon him for i may never be quit of him all this availeth not said $beaumains$ but if my $damosel_of_the_lake$ pray me to save thy life
let be thou $beaumains$ slay him not for he is a noble $black_knight$ and not so hardy upon thine #head# but thou save him
and therewith he made semblant to strike off his #head# then $beaumains$ bade the red $black_knight$ stand up and thank the $damosel_of_the_lake$ now of thy life
then the red $black_knight$ prayed him to see his castle and to be there all night so the $damosel_of_the_lake$ then granted him and there they had merry #cheer#
but always the $damosel_of_the_lake$ spake many foul words unto $beaumains$ whereof the red $black_knight$ had great #marvel# and all that night the red $black_knight$ made three score #knight# to watch $beaumains$ that he should have no shame nor villainy
and upon the morn they heard mass and dined and the red $black_knight$ came before $beaumains$ with his three score #knight# and there he proffered him his homage and fealty at all times he and his #knight# to do him service
i thank you said $beaumains$ but this #ye# shall grant me when i call upon you to come afore my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ and yield you unto him to be his #knight#
sir said the red $black_knight$ i will be ready and my fellowship at your summons so sir $beaumains$ departed and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and ever she rode chiding him in the foulest manner
chapter xi how sir $beaumains$ suffered great #rebuke# of the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and he suffered it patiently $damosel_of_the_lake$ said $beaumains$ #ye# are uncourteous so to #rebuke# me as #ye# do for meseemeth
i shall be beaten with #knight# that we meet but ever for all your boast they lie in the dust or in the mire and
therefore i pray you #rebuke# me no more and when #ye# see me beaten or yielden as recreant then may #ye# bid me go from you shamefully but first i let you #wit# i will not depart from you for i were worse than a #fool# an i would depart from you all the while that i win worship
well said she right soon there shall meet a $black_knight$ shall pay thee all thy wages for he is the most man of worship of the world except $king_arthur_s_court$
i will well said $beaumains$ the more he is of worship the more shall be my worship to have ado with him
i have done you good service and ever #ye# threaten me then anon they were #ware# where was afore them a city rich and fair
a mile and an half there was a fair meadow that seemed new mown and therein were many #pavilion# fair to behold
lo said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ yonder is a lord that owneth yonder city and his custom is when the weather is fair to lie in this meadow to joust and tourney
and ever there be about him five hundred #knight# and #gentleman# of #arm# and there be all manner of games that any #gentleman# can devise
thou shalt see him time enough said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and so as she rode near she espied the #pavilion# where he was
lo said she seest thou yonder #pavilion# that is all of the colour of inde and all manner of #thing# that there is about men and women and horses trapped shields and spears were all of the colour of inde and his name is sir $persant$ of inde the most lordliest $black_knight$ that ever thou lookedst on
it may well be said $beaumains$ but be he never so stout a $black_knight$ in this field i shall abide till that i see him under his shield
and betwixt them and the city that goodly lord said $beaumains$ would i fain see ah #fool# said she thou wert better flee betimes
why said $beaumains$ an he be such a $black_knight$ as #ye# make him he will not set upon me with all his men or with his five hundred #knight#
for an there come no more but one at once i shall him not fail whilst my life lasteth fie fie said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that ever such a stinking knave should blow such a boast
$damosel_of_the_lake$ he said #ye# are to blame so to #rebuke# me for i had liefer do five battles than so to be rebuked let him come and then let him do his worst
sir she said i #marvel# what thou art and of what kin thou art come boldly thou speakest and boldly thou hast done that have i seen therefore i pray thee save thyself an thou mayest for thy horse and thou have had great travail and i dread we dwell over long from the #siege# for it is but hence seven mile and all perilous passages we are passed save all only this passage and here i dread me sore lest #ye# shall catch some #hurt# therefore i would #ye# were hence that #ye# were not bruised nor #hurt# with this strong $black_knight$
but i let you #wit# that sir $persant$ of inde is nothing of might nor strength unto the $black_knight$ that laid the #siege# about my #lady#
as for that said sir $beaumains$ be it as it be may for sithen i am come so #nigh# this $black_knight$
i will prove his might or i depart from him and else i shall be shamed an i now withdraw me from him
and therefore $damosel_of_the_lake$ have #ye# no doubt by the grace of god i shall so deal with this $black_knight$ that within two hours after noon i shall deliver him
and then shall we come to the #siege# by daylight $o_jesu$ #marvel# have i said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ what manner a man
#ye# be for it may never be otherwise but that #ye# be come of a noble blood for so foul nor shamefully did never woman rule a $black_knight$ as i have done you and ever courteously #ye# have suffered me and that came never but of a gentle blood
$damosel_of_the_lake$ said $beaumains$ a $black_knight$ may little do that may not suffer a $damosel_of_the_lake$ for whatsomever #ye# said unto me i took #none# heed to your words for the more #ye# said the more #ye# angered me and my wrath i wreaked upon them that i had ado withal
and therefore all the missaying that #ye# missaid me furthered me in my battle and caused me to think to show and prove myself at the end what i was for peradventure though i had meat in $king_arthur_s_court$ #kitchen# yet i might have had meat enough in other places but all that i did it for to prove and assay my friends and that shall be known another #day# and whether that i be a #gentleman# born or #none# i let you #wit# fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ i have done you #gentleman# service and peradventure better service yet
will i do or i depart from you alas she said fair $beaumains$ forgive me all that i have missaid or done against thee
with all my heart said he i forgive it you for #ye# did nothing but as #ye# should do for all your evil words pleased me and $damosel_of_the_lake$
said $beaumains$ since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me #wit# #ye# well it gladdeth my heart greatly and now meseemeth there is no $black_knight$ living
but i am able enough for him chapter xii how $beaumains$ fought with sir $persant$ of inde and made him to be yielden
with this sir $persant$ of inde had espied them as they hoved in the field and knightly he sent to them whether he came in #war# or in #peace#
say to thy lord said $beaumains$ i take no #force# but whether as him list himself so the #messenger# went again unto sir $persant$ and told him all his #answer#
and $beaumains$ saw him and made him ready and there they met with all that ever their horses might run and brast their spears either in three pieces and their horses rushed so together that both their horses fell dead to the earth and lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them and drew their swords and gave many great #stroke# that sometime they hurtled together that they fell grovelling on the ground
thus they fought two hours and more that their shields and their hauberks were all forhewen and in many steads they were wounded
so at the last sir $beaumains$ smote him through the cost of the body and then he retrayed him here and there and knightly maintained his battle long time
and at the last though him loath were $beaumains$ smote sir $persant$ above upon the #helm# that he fell grovelling to the earth and then he leapt upon him overthwart and unlaced his #helm# to have slain him
well then will i have ado with him to the utterance and so he purveyed him and rode against him then sir $persant$ yielded him and asked him mercy
with that came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and prayed to save his life i will well for it were pity this noble $black_knight$ should die
that slew my brother the $black_knight$ at the black thorn he was a full noble $black_knight$ his name was sir percard
also i am sure that #ye# are he that won mine other brother the green $black_knight$ his name was sir pertolepe
gramercy said $persant$ gentle $black_knight$ and $damosel_of_the_lake$ for certainly now i wot well it was #ye# also #ye# won my brother the red $black_knight$ sir perimones
and now since #ye# have won these this shall i do for to please you #ye# shall have homage and fealty of me and an hundred #knight# to be always at your commandment to go and ride where #ye# will command us
and so they went unto sir $persant$ #pavilion# and drank the wine and ate spices and afterward sir $persant$ made him to #rest# upon a #bed# until supper time and after supper to #bed# again
when $beaumains$ was abed sir $persant$ had a #lady# a fair daughter of eighteen year of #age# and there he called her unto him and charged her and commanded her upon his blessing to go unto the $black_knight$ #bed# and lie down by his side and make him no strange #cheer# but good #cheer# and take him in thine #arm# and kiss him and look that this be done i charge you as #ye# will have my love and my good will
so sir $persant$ daughter did as her father bade her and so she went unto sir $beaumains$ #bed# and privily she dispoiled her and laid her down by him
and then he awoke and saw her and asked her what she was sir she said i am sir $persant$ daughter that by the commandment of my father am come hither
god defend said he that i should defoil you to do sir $persant$ such a shame therefore fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ arise out of this #bed# or else i will
be #ye# a maid or a #wife# said he sir she said i am a clean #maiden# sir she said i came not to you by mine own will but as i was commanded
and so he kissed her and so she departed and came unto sir $persant$ her father and told him all how she had sped
alas said sir $beaumains$ i were a shameful $black_knight$ an i would do your father any disworship truly said sir $persant$ whatsomever he be he is come of a noble blood
and so we leave them there till on the morn chapter xiii of the goodly communication between sir $persant$ and $beaumains$ and how he told him that his name was sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and so on the morn the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and sir $beaumains$ heard mass and #brake# their fast and so took their leave
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said $persant$ whitherward are #ye# #way# leading this $black_knight$ sir she said this $black_knight$ is going to the #siege# that besiegeth my sister in the castle dangerous
ah ah said $persant$ that is the $black_knight$ of the red laund the which is the most perilous $black_knight$ that i know now living and
god save you said he to $beaumains$ from that $black_knight$ for he doth great wrong to that #lady# and that is great pity for she is one of the fairest #lady# of the world and meseemeth that your $damosel_of_the_lake$ is her sister is not your name $dame_linet$
a man that is without mercy and men say that he hath seven men strength said he yea sir said she and my #lady# my sister name is $lady_dame_lionesse$
now shall i tell you said sir $persant$ this red $black_knight$ of the red laund hath lain long at the #siege# well #nigh# this two years and many times he might have had her an he had
would but he prolongeth the time to this intent for to have sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to do battle with him or sir $tristram_de_liones$ or sir $lamorak_de_galis$ or $sir_gawaine$ and this is his tarrying so long at the #siege#
now my lord sir $persant$ of inde said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ i require you that #ye# will make this #gentleman# $black_knight$ or ever he fight with the red $black_knight$
i will with all my heart said sir $persant$ an it please him to take the order of knighthood of so simple a man as i am
sir said $beaumains$ i thank you for your good will for i am better sped for certainly the noble $black_knight$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ made me $black_knight$
ah said sir $persant$ of a more renowned $black_knight$ might #ye# not be made $black_knight$ for of all #knight# he may be called chief of knighthood and so all the world saith
that betwixt three #knight# is departed clearly knighthood that is $launcelot_du_lake$ sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ these bear now the renown
there be many other #knight# as sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and sir safere his brother also sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ his brother also sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $ector_de_maris$ and sir percivale de galis these and many more be noble #knight# but there be #none# that pass the three above said therefore god speed you well said sir $persant$ for an #ye# may match the red $black_knight$ #ye# shall be called the fourth of the world
i came of good men for i dare say my father was a noble man and so that #ye# will keep it in close and
sir said $beaumains$ i would fain be of good fame and of knighthood and i let you #wit# this $damosel_of_the_lake$ i will tell you of what kin i am
truly then said he my name is $gareth_of_orkney$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ lot was my father and my #mother# is $king_arthur_s_court$ sister her name is dame morgawse and $sir_gawaine$ is my brother and sir agravaine and sir $gaheris$ and i am the youngest of them all
we will not discover you said they both till #ye# command us by the faith we owe unto god and yet wot not $king_arthur_s_court$ nor $sir_gawaine$ what i am
how the #lady# that was besieged had word from her sister how she had brought a $black_knight$ to fight for her and what battles he had achieved
so the book saith that the #lady# that was besieged had word of her sister coming by the dwarf and a $black_knight$ with her and how he had passed all the perilous passages
he is a noble $black_knight$ truly madam said the dwarf and but a young man but he is as likely a man as ever #ye# saw any
chapter xiv what manner a man is he said the #lady# what is he said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and of what kin is he come and of whom was he made $black_knight$
madam said the dwarf he is the $king_arthur_s_court$ son of $king_lot_of_orkney$ but his name i will not tell you as at this time but #wit# #ye# well of sir $launcelot_du_lake$
was he made $black_knight$ for of #none# other would he be made $black_knight$ and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ named him $beaumains$ how escaped he said the #lady# from the brethren of $persant$
ah said she they were good #knight# but they were murderers the one hight gherard le $breuse_saunce_pite$ and the other $black_knight$ hight sir arnold le $breuse_saunce_pite$
then madam he recountered with the $black_knight$ and slew him in plain battle and so he took his horse and his armour and fought with the green $black_knight$ and won him in plain battle and in like wise he served the red $black_knight$ and after in the same wise he served the blue $black_knight$ and won him in plain battle
then said the #lady# he hath overcome sir $persant$ of inde one of the noblest #knight# of the world and the dwarf said he hath won all the four brethren and slain the $black_knight$ and yet he did more to #fore# he overthrew sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and left him #nigh# dead upon the ground also he did a great battle with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and there they departed on even hands and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ made him $black_knight$
dwarf said the #lady# i am glad of these tidings therefore go thou in an hermitage of mine hereby and there shalt thou bear with thee of my wine in two flagons of silver they are of two gallons and also two cast of bread with fat venison baked and dainty fowls and a cup of gold here
i deliver thee that is rich and precious and bear all this to mine hermitage and put it in the hermit hands
and sithen go thou unto my sister and greet her well and commend me unto that gentle $black_knight$ and pray him to eat and to drink and make him strong and say #ye# him
i thank him of his courtesy and goodness that he would take upon him such labour for me that never did him bounty nor courtesy
also pray him that he be of good heart and courage for he shall meet with a full noble $black_knight$ but he is neither of bounty courtesy nor gentleness for he attendeth unto nothing but to murder and that is the #cause# i cannot praise him nor love him
so this dwarf departed and came to sir $persant$ where he found the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ and sir $beaumains$ and there he told them all as #ye# have heard and then they took their leave but sir $persant$ took an ambling hackney and conveyed them on their #way# and then beleft them to god and so within a little while they came to that hermitage and there they drank the wine and ate the venison and the fowls baken
and so when they had repasted them well the dwarf returned again with his vessel unto the castle again and there met with him the red $black_knight$ of the red launds and asked him from whence that he came and where he had been
sir said the dwarf i have been with my #lady# sister of this castle and she hath been at $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and brought a $black_knight$ with her
then i account her travail but lost for though she had brought with her sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $lamorak_de_galis$ or $sir_gawaine$ i would think myself good enough for them all
it may well be said the dwarf but this $black_knight$ hath passed all the perilous passages and slain the $black_knight$ and other two more and won the green $black_knight$ the red $black_knight$ and the blue $black_knight$
madam he said as a noble $black_knight$ should first he slew two brethren at a passage of a water then is he one of these four that i have afore rehearsed
he is #none# of those said the dwarf but he is a $king_arthur_s_court$ son what is his name said the red $black_knight$ of the red launds
that will i not tell you said the dwarf but sir $kay_the_seneschal$ upon scorn named him $beaumains$ i care not said the $black_knight$ what $black_knight$ so ever he be for i shall soon deliver him
and if i ever match him he shall have a shameful death as many other have had that were pity said the dwarf and it is #marvel# that #ye# make such shameful #war# upon noble #knight#
how the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and $beaumains$ came to the #siege# and came to a sycamore tree and there $beaumains$ blew a horn and then the $black_knight$ of the red launds came to fight with him
now leave we the $black_knight$ and the dwarf and speak we of $beaumains$ that all night lay in the hermitage and upon the morn he and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ heard their mass and #brake# their fast
and then they took their horses and rode throughout a fair forest and then they came to a plain and saw where were many #pavilion# and tents and a fair castle and there was much smoke and great noise and when they came near the #siege# sir $beaumains$ espied upon great trees as he rode how there hung full goodly armed #knight# by the #neck# and their shields about their #neck# with their swords and gilt spurs upon their heels and so there hung #nigh# a forty #knight# shamefully with full rich #arm#
fair sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ abate not your #cheer# for all this sight for #ye# must courage yourself or else #ye# be all shent for all these #knight# came hither to this #siege# to rescue my sister $lady_dame_lionesse$ and when the red $black_knight$ of the red launds had overcome them he put them to this shameful death without mercy and pity
chapter xv then sir $beaumains$ abated his #countenance# and said what meaneth this and in the same wise he will serve you but if you quit you the better
now $o_jesu$ defend me said $beaumains$ from such a villainous death and shenship of #arm# for rather than i should so be faren withal i would rather be slain manly in plain battle
so were #ye# better said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for trust not in him is no courtesy but all goeth to the death or shameful murder and that is pity for he is a full likely man well made of body and a full noble $black_knight$ of prowess and a lord of great #land# and possessions
truly said $beaumains$ he may well be a good $black_knight$ but he useth shameful customs and it is #marvel# that he endureth so long that #none# of the noble #knight# of my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ have not dealt with him
and then they rode to the dykes and saw them double dyked with full warlike walls and there were lodged many great lords #nigh# the walls and there was great noise of minstrelsy and the sea beat upon the one side of the walls where were many ships and mariners noise with hale and how
and also there was fast by a sycamore tree and there hung an horn the greatest that ever they saw of an elephant bone and this $black_knight$ of the red launds had hanged it up there that if there came any errant $black_knight$ he must blow that horn and then will he make him ready and come to him to do battle
not the horn till it be high noon for now it is about prime and now increaseth his might that as men say he hath seven men strength
ah fie for shame fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ say #ye# never so more to me for an he were as good a $black_knight$ as ever was i shall never fail him in his most might for either i will win worship worshipfully or die knightly in the field
and therewith he spurred his horse straight to the sycamore tree and blew so the horn eagerly that all the #siege# and the castle rang thereof
and then there leapt out #knight# out of their tents and #pavilion# and they within the castle looked over the walls and out at windows
then the red $black_knight$ of the red launds armed him hastily and two barons set on his spurs upon his heels and all was blood red his armour spear and shield
and an earl buckled his #helm# upon his #head# and then they brought him a red spear and a red steed and so he rode into a little vale under the castle that all that were in the castle and at the #siege# might behold the battle
but sir i pray you said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ blow #ye# chapter xvi how the two #knight# met together and of their talking and how they began their battle
sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ unto sir $beaumains$ look #ye# be glad and light for yonder is your deadly #enemy# and at yonder window is my #lady# my sister $lady_dame_lionesse$
she beseemeth afar the fairest #lady# that ever i looked upon and truly he said i ask no better quarrel than now for to do battle for truly she shall be my #lady# and for her i will fight
and ever he looked up to the window with glad #countenance# and the $lady_dame_lionesse$ made curtsey to him down to the earth with holding up both their hands
with that the red $black_knight$ of the red launds called to sir $beaumains$ leave sir $black_knight$ thy looking and behold me i counsel thee for i warn thee
where said $beaumains$ yonder said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and pointed with her finger that is truth said $beaumains$ well she is my #lady# and for her i have done many strong battles
if thou have so done said $beaumains$ meseemeth it was but waste labour for she loveth #none# of thy fellowship and thou to love that loveth not thee is but great folly
for an i understood that she were not glad of my coming i would be advised or i did battle for her
and therefore #wit# thou well thou red $black_knight$ of the red launds i love her and will rescue her or else to die
sayst thou that said the red $black_knight$ meseemeth thou ought of reason to be #ware# by yonder #knight# that thou sawest hang upon yonder trees
fie for shame said $beaumains$ that ever thou shouldest say or do so evil for in that thou shamest thyself and knighthood and thou mayst be sure there will no #lady# love thee that knoweth thy wicked customs
but i understand by the besieging of this castle she may forbear thy fellowship and now thou weenest that the sight of these hanged #knight# should fear me
that shameful sight causeth me to have courage and hardiness against thee more than i would have had against thee an thou wert a well ruled $black_knight$
nay truly not so make thee ready said the red $black_knight$ of the red launds and talk no longer with me
then sir $beaumains$ bade the $damosel_of_the_lake$ go from him and then they put their spears in their #rest# and came together with all their might that they had both and either smote other in midst of their shields that the paitrelles surcingles and cruppers brast and fell to the earth both and the reins of their bridles in their hands and so they lay a great while sore astonied that all that were in the castle and in the #siege# weened their #neck# had been broken and then many a stranger and other said the strange $black_knight$ was a big man and a noble jouster for or
now we saw never no $black_knight$ match the red $black_knight$ of the red launds thus they said both within the castle and without
then lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them and drew their swords and ran together like two fierce lions and either gave other such #buffet# upon their #helm# that they reeled backward both two strides and then they recovered both and hewed great pieces off their harness and their shields that a great part fell into the fields
how after long fighting $beaumains$ overcame the $black_knight$ and would have slain him but at the request of the lords he saved his life and made him to yield him to the #lady#
and then thus they fought till it was past noon and never would stint till at the last they lacked wind both and then they stood wagging and scattering panting blowing and bleeding that all that beheld them for the most part wept for pity
chapter #xvii# so when they had rested them a while they yede to battle again tracing racing foining as two boars
and at some time they took their run as it had been two rams and hurtled together that sometime they fell grovelling to the earth and at some time they were so amazed that either took other sword instead of his own
might know whether was like to win the battle and their armour was so forhewn that men might see their naked sides and in other places they were naked but ever the naked places they did defend
and the red $black_knight$ was a wily $black_knight$ of #war# and his wily fighting taught sir $beaumains$ to be wise but he abought it full sore or he did espy his fighting
and thus by assent of them both they granted either other to #rest# and so they set them down upon two mole hills there beside the fighting place and either of them unlaced his #helm# and took the cold wind for either of their #page# was fast by them to come when they called to unlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment
and then when sir $beaumains$ #helm# was off he looked up to the window and there he saw the fair $lady_dame_lionesse$ and she made him such #countenance# that his heart waxed light and jolly and therewith he bade the red $black_knight$ of the red launds make him ready and let us do the battle to the utterance
i will well said the $black_knight$ and then they laced up their #helm# and their #page# avoided and they stepped together and fought freshly but the red $black_knight$ of the red launds awaited him and at an overthwart smote him within the hand that his sword fell out of his hand and yet he gave him another #buffet# upon the #helm# that he fell grovelling to the earth and the red $black_knight$ fell over him for to hold him down
thus they endured till evensong time that there was #none# that beheld them then cried the #maiden# $dame_linet$ on high sir $beaumains$ where is thy courage become
when sir $beaumains$ heard her say so he abraid up with a great might and gat him upon his feet and lightly he leapt to his sword and gripped it in his hand and doubled his pace unto the red $black_knight$ and there they fought a new battle together
but sir $beaumains$ then doubled his #stroke# and smote so thick that he smote the sword out of his hand and then he smote him upon the #helm# that he fell to the earth and sir $beaumains$ fell upon him and unlaced his #helm# to have slain him and then he yielded him and asked mercy and said with a loud voice noble $black_knight$ i yield me to thy mercy
then sir $beaumains$ bethought him upon the #knight# that he had made to be hanged shamefully and then he said i may not with my worship save thy life for the shameful deaths that thou hast caused many full good #knight# to die
sir said the red $black_knight$ of the red launds hold your hand and #ye# shall know the #cause# why i put them to so shameful a death
alas my #lady# my sister beholdeth thee and she sobbeth and weepeth that maketh mine heart heavy say on said sir $beaumains$
sir i loved once a #lady# a fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ and she had her brother slain and she said it was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or else $sir_gawaine$ and she prayed me as that i loved her heartily that i would make her a promise by the faith of my knighthood for to labour daily in #arm# unto i met with one of them and all that i might overcome i should put them unto a villainous death and this is the #cause# that i have put all these #knight# to death and so i ensured her to do all the villainy unto $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight# and that i should take vengeance upon all these #knight#
and sir now i will thee tell that every #day# my strength increaseth till noon and all this time have i seven men strength
how the $black_knight$ yielded him and how $beaumains$ made him to go unto $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and to cry sir $launcelot_du_lake$ mercy
then came there many earls and barons and noble #knight# and prayed that $black_knight$ to save his life and take him to your #prisoner#
and all they fell upon their knees and prayed him of mercy and that he would save his life and sir they all said it were fairer of him to take homage and fealty and let him hold his #land# of you than for to slay him by his death #ye# shall have #none# advantage and his misdeeds that be done may not be undone and therefore he shall make amends to all parties and we all will become your men and do you homage and fealty
nevertheless he hath done passing ill and shamefully but insomuch all that he did was at a #lady# request i blame him the less and so for your sake i will release him that he shall have his life upon this covenant that he go within the castle and yield him there to the #lady# and if she will forgive and quit him i will well with this he make her amends of all the trespass he hath done against her and her #land#
and also when that is done that #ye# go unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and there that #ye# ask sir $launcelot_du_lake$ mercy and $sir_gawaine$ for the evil will #ye# have had against them
sir said the red $black_knight$ of the red launds all this will i do as #ye# command and siker assurance and borrows
and so then when the assurance was made he made his homage and fealty and all those earls and barons with him
and then the #maiden# $dame_linet$ came to sir $beaumains$ and unarmed him and searched his #wound# and stinted his blood and in likewise she did to the red $black_knight$ of the red launds
and there they sojourned ten #day# in their tents and the red $black_knight$ made his lords and servants to do all the pleasure that they might unto sir $beaumains$
and so within a while the red $black_knight$ of the red launds yede unto the castle and put him in her grace
and so she received him upon sufficient surety so all her #hurt# were well restored of all that she could complain
and then he departed unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and there openly the red $black_knight$ of the red launds put him in the mercy of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and $sir_gawaine$ and there he told openly how he was overcome and by whom and also he told all the battles from the beginning unto the ending
$o_jesu$ mercy said $king_arthur_s_court$ and $sir_gawaine$ we #marvel# much of what blood he is come for he is a noble $black_knight$
chapter xviii fair lords said $beaumains$ #wit# you well i am full loath to slay this $black_knight$ #ye# shall have have #ye# no #marvel# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for #ye#
right well #wit# that he is come of a full noble blood and as for his might and hardiness there be but few now living that is so mighty as he is and so noble of prowess
it seemeth by you said $king_arthur_s_court$ that #ye# know his name and from whence he is come and of what blood he is
i suppose i do so said $launcelot_du_lake$ or else i would not have given him the order of knighthood but he gave me such charge at that time that i should never discover him until he required me or else it be known openly by some other
how $beaumains$ came to the #lady# and when he came to the castle the gates were closed against him and of the words that the #lady# said to him
shall chapter xix now turn we unto sir $beaumains$ that desired of $dame_linet$ that he might see her sister his #lady#
sir she said i would fain #ye# saw her then sir $beaumains$ all armed him and took his horse and his spear and rode straight unto the castle
and when he came to the gate he found there many men armed and pulled up the drawbridge and drew the port close
then marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter and then he looked up to the window and there he saw the fair lionesse that said on high
go thy #way# sir $beaumains$ for as yet thou shalt not have wholly my love unto the time that thou be called one of the number of the worthy #knight#
alas fair #lady# said $beaumains$ i have not deserved that #ye# should show me this strangeness and i had weened that i should have right good #cheer# with you and unto my power i have deserved thank and
and therefore go labour in worship this twelvemonth and then thou shalt hear new tidings well i am sure i have bought your love with part of the best blood within my body
for #wit# you well your great travail nor good love shall not be lost for i consider your great travail and labour your bounty and your goodness as me ought to do
and therefore go on your #way# and look that #ye# be of good comfort for all shall be for your worship and for the best and perdy a twelvemonth will soon be done and trust me fair $black_knight$ i shall be true to you and never to betray you but to my death i shall love you and #none# other
and therewithal she turned her from the window and sir $beaumains$ rode awayward from the castle making great dole and so he rode here and there and wist not where he rode till it was dark night
fair courteous $black_knight$ said $lady_dame_lionesse$ be not displeased nor over hasty and then it happened him to come to a poor man house and there he was harboured all that night
and so upon the morrow he took his horse and rode until underne and then he came to a broad water and thereby was a great lodge and there he alighted to sleep and laid his #head# upon the shield and betook his horse to the dwarf and commanded him to watch all night
now turn we to the #lady# of the same castle that thought much upon $beaumains$ and then she called unto her sir $gringamore$ her brother and prayed him in all manner as he loved her heartily that he would ride after sir $beaumains$ and ever have #ye# wait upon him till #ye# may find him sleeping for i am sure in his heaviness he will alight down in some place and lie him down to sleep and therefore have #ye# your wait upon him and in the priviest manner #ye# can take his dwarf and go #ye# your #way# with him as fast as ever #ye# may or sir $beaumains$ awake
for my sister $dame_linet$ telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come and what is his right name
and the meanwhile i and my sister will ride unto your castle to await when #ye# bring with you the dwarf
but sir $beaumains$ had no #rest# but wallowed and writhed for the love of the #lady# of the castle and then when #ye# have brought him unto your castle i will have him in examination myself
unto the time that i know what is his right name and of what kindred he is come shall i never be merry at my heart
and so he rode all the other #day# and the night till that he found sir $beaumains$ lying by a water and his #head# upon his shield for to sleep
and then when he saw sir $beaumains$ fast asleep he came stilly stalking behind the dwarf and plucked him fast under his #arm# and so he rode away with him as fast as ever he might unto his own castle
sister said sir $gringamore$ all this shall be done after your intent and this sir $gringamore$ #arm# were all black and that to him longeth
but ever as he rode with the dwarf toward his castle he cried unto his lord and prayed him of #help#
and therewith awoke sir $beaumains$ and up he leapt lightly and saw where sir $gringamore$ rode his #way# with the dwarf and so sir $gringamore$ rode out of his sight
then sir $beaumains$ put on his #helm# anon and buckled his shield and took his horse and rode after him all that ever he might ride through marshes and fields and great dales that many times his horse and he plunged over the #head# in deep mires for he knew not the #way# but took the gainest #way# in that woodness that many times he was like to perish
and at the last him happened to come to a fair green #way# and there he met with a poor man of the country whom he saluted and asked him whether he met not with a $black_knight$ upon a black horse and all black harness a little dwarf sitting behind him with heavy #cheer#
sir said the poor man here by me came sir $gringamore$ the $black_knight$ with such a dwarf mourning as #ye# say and therefore i rede you not follow him for he is one of the periloust #knight# of the world and
his castle is here #nigh# hand but two mile therefore we advise you ride not after sir $gringamore$ but if #ye# owe him good will
chapter #xx# how sir $beaumains$ rode after to rescue his dwarf and came into the castle where he was so leave we sir $beaumains$ riding toward the castle and speak we of sir $gringamore$ and the dwarf
anon as the dwarf was come to the castle $lady_dame_lionesse$ and $dame_linet$ her sister asked the dwarf where was his #master# born and of what lineage he was come
and but if thou tell me said $lady_dame_lionesse$ thou shalt never escape this castle but ever here to be #prisoner#
as for that said the dwarf i fear not greatly to tell his name and of what kin he is come
well he is a $king_arthur_s_court$ son and his #mother# is sister to $king_arthur_s_court$ and he is brother to the good $black_knight$ $sir_gawaine$ and his name is sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and now i have told you his right name i pray you fair #lady# let me go to my lord again for he will never out of this country until that he have me again
and if he be angry he will do much harm or that he be stint and work you wrack in this country
and so they washed and went to meat and made them merry and well at ease and because the $lady_dame_lionesse$ of the castle was there they made great joy
truly madam said $dame_linet$ unto her sister well may he be a $king_arthur_s_court$ son for he hath many good tatches on him for he is courteous and mild and the most suffering man that ever i met withal
for i dare say there was never gentlewoman reviled man in so foul a manner as i have rebuked him and at all times he gave me goodly and meek #answer# again
and as they sat thus talking there came sir $gareth_of_orkney$ in at the gate with an angry #countenance# and his sword drawn in his hand and cried aloud that all the castle might hear it saying thou traitor sir $gringamore$ deliver me my dwarf again or by the faith that i owe to the order of knighthood i shall do thee all the harm that i can
then sir $gringamore$ looked out at a window and said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ leave thy boasting words for thou gettest not thy dwarf again
thou coward $black_knight$ said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ bring him with thee and come and do battle with me and win him and take him
#wit# you as for that threatening said sir $gringamore$ be it as it be may we will go to dinner so will i do said sir $gringamore$ an me list but for all thy great words thou gettest him not
ah fair brother said $lady_dame_lionesse$ i would he had his dwarf again for i would he were not wroth for now he hath told me all my desire
and also brother he hath done much for me and delivered me from the red $black_knight$ of the red launds and therefore brother i owe him my service afore all #knight# living
i keep no more of the dwarf and #wit# #ye# well that i love him before all other and full fain
i would speak with him but in nowise i would that he wist what i were but that i were another strange #lady#
and right therewithal he went down unto sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and said sir i cry you mercy and all that i have misdone i will amend it at your will
and therefore i pray you that #ye# would alight and take such #cheer# as i can make you in this castle
well said sir $gringamore$ sithen i know now your will i will obey now unto him shall i have my dwarf said sir $gareth_of_orkney$
yea sir and all the pleasaunce that i can make you for as soon as your dwarf told me what #ye# were and of what blood #ye# are come and what noble deeds #ye# have done in these marches then i repented of my deeds
and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ alighted and there came his dwarf and took his horse my fellow said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ i have had many adventures for thy sake
and so sir $gringamore$ took him by the hand and led him into the hall where his own #wife# was chapter xxi
how sir $gareth_of_orkney$ otherwise called $beaumains$ came to the presence of his #lady# and how they took acquaintance and of their love
$lady_dame_lionesse$ arrayed like a princess and there she made him passing good #cheer# and he her again and they had goodly language and lovely #countenance# together
and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ thought many times $o_jesu$ would that the #lady# of the castle perilous were so fair as she was
and ever the more sir $gareth_of_orkney$ beheld that #lady# the more he loved her and so he burned in love that he was past himself in his reason and forth toward night they yede unto supper and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ might not eat for his love was so hot that he wist not where he was
all these looks espied sir $gringamore$ and then at after supper he called his sister $lady_dame_lionesse$ into a chamber and said fair sister i have well espied your #countenance# betwixt you and this $black_knight$ and i will sister that
he is a full noble $black_knight$ and if #ye# can make him to abide here i will do him all the pleasure that i can
and then came forth there were all manner of games and plays of dancing and singing #ye# #wit# for an #ye# were better than #ye# are #ye# were well bywaryd upon him
fair brother said $lady_dame_lionesse$ i understand well that the $black_knight$ is good and come he is of a noble house
notwithstanding i will assay him better howbeit i am most beholden to him of any earthly man for he hath had great labour for my love and passed many a dangerous passage
right so sir $gringamore$ went unto sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and said sir make #ye# good #cheer# for #ye# shall have #none# other #cause# for this #lady# my sister is yours at all times her worship saved for #wit#
#ye# well she loveth you as well as #ye# do her and better if better may be an i wist that said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ there lived not a gladder man than i would be
#ye# shall sojourn with me and this #lady# shall be with us daily and nightly to make you all the #cheer# that she can
upon my worship said sir $gringamore$ trust unto my promise and as long as it liketh you i will well said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ for i have promised to be #nigh# this country this twelvemonth
and well i am sure $king_arthur_s_court$ and other noble #knight# will find me where that i am within this twelvemonth
and then the noble $black_knight$ sir $gareth_of_orkney$ went unto the $lady_dame_lionesse$ which he then much loved and kissed her many times and either made great joy of other
for i shall be sought and found if that i be alive and there she promised him her love certainly to love him and #none# other the #day# of her life
then this $lady_dame_lionesse$ by the assent of her brother told sir $gareth_of_orkney$ all the truth what she was and how she was the same #lady# that he did battle for and how she was #lady# of the castle perilous and there she told him how she caused her brother to take away his dwarf for this #cause# to know the certainty what was your name and of what kin #ye# were come
how at night came an armed $black_knight$ and fought with sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and he sore #hurt# in the thigh smote off the $black_knight$ #head#
printed by $william_caxton$ as part of chap xxii chapter xxii and then she let fetch to #fore# him $dame_linet$ the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that had ridden with him many wildsome #way#
then was sir $gareth_of_orkney$ more gladder than he was to #fore# and then they troth plight each other to love and never to fail whiles their life lasteth
and so they burnt both in love that they were accorded to abate their lusts secretly and there $lady_dame_lionesse$ counselled sir $gareth_of_orkney$ to sleep in #none# other place but in the hall
and there she promised him to come to his #bed# a little afore midnight this counsel was not so privily kept
but it was understood for they were but young both and tender of #age# and had not used #none# such crafts to #fore#
wherefore the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ was a little displeased and she thought her sister $lady_dame_lionesse$ was a little over hasty that she might not abide the time of her marriage and for saving their worship she thought to abate their hot lusts
and so she let ordain by her subtle crafts that they had not their intents neither with other as in their delights until they were married
and so it passed on at after supper was made clean avoidance that every lord and #lady# should go unto his #rest#
but sir $gareth_of_orkney$ said plainly he would go no farther than the hall for in such places he said was convenient for an errant $black_knight$ to take his #rest# in and so there were ordained great couches and thereon feather #bed# and there laid him down to sleep and within a while came $lady_dame_lionesse$ wrapped in a #mantle# furred with ermine and laid her down beside sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and then he looked afore him and there he apperceived and saw come an armed $black_knight$ with many lights about him and this $black_knight$ had a long gisarm in his hand and made grim #countenance# to smite him
when sir $gareth_of_orkney$ saw him come in that wise he leapt out of his #bed# and gat in his hand his sword and leapt straight toward that $black_knight$
and when the $black_knight$ saw sir $gareth_of_orkney$ come so fiercely upon him he smote him with a foin through the thick of the thigh that the #wound# was a shaftmon broad and had cut a two many veins and sinews
and therewithal sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him upon the #helm# such a #buffet# that he fell grovelling and then he leapt over him and unlaced his #helm# and smote off his #head# from the body
and then he bled so fast that he might not stand but so he laid him down upon his #bed# and there he swooned and lay as he had been dead
and therewithal he began to kiss her then $lady_dame_lionesse$ cried aloud that her brother sir $gringamore$ heard and came down
and when he saw sir $gareth_of_orkney$ so shamefully wounded he was sore displeased and said i am shamed that this noble $black_knight$ is thus honoured
sir said sir $gringamore$ how may this be that #ye# be here and this noble $black_knight$ wounded brother she said i can not tell you for it was not done by me nor by mine assent
for he is my lord and i am his and he must be mine husband therefore my brother i will that #ye# #wit#
sister said sir $gringamore$ and i will that #ye# #wit# it and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ both that it was never done by me nor by my assent that this unhappy deed was done
i shame me not to be with him nor to do him all the pleasure that i can and there they staunched his bleeding as well as they might and great #sorrow# made sir $gringamore$ and $lady_dame_lionesse$
and forthwithal came $dame_linet$ and took up the #head# in the sight of them all and anointed it with an ointment thereas it was smitten off and in the same wise she did to the other part thereas the #head# stuck and then she set it together and it stuck as fast as ever it did
all this saw sir $gringamore$ and $lady_dame_lionesse$ and so did sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and well he espied that it was the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$
and the $black_knight$ arose lightly up and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ put him in her chamber that rode with him through the perilous passages
my lord $gareth_of_orkney$ said $dame_linet$ all that i have done i will avow and all that i have done shall be for your honour and worship and to us all
and so within a while sir $gareth_of_orkney$ was #nigh# whole and waxed light and jocund and sang danced and gamed and he and $lady_dame_lionesse$ were so hot in burning love that they made their covenant at the tenth night after that she should come to his #bed#
ah well $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ i weened #ye# would not have done as #ye# have done and because he was wounded afore he laid his armour and his sword
how the said $black_knight$ came again the next night and was beheaded again and how at the feast of pentecost all the #knight# that sir $gareth_of_orkney$ had overcome came and yielded them to $king_arthur_s_court$
#nigh# his #bed# side chapter xxiii right as she promised she came and she was not so soon in his #bed#
she warned sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and lightly through the good #help# of $lady_dame_lionesse$ he was armed and they hurtled together with great ire and malice all about the hall and there was great light as it had been the number of twenty torches both before and behind so that sir $gareth_of_orkney$ strained him so that his old #wound# brast again a bleeding but he was hot and courageous and took no keep but with his great #force# he struck down that $black_knight$ and voided his #helm# and struck off his #head#
and when he had done so he took up all those pieces and threw them out at a window into the ditches of the castle and by this done he was so faint that unnethes he might stand for bleeding
and by when he was almost unarmed he fell in a deadly swoon on the floor and then $lady_dame_lionesse$ cried so that sir $gringamore$ heard and when he came and found sir $gareth_of_orkney$ in that plight he made great #sorrow# and there he awaked sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and gave him a drink that relieved him wonderly well but the #sorrow# that $lady_dame_lionesse$ made there may no tongue tell for she so fared with herself as she would have died
right so came this $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ before them all and she had fetched all the gobbets of the #head# that sir $gareth_of_orkney$ had thrown out at a window and there she anointed them as she had done to #fore# and set them together again
but she espied an armed $black_knight$ coming toward the #bed# therewithal then he hewed the #head# in an hundred pieces well $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ i have not deserved all this despite that #ye# do unto me
sir $black_knight$ she said i have nothing done but i will avow and all that i have done shall be to your worship and to us all
and then was sir $gareth_of_orkney$ staunched of his bleeding but the leeches said that there was no man that bare the life should heal him throughout of his #wound#
so leave we sir $gareth_of_orkney$ there with sir $gringamore$ and his sisters and turn we unto $king_arthur_s_court$ that at the next feast of pentecost held his feast and there came the green $black_knight$ with fifty #knight# and yielded them all unto $king_arthur_s_court$
and so there came the red $black_knight$ his brother and yielded him to $king_arthur_s_court$ and three score #knight# with him
also there came the blue $black_knight$ brother to them with an hundred #knight# and yielded them unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and the green $black_knight$ name was pertolepe and the red $black_knight$ name was perimones and the blue $black_knight$ name was sir $persant$ of inde
these three brethren told $king_arthur_s_court$ how they were overcome by a $black_knight$ that a $damosel_of_the_lake$ had with her and called him $beaumains$
but if they healed him that caused that #stroke# by enchantment $o_jesu$ said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i #marvel# what $black_knight$ he is and of what lineage he is come
he was with me a twelvemonth and poorly and shamefully he was fostered and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ in scorn named him $beaumains$
so right as the $king_arthur_s_court$ stood so talking with these three brethren there came sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and told the $king_arthur_s_court$ that there was come a goodly lord with six hundred #knight# with him
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ went out of carlion for there was the feast and there came to him this lord and saluted the $king_arthur_s_court$ in a goodly manner
sir he said my name is the red $black_knight$ of the red launds but my name is sir $ironside$ and sir #wit# #ye# well here i am sent to you of a $black_knight$ that is called $beaumains$ for he won me in plain battle hand for hand and so did never no $black_knight$
but he that ever had the better of me this thirty winter the which commanded to yield me to you at your will
#ye# are welcome said the $king_arthur_s_court$ for #ye# have been long a great foe to me and my #court# and now i trust to god
what will #ye# said $king_arthur_s_court$ and what is your errand i shall so entreat you that #ye# shall be my friend
sir both i and these five hundred #knight# shall always be at your summons to do you service as may lie in our powers
$o_jesu$ mercy said $king_arthur_s_court$ i am much beholden unto that $black_knight$ that hath put so his body in devoir to worship me and my #court#
and as to thee $ironside$ that art called the red $black_knight$ of the red launds thou art called a perilous $black_knight$ and if thou wilt hold of me i shall worship thee and make thee $black_knight$ of the table round but then thou must be no more a murderer
sir as to that i have promised unto sir $beaumains$ never more to use such customs for all the shameful customs that i used i did at the request of a #lady# that i loved and therefore i must go unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and unto $sir_gawaine$ and ask them forgiveness of the evil will i had unto them for all that i put to death was all only for the love of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and of $sir_gawaine$
and then he kneeled down unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and to $sir_gawaine$ and prayed them of forgiveness of his enmity that ever he had against them
they be here now said the $king_arthur_s_court$ afore thee now may #ye# say to them what #ye# will chapter xxiv how $king_arthur_s_court$ pardoned them and demanded of them where sir $gareth_of_orkney$ was
then goodly they said all at once god forgive you and we do and pray you that #ye# will tell us where we may find sir $beaumains$
fair lords said sir $ironside$ i cannot tell you for it is full hard to find him for such young #knight# as he is one when they be in their adventures be never abiding in no place
but to say the worship that the red $black_knight$ of the red launds and sir $persant$ and his brother said of $beaumains$ it was #marvel# to hear
i shall do you honour for the love of sir $beaumains$ and as soon as ever i meet with him i shall make you all upon one #day# #knight# of the table round
and as to thee sir $persant$ of inde thou hast been ever called a full noble $black_knight$ and so have ever been thy three brethren called
but i #marvel# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that i hear not of the $black_knight$ your brother he was a full noble $black_knight$
sir said pertolepe the green $black_knight$ sir $beaumains$ slew him in a recounter with his spear his name was sir percard
well my fair lords said $king_arthur_s_court$ #wit# you well that was great pity said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and so said many #knight#
for these four brethren were full well known in the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ for noble #knight# for long time they had holden #war# against the #knight# of the round table
then said pertolepe the green $black_knight$ to the $king_arthur_s_court$ at a passage of the water of mortaise there encountered sir $beaumains$ with two brethren that ever for the most part kept that passage and they were two deadly #knight# and there he slew the eldest brother in the water and smote him upon the #head# such a #buffet# that he fell down in the water and there he was drowned and his name was sir gherard le breusse and after he slew the other brother upon the #land# his name was sir arnold le breusse
chapter xxv in $william_caxton$ edition this chapter is misnumbered #xxvi# setting the numeration wrong to the end of the book
how the #queen# of $king_lot_of_orkney$ came to this feast of pentecost and $sir_gawaine$ and his brethren came to ask her blessing
and as they sat at the meat there came in the #queen# of $king_lot_of_orkney$ with #lady# and #knight# a great number
and then $sir_gawaine$ sir agravaine and $gaheris$ arose and went to her and saluted her upon their knees and asked her blessing for in fifteen year they had not seen her
so then the $king_arthur_s_court$ and they went to meat and were served in the best manner then she spake on high to her brother $king_arthur_s_court$
he was here amongst you a twelvemonth and #ye# made a #kitchen# knave of him the which is shame to you all
where have #ye# done my young son sir $gareth_of_orkney$ alas where have #ye# done my dear son that was my joy and bliss
o dear #mother# said $sir_gawaine$ i knew him not nor i said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that now me repenteth but thanked be god
he is proved a worshipful $black_knight$ as any is now living of his years and i shall never be glad till i may find him
ah brother said the #queen# unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and unto $sir_gawaine$ and to all her sons #ye# did yourself great shame when #ye# amongst you kept my son in the #kitchen# and fed him like a poor hog
#wit# i knew him not nor no more did $sir_gawaine$ nor his brethren but sithen it is so said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that he is thus gone from us all we must shape a remedy to find him
also sister meseemeth #ye# might have done me to #wit# of his coming and then an i had not done well to him #ye# might have blamed me
for when he came to this #court# he came leaning upon two men shoulders as though he might not have gone
and then he asked me three gifts and one he asked the same #day# that was that i would give him meat enough that twelvemonth and the other two gifts he asked that #day# a twelvemonth and
that was that he might have the adventure of the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ and the third was that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ should make him $black_knight$ when he desired him
and so i granted him all his desire and many in this #court# marvelled that he desired his sustenance for a twelvemonth
fair sister said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# shall right well and thereby we deemed many of us that he was not come of a noble house
sir said the #queen# of $king_lot_of_orkney$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ her brother #wit# #ye# well that i sent him unto you right well armed and horsed and worshipfully beseen of his body and gold and silver plenty to spend
it may be said the $king_arthur_s_court$ but thereof saw we #none# save that same #day# as he departed from us #knight# told me that there came a dwarf hither suddenly and brought him armour and a good horse full well and richly beseen and thereat we all had #marvel# from whence that riches came that we deemed all that he was come of men of worship
brother said the #queen# all that #ye# say i believe for ever sithen he was grown he was marvellously witted and ever he was faithful and true of his promise
but i #marvel# said she that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ did mock him and scorn him and gave him that name $beaumains$ yet sir $kay_the_seneschal$ said the #queen# named him more righteously than he weened for i dare say an he be alive he is as fair an handed man and well disposed as any is living
sir said $king_arthur_s_court$ let this language be still and by the grace of god he shall be found an he be within this seven realms and let all this pass and be merry for he is proved to be a man of worship and that is my joy
how $king_arthur_s_court$ sent for the $lady_dame_lionesse$ and how she let cry a tourney at her castle whereas came many #knight#
then said $sir_gawaine$ and his brethren unto $king_arthur_s_court$ sir an #ye# will give us leave we will go and seek our brother
nay said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that shall #ye# not need and so said sir baudwin of britain for as by our advice the $king_arthur_s_court$ shall send unto $lady_dame_lionesse$ a #messenger# and pray her that she will come to the #court# in all the haste that she may and doubt #ye# not she will come and then she may give you best counsel where #ye# shall find him
so then goodly letters were made and the #messenger# sent forth that night and #day# he went till he came unto the castle perilous
chapter #xxvi# this is well said of you said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and then the $lady_dame_lionesse$ was sent for thereas she was with sir $gringamore$ her brother and sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and when she understood this message she bade him ride on his #way# unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and she would come after in all goodly haste
then when she came to sir $gringamore$ and to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ she told them all how $king_arthur_s_court$ had sent for her
that is because of me said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ now advise me said $lady_dame_lionesse$ what shall i say and in what manner i shall rule me
my #lady# and my love said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ i pray you in no wise be #ye# aknowen where i am but well i wot
my #mother# is there and all my brethren and they will take upon them to seek me i wot well that they do
then may #ye# say this is your advice that an it like his good grace #ye# will do make a cry against the feast of the assumption of our #lady# that what $black_knight$ there proveth him best he shall wield you and all your #land#
and if so be that he be a wedded man that his #wife# shall have the degree and a coronal of gold beset with stones of virtue to the value of a thousand pound and a white gerfalcon
so $lady_dame_lionesse$ departed and came to $king_arthur_s_court$ where she was nobly received and there she was sore questioned of the $king_arthur_s_court$ and of the #queen# of $king_lot_of_orkney$
but this madam i would #ye# said and advised the $king_arthur_s_court$ when he questioned with you of me and she answered where sir $gareth_of_orkney$ was she could not tell
sir i will let cry a #tournament# that shall be done before my castle at the assumption of our #lady# and the cry shall be this that you my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ shall be there and your #knight# and i will purvey that my #knight# shall be against yours and then i am sure #ye# shall hear of sir $gareth_of_orkney$
but thus much she said unto $king_arthur_s_court$ this is well advised said $king_arthur_s_court$ and so she departed and the $king_arthur_s_court$ and she made great provision to that #tournament#
when $lady_dame_lionesse$ was come to the isle of avilion that was the same isle thereas her brother sir $gringamore$ dwelt
then she told them all how she had done and what promise she had made to $king_arthur_s_court$ alas said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ i have been so wounded with unhappiness
sithen i came into this castle that i shall not be able to do at that #tournament# like a $black_knight$ for i was never thoroughly whole since i was #hurt#
be #ye# of good #cheer# said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ for i undertake within these fifteen #day# to make #ye# whole and as lusty as ever #ye# were
and then she laid an ointment and a salve to him as it pleased to her that he was never so fresh nor so lusty
then said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ send you unto sir $persant$ of inde and assummon him and his #knight# to be here with you as they have promised
also that #ye# send unto sir $ironside$ that is the red $black_knight$ of the red launds and charge him that he be ready with you with his whole sum of #knight# and then shall #ye# be able to match with $king_arthur_s_court$ and his #knight#
so this was done and all #knight# were sent for unto the castle perilous and then the red $black_knight$ answered and said unto $lady_dame_lionesse$ and to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ madam and my lord sir $gareth_of_orkney$ #ye# shall understand that i have been at the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $persant$ of inde and his brethren and there we have done our homage as #ye# commanded us
also sir $ironside$ said i have taken upon me with sir $persant$ of inde and his brethren to hold part against my lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and the #knight# of that #court#
and this have i done for the love of my $lady_dame_lionesse$ and you my lord sir $gareth_of_orkney$ #ye# have well done said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ but #wit# you well #ye# shall be full
sore matched with the most noble #knight# of the world therefore we must purvey us of good #knight# where we may get them
and so the cry was made in england wales and scotland ireland cornwall and in all the out isles and in brittany and in many countries that at the feast of our #lady# the assumption next coming men should come to the castle perilous beside the isle of avilion and there all the #knight# that there came should have the choice whether them list to be on the one party with the #knight# of the castle or on the other party with $king_arthur_s_court$
that is well said said sir $persant$ and worshipfully and two months was to the #day# that the #tournament# should be
and so there came many good #knight# that were at their large and held them for the most part against $king_arthur_s_court$ and his #knight# of the round table and came in the side of them of the castle
for sir epinogrus was the first and he was the $king_arthur_s_court$ son of northumberland and sir $palamides_the_saracen$ was another and sir safere his brother and sir $segwarides$ his brother but they were christened and sir malegrine another and sir $brian_de_les_isles$ a noble $black_knight$ and sir grummore grummursum a good $black_knight$ of scotland and sir $king_carados$ of the dolorous tower a noble $black_knight$ and sir $turquine$ his brother and sir arnold and sir gauter two brethren good #knight# of cornwall
there came sir $tristram_de_liones$ and with him sir $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir sadok but this sir $tristram_de_liones$ was not at that time $black_knight$ of the table round but he was one of the best #knight# of the world
and so all these noble #knight# accompanied them with the #lady# of the castle and with the red $black_knight$ of the red launds but as for sir $gareth_of_orkney$ he would not take upon him more but as other #mean# #knight#
how $king_arthur_s_court$ went to the #tournament# with his #knight# and how the #lady# received him worshipfully and how the #knight# encountered
and then his nephews sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ le blanchemains and sir aglovale sir $tor$ sir percivale de galis and sir $lamorak_de_galis$
then came sir $launcelot_du_lake$ with his brethren nephews and cousins as sir $lionel$ sir $ector_de_maris$ sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir galihodin sir galihud and many more of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ blood and sir $dinadan$ sir $la_cote_male_taile$ his brother a good $black_knight$ and sir $sagramore$ a good $black_knight$ and all the most part of the round table
also there came with $king_arthur_s_court$ these #knight# the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of scotland $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens of the #land# of gore and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ and his son sir meliaganus and sir galahault the noble prince
all these #king# princes and earls barons and other noble #knight# as sir brandiles sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ sir bedivere sir meliot de logres sir petipase of winchelsea sir godelake
chapter xxvii and then there came with $king_arthur_s_court$ $sir_gawaine$ agravaine $gaheris$ his brethren all these came with $king_arthur_s_court$ and more that cannot be rehearsed
now leave we of these #king# and #knight# and let us speak of the great array that was made within the castle and about the castle for both parties
the $lady_dame_lionesse$ ordained great array upon her part for her noble #knight# for all manner of lodging and victual that came by #land# and by water that there lacked nothing for her party nor for the other but there was plenty to be had for gold and silver for $king_arthur_s_court$ and his #knight#
and then there came the harbingers from $king_arthur_s_court$ for to harbour him and his #king# dukes earls barons and #knight#
and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ prayed $lady_dame_lionesse$ and the red $black_knight$ of the red launds and sir $persant$ and his brother and sir $gringamore$ that in no wise there should #none# of them tell not his name and make no more of him than of the least $black_knight$ that there was for he said i will not be known of neither more nor less neither at the beginning neither at the ending
sir i will lend you a ring but i would pray you as you love me heartily let me have it again when the #tournament# is done for that ring increaseth my beauty much more than it is of himself
and the virtue of my ring is that that is green it will turn to red and that is red it will turn in likeness to green and that is blue it will turn to likeness of white and that is white it will turn in likeness to blue and so it will do of all manner of colours
then $lady_dame_lionesse$ said unto sir $gareth_of_orkney$ also who that beareth my ring shall lose no blood and for great love i will give you this ring
gramercy said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ mine own #lady# for this ring is passing meet for me for it will turn all manner of likeness that i am in and that shall #cause# me that i shall not be known
then sir $gringamore$ gave sir $gareth_of_orkney$ a bay courser that was a passing good horse also he gave him good armour and sure and a noble sword that sometime sir $gringamore$ father won upon an heathen tyrant
and so thus every $black_knight$ made him ready to that #tournament# and $king_arthur_s_court$ was come two #day# to #fore# the assumption of our #lady#
and there was all manner of royalty of all minstrelsy that might be found also there came #queen# $dame_guenever$ and the #queen# of $king_lot_of_orkney$ sir $gareth_of_orkney$ #mother#
and upon the assumption #day# when mass and matins were done there were heralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the field
and so there came out sir epinogrus the $king_arthur_s_court$ son of northumberland from the castle and there encountered with him sir $sagramore$ le desirous and either of them #brake# their spears to their hands
and then came in sir $palamides_the_saracen$ out of the castle and there encountered with him $sir_gawaine$ and either of them smote other so hard that both the good #knight# and their horses fell to the earth
and then came in sir safere and sir $segwarides$ brethren to sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and there encountered sir agravaine with sir safere and sir $gaheris$ encountered with sir $segwarides$
and then #knight# of either party rescued their #knight# so sir safere smote down agravaine $sir_gawaine$ brother and sir $segwarides$ sir safere brother
and sir malegrine a $black_knight$ of the castle encountered with sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ le blanchemains and there sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ gave sir malegrine a fall that he had almost broke his #neck#
then sir $brian_de_les_isles$ and grummore grummursum #knight# of the castle encountered with sir aglovale and sir $tor$ smote down sir grummore grummursum to the earth
then came in sir $king_carados$ of the dolorous tower and sir $turquine$ #knight# of the castle and there encountered with them sir percivale de galis and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that were two brethren
and there encountered sir percivale with sir $king_carados$ and either #brake# their spears unto their hands and then sir $turquine$ with sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and either of them smote down other horse and all to the earth and either parties rescued other and horsed them again
and sir arnold and sir gauter #knight# of the castle encountered with sir brandiles and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and these four #knight# encountered mightily and #brake# their spears to their hands
then came in sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir sadok and sir $dinas$ #knight# of the castle and there encountered sir $tristram_de_liones$ with sir bedivere and there sir bedivere was smitten to the earth both horse and man
chapter xxviii how the #knight# bare them in the battle and sir sadok encountered with sir petipase and there sir sadok was overthrown
then came in sir $persant$ of inde a $black_knight$ of the castle and there encountered with him sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and there he smote sir $persant$ horse and man to the earth
then came sir pertolepe from the castle and there encountered with him sir $lionel$ and there sir pertolepe the green $black_knight$ smote down sir $lionel$ brother to sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and there $uwaine_les_avoutres$ smote down sir $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ all this was marked by noble heralds who bare him best and their names
and then came into the field sir perimones the red $black_knight$ sir $persant$ brother that was a $black_knight$ of the castle and he encountered with sir $ector_de_maris$ and either smote other so hard that both their horses and they fell to the earth
and then came in the red $black_knight$ of the red launds and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ from the castle and there encountered with them sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and there the red $black_knight$ and sir $bors_de_ganis$ either smote other so hard that their spears brast and their horses fell grovelling to the earth
then sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ #brake# his spear upon sir $gareth_of_orkney$ but of that #stroke# sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ fell to the earth when sir galihodin saw that he bade sir $gareth_of_orkney$ keep him and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him to the earth
then sir galihud gat a spear to avenge his brother and in the same wise sir $gareth_of_orkney$ served him and sir $dinadan$ and his brother $la_cote_male_taile$ and sir $sagramore$ le desirous and sir dodinas le $balin_le_savage$
all these he bare down with one spear when $king_arthur_s_court$ agwisance of ireland saw sir $gareth_of_orkney$ fare so he marvelled what he might be that one time seemed green and
another time at his again coming he seemed blue and thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his colour so that there might neither $king_arthur_s_court$ nor $black_knight$ have ready cognisance of him
then sir agwisance the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland encountered with sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and there sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him from his horse saddle and all
and then came $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ of scotland and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him down horse and man and in the same wise he served $king_arthur_s_court$ uriens of the #land# of gore
and then came in sir $king_bagdemagus$ and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him down horse and man to the earth and $king_bagdemagus$ son meliganus #brake# a spear upon sir $gareth_of_orkney$ mightily and knightly
and then sir galahault the noble prince cried on high $black_knight$ with the many colours well hast thou jousted now make thee ready that i may joust with thee
sir $gareth_of_orkney$ heard him and he gat a great spear and so they encountered together and there the prince #brake# his spear but sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him upon the left side of the #helm# that he reeled here and there and he had fallen down had not his men recovered him
so god me #help# said $king_arthur_s_court$ that same $black_knight$ with the many colours is a good $black_knight$ wherefore the $king_arthur_s_court$ called unto him sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and prayed him to encounter with that $black_knight$
sir said $launcelot_du_lake$ i may well find in my heart for to forbear him as at this time for he hath had travail enough this #day# and when a good $black_knight$ doth so well upon some #day# it is no good $black_knight$ part to let him of his worship and namely when he seeth a $black_knight$ hath done so great labour for peradventure said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ his quarrel is here this #day# and peradventure he is best beloved with this #lady# of all that be here
for i see well he paineth him and enforceth him to do great deeds and therefore said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ as for me this #day# he shall have the honour though it lay in my power to put him from it
i would not chapter xxix yet of the said #tournament# then when this was done there was drawing of swords and then there began a sore #tournament#
that was the red $black_knight$ of the red launds there was strong battle and betwixt sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and $bleoberis_de_ganis$ there was a strong battle and $sir_gawaine$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ met and there $sir_gawaine$ had the worse for he pulled $sir_gawaine$ from his horse and there he was long upon foot and defouled
then came in sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and he smote sir $turquine$ and he him and then came sir $king_carados$ his brother and both at once they assailed him and he as the most noblest $black_knight$ of the world worshipfully fought with them both that all men wondered of the noblesse of sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and there did sir $lamorak_de_galis$ marvellous deeds of #arm# and betwixt sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and sir $ironside$ and then came in sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and knew that it was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that fought with the two perilous #knight#
and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ came with his good horse and hurtled them in sunder and no #stroke# would he smite to sir $launcelot_du_lake$
that espied sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and deemed it should be the good $black_knight$ sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ rode here and there and smote on the right hand and on the left hand and all the folk might well espy where that he rode
and by #fortune# he met with his brother $sir_gawaine$ and there he put $sir_gawaine$ to the worse for he put off his #helm# and so he served five or six #knight# of the round table that all men said he put him in the most pain and best he did his devoir
for when sir $tristram_de_liones$ beheld him how he first jousted and after fought so well with a sword then he rode unto sir $ironside$ and to sir $persant$ of inde and asked them by their faith what manner a $black_knight$ is yonder $black_knight$ that seemeth in so many #diver# colours
truly meseemeth said $tristram_de_liones$ that he putteth himself in great pain for he never ceaseth wot #ye# not what he is said sir $ironside$
then shall #ye# know that this is he that loveth the #lady# of the castle and she him again and this is he that won me when i besieged the #lady# of this castle and this is he that won sir $persant$ of inde and his three brethren
he was called in the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $beaumains$ but his right name is sir $gareth_of_orkney$ brother to $sir_gawaine$
by my #head# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ he is a good $black_knight$ and a big man of #arm# and if he be young he shall prove a full noble $black_knight$
no said sir $tristram_de_liones$ what is his name said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and of what blood is he come he is but a child they all said and of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ he was made $black_knight$
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $ironside$ sir $persant$ and his brother rode together for to #help# sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and then there were given many strong #stroke#
therefore he is mickle the better said $tristram_de_liones$ and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ rode out on the one side to amend his #helm# and then said his dwarf
and so when he had drunk he gat on his #helm# and eagerly took his horse and rode into the field and left his ring with his dwarf and the dwarf was glad the ring was from him
take me your ring that #ye# lose it not while that #ye# drink for then he wist well he should be known
and then when sir $gareth_of_orkney$ was in the field all folks saw him well and plainly that he was in yellow colours and there he rased off #helm# and pulled down #knight# that $king_arthur_s_court$ had #marvel# what $black_knight$ he was for the $king_arthur_s_court$ saw by his hair that it was the same $black_knight$
chapter xxx how sir $gareth_of_orkney$ was espied by the heralds and how he escaped out of the field but before he was in so many colours and now he is but in one colour that is yellow
now go said $king_arthur_s_court$ unto #diver# heralds and ride about him and espy what manner $black_knight$ he is for i have spered of many #knight# this #day# that be upon his party and all say they know him not
and so an herald rode #nigh# $gareth_of_orkney$ as he could and there he saw written about his #helm# in gold this #helm# is sir $gareth_of_orkney$
then the herald cried as he were #wood# and many heralds with him this is sir $gareth_of_orkney$ in the yellow #arm# wherby all #king# and #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ beheld him and awaited and then they pressed all to behold him and ever the heralds cried this is sir $gareth_of_orkney$ $king_arthur_s_court$ lot son
and when sir $gareth_of_orkney$ espied that he was discovered then he doubled his #stroke# and smote down sir $sagramore$ and his brother $sir_gawaine$
o brother said $sir_gawaine$ i weened #ye# would not have stricken me so de worde $william_caxton$ that by
so when he heard him say so he thrang here and there and so with great pain he gat out of the press and there he met with his dwarf
o #boy# said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ thou hast beguiled me foul this #day# that thou kept my ring give it me anon again that i may hide my body withal and so he took it him
and then they all wist not where he was become and $sir_gawaine$ had in manner espied where sir $gareth_of_orkney$ rode and then he rode after with all his might
that espied sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and rode lightly into the forest that $sir_gawaine$ wist not where he was become and when sir $gareth_of_orkney$ wist that $sir_gawaine$ was passed he asked the dwarf of best counsel
sir said the dwarf meseemeth it were best now that #ye# are escaped from spying that #ye# send my $lady_dame_lionesse$ her ring
it is well advised said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ now have it here and bear it to her and say that i recommend me unto her good grace and say her i will come when i may and i pray her to be true and faithful to me as i will be to her
sir said the dwarf it shall be done as #ye# command and so he rode his #way# and did his errand unto the #lady#
then she said where is my $black_knight$ sir $gareth_of_orkney$ madam said the dwarf he bade me say that he would not be long from you
and so lightly the dwarf came again unto sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that would full fain have had a lodging for he had need to be reposed
and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ was not a little weary for of all that #day# he had but little #rest# neither his horse nor he
and then fell there a thunder and a rain as heaven and earth should go together so this sir $gareth_of_orkney$ rode so long in that forest until the night came
and ever it lightened and thundered as it had been #wood# at the last by #fortune# he came to a castle and there he heard the waits upon the walls
how sir $gareth_of_orkney$ came to a castle where he was well lodged and he jousted with a $black_knight$ and slew him
then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ rode unto the barbican of the castle and prayed the porter fair to let him into the castle
fair sir say not so for i am a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ and pray the lord or the #lady# of this castle to give me harbour for the love of $king_arthur_s_court$
then the porter went unto the duchess and told her how there was a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ would have harbour
let him in said the duchess for i will see that $black_knight$ and for $king_arthur_s_court$ sake he shall not be harbourless
chapter xxxi the porter answered ungoodly again and said thou gettest no lodging here then she yode up into a tower over the gate with great torchlight
when sir $gareth_of_orkney$ saw that torch light he cried on high whether thou be lord or #lady# #giant# or champion i take no #force# so that i may have harbour this night and if it so be that i must needs fight spare me not to morn when i have rested me for both i and mine horse be weary
sir $black_knight$ said the #lady# thou speakest knightly and boldly but #wit# thou well the lord of this castle loveth not $king_arthur_s_court$ nor #none# of his #court# for my lord hath ever been against him and therefore thou were better not to come within this castle for an thou come in this night thou must come in under such form that wheresomever thou meet my lord by stigh or by street thou must yield thee to him as #prisoner#
madam said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ what is your lord and what is his name sir my lord name is the duke de la rowse
well madam said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ i shall promise you in what place i meet your lord i shall yield me unto him and to his good grace
with that i understand he will do me no harm and if i understand that he will i will release myself an
#ye# say well said the duchess and then she let the drawbridge down and so he rode into the hall and there he alighted and his horse was led into a stable and in the hall he unarmed him and said madam i will not out of this hall this night and when it is daylight let see who will have ado with me he shall find me ready
i can with my spear and my sword then was he set unto supper and had many good dishes then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ list well to eat and knightly he ate his meat and eagerly
there was many a fair #lady# by him and some said they never saw a goodlier man nor so well of eating
then they made him passing good #cheer# and shortly when he had supped his #bed# was made there so he rested him all night
and on the morn he heard mass and #brake# his fast and took his leave at the duchess and at them all and thanked her goodly of her lodging and of his good #cheer# and then she asked him his name
madam he said truly my name is $gareth_of_orkney$ and some men call me $beaumains$ then knew she well it was the same $black_knight$ that fought for $lady_dame_lionesse$
so sir $gareth_of_orkney$ departed and rode up into a mountain and there met him a $black_knight$ his name was sir bendelaine and said to sir $gareth_of_orkney$
thou shalt not pass this #way# for either thou shalt joust with me or else be my #prisoner# then will i joust said sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and so they let their horses run and there sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him throughout the body and sir bendelaine rode forth to his castle there beside and there died
so sir $gareth_of_orkney$ would have rested him and he came riding to bendelaine castle then his #knight# and servants espied that it was he that had slain their lord
then they armed twenty good men and came out and assailed sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and so he had no spear but his sword and put his shield afore him and there they #brake# their spears upon him and they assailed him passingly sore
but ever sir $gareth_of_orkney$ defended him as a $black_knight$ chapter xxxii how sir $gareth_of_orkney$ fought with a $black_knight$ that held within his castle thirty #lady# and how he slew him
so when they saw that they might not overcome him they rode from him and took their counsel to slay his horse and so they came in upon sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and with spears they slew his horse and then they assailed him hard
but when he was on foot there was #none# that he fought but he gave him such a #buffet# that he did never recover
so he slew them by one and one till they were but four and there they fled and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ took a good horse that was one of theirs and rode his #way#
then he rode a great pace till that he came to a castle and there he heard much mourning of #lady# and gentlewomen
sir $black_knight$ said the #page# here be within this castle thirty #lady# and all they be widows for here is a $black_knight$ that waiteth daily upon this castle and his name is the brown $black_knight$ without pity and he is the periloust $black_knight$ that now liveth and therefore sir said the #page# i rede you flee
so there came by him a #page# what noise is this said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that i hear within this castle nay said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ i will not flee though thou be afeard of him
and then the #page# saw where came the brown $black_knight$ lo said the #page# yonder he cometh let me deal with him said sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and when either of other had a sight they let their horses run and the brown $black_knight$ #brake# his spear and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote him throughout the body that he overthrew him to the ground stark dead
so sir $gareth_of_orkney$ rode into the castle and prayed the #lady# that he might repose him alas said the #lady# #ye# may not be lodged here
make him good #cheer# said the #page# for this $black_knight$ hath slain your #enemy# then they all made him good #cheer# as lay in their power
and so on the morn he went to mass and there he saw the thirty #lady# kneel and lay grovelling upon #diver# #tomb# making great dole and #sorrow#
but #wit# #ye# well they made him good #cheer# for they might #none# otherwise do for they were but poor then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ wist well that in the #tomb# lay their lords
fair #lady# said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ #ye# must at the next feast of pentecost be at the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and say that i sir $gareth_of_orkney$ sent you thither
so he departed and by #fortune# he came to a mountain and there he found a goodly $black_knight$ that bade him abide sir $black_knight$ and joust with me
we shall do this said the #lady# what are #ye# said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ my name is said he the duke de la rowse
ah sir #ye# are the same $black_knight$ that i lodged once in your castle and there i made promise unto your #lady# that i should yield me unto you
ah said the duke art thou that proud $black_knight$ that profferest to fight with my #knight# therefore make thee ready for i will have ado with you
but the duke lightly avoided his horse and dressed his shield and drew his sword and bade sir $gareth_of_orkney$ alight and fight with him
so they let their horses run and there sir $gareth_of_orkney$ smote the duke down from his horse so he did alight and they did great battle together more than an hour and either #hurt# other full sore
at the last sir $gareth_of_orkney$ gat the duke to the earth and would have slain him and then he yield him to him
then must #ye# go said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ unto sir $king_arthur_s_court$ my lord at the next feast and say that i sir $gareth_of_orkney$ sent you unto him
it shall be done said the duke and i will do to you homage and fealty with an hundred #knight# with me and all the #day# of my life to do you service where #ye# will command me
chapter xxxiii how sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and $sir_gawaine$ fought each against other and how they knew each other by the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$
then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ took the duke shield and mounted upon horseback and so without biding they ran together as it had been the thunder
so the duke departed and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ stood there alone and there he saw an armed $black_knight$ coming toward him and there that $black_knight$ #hurt# sir $gareth_of_orkney$ under the side with his spear
and then they alighted and drew their swords and gave great #stroke# that the blood trailed to the ground and so they fought two hours
at the last there came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ that some men called the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $balin_le_savage$ and she came riding upon an ambling mule and there she cried all on high $sir_gawaine$ sir $sir_gawaine$ leave thy fighting with thy brother sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and when he heard her say so he threw away his shield and his sword and ran to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and took him in his #arm# and sithen kneeled down and asked him mercy
what are #ye# said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that right now were so strong and so mighty and now so suddenly yield you to me
o $gareth_of_orkney$ i am your brother $sir_gawaine$ that for your sake have had great #sorrow# and labour then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ unlaced his #helm# and kneeled down to him and asked him mercy
then they rose both and embraced either other in their #arm# and wept a great while or they might speak and either of them gave other the #prize# of the battle
and there were many kind words between them alas my fair brother said $sir_gawaine$ perdy i owe of right to worship you
an #ye# were not my brother for #ye# have worshipped $king_arthur_s_court$ and all his #court# for #ye# have sent him
more worshipful #knight# this twelvemonth than six the best of the round table have done except sir $launcelot_du_lake$ so de worde $william_caxton$ me
then came the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $balin_le_savage$ that was the #lady# $dame_linet$ that rode with sir $gareth_of_orkney$ so long and there she did staunch sir $gareth_of_orkney$ #wound# and $sir_gawaine$
meseemeth that it were well done that $king_arthur_s_court$ had witting of you both for your horses are so bruised that they may not bear
now fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said $sir_gawaine$ i pray you ride unto my lord mine uncle $king_arthur_s_court$ and tell him what adventure is to me betid here and i suppose he will not tarry long
now what will #ye# do said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $balin_le_savage$ then she took her mule and lightly she came to $king_arthur_s_court$ that was but two mile thence
and when he was upon his back he bade the lords and #lady# come after who that would and there was saddling and bridling of #queen# horses and princes horses and well was him that soonest might be ready
so when the $king_arthur_s_court$ came thereas they were he saw $sir_gawaine$ and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ sit upon a little hill side and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ avoided his horse
and when he came #nigh# sir $gareth_of_orkney$ he would have spoken but he might not and therewith he sank down in a swoon for gladness
and when she had told him tidings the $king_arthur_s_court$ bade get him a palfrey and so they stert unto their uncle and required him of his good grace to be of good comfort
#wit# #ye# well the $king_arthur_s_court$ made great joy and many a piteous #complaint# he made to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and ever he wept as he had been a child
with that came his #mother# the #queen# of $king_lot_of_orkney$ dame morgawse and when she saw sir $gareth_of_orkney$ readily in the visage she might not weep but suddenly fell down in a swoon and lay there a great while like as she had been dead
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded that all manner of #knight# that were under his obeissance should make their lodging right there for the love of his nephews
and so it was done and all manner of purveyance purveyed that there lacked nothing that might be gotten of tame nor wild for gold or silver
and then by the #mean# of the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $balin_le_savage$ $sir_gawaine$ and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ were healed of their #wound# and there they sojourned eight #day#
and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ recomforted his #mother# in such wise that she recovered and made good #cheer# then said $king_arthur_s_court$ unto the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $balin_le_savage$
i #marvel# that your sister $lady_dame_lionesse$ cometh not here to me and in especial that she cometh not to visit her $black_knight$ my nephew sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that hath had so much travail for her love
my lord said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ #ye# must of your good grace hold her excused for she knoweth not that my lord sir $gareth_of_orkney$ is here
go then for her said $king_arthur_s_court$ that we may be appointed what is best to be done according to the pleasure of my nephew
and as lightly as she might she made her ready and she came on the morn with her brother sir $gringamore$ and with her forty #knight#
and so when she was come she had all the #cheer# that might be done both of the $king_arthur_s_court$ and of many other #king# and #queen#
sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that shall be done and so she rode unto her sister chapter xxxiv how sir $gareth_of_orkney$ acknowledged that they loved each other to $king_arthur_s_court$ and of the appointment of their #wedding#
then when $sir_gawaine$ saw her there was many a goodly look and goodly words that all men of worship had joy to behold them
and among all these #lady# she was named the fairest and peerless then came $king_arthur_s_court$ and many other #king# and $dame_guenever$ and the #queen# of $king_lot_of_orkney$
and there the $king_arthur_s_court$ asked his nephew sir $gareth_of_orkney$ whether he would have that #lady# as #paramour# or to have her to his #wife#
my lord #wit# you well that i love her above all #lady# living now fair #lady# said $king_arthur_s_court$ what say #ye#
most noble $king_arthur_s_court$ said $lady_dame_lionesse$ #wit# you well that my lord sir $gareth_of_orkney$ is to me more liefer to have and wield as my husband than any $king_arthur_s_court$ or prince that is christened and
if i may not have him i promise you i will never have #none# for my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ said $lady_dame_lionesse$ #wit#
well he is my first love and he shall be the last and if #ye# will suffer him to have his will and free choice
#ye# i dare say he will have me that is truth said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ an i have not you and wield not you as my #wife# there shall never #lady# nor gentlewoman rejoice me
well i would not for the stint of my crown to be causer to withdraw your hearts and #wit# #ye# well
what nephew said the $king_arthur_s_court$ is the wind in that door for #wit# #ye# ye cannot love so well but i shall rather increase it than distress it
and also #ye# shall have my love and my lordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my power and in the same wise said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ #mother#
then there was made a provision for the #day# of marriage and by the $king_arthur_s_court$ advice it was provided that it should be at michaelmas following at kink kenadon by the seaside for there is a plentiful country
and then sir $gareth_of_orkney$ sent his summons to all these #knight# and #lady# that he had won in battle to #fore# that they should be at his #day# of marriage at kink kenadon by the sands
and then $lady_dame_lionesse$ and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_linet$ with sir $gringamore$ rode to their castle and a goodly and a rich ring she gave to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and he gave her another
and $king_arthur_s_court$ gave her a rich pair of beads of gold and so she departed and $king_arthur_s_court$ and his fellowship rode toward kink kenadon and sir $gareth_of_orkney$ brought his #lady# on the #way# and so came to the $king_arthur_s_court$ again and rode with him
the great #cheer# that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ made of sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and he of him for there was never no $black_knight$ that sir $gareth_of_orkney$ loved so well as he did sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and ever for the most part he would be in sir $launcelot_du_lake$ company for after sir $gareth_of_orkney$ had espied $sir_gawaine$ conditions he withdrew himself from his brother $sir_gawaine$ fellowship for he was vengeable and where he hated he would be avenged with murder and that hated sir $gareth_of_orkney$
and so it was cried in all the places through the realm lord so de worde $william_caxton$ bee
of the great royalty and what officers were made at the feast of the #wedding# and of the jousts at the feast
so it drew fast to michaelmas and thither came $lady_dame_lionesse$ the #lady# of the castle perilous and her sister $dame_linet$ with sir $gringamore$ her brother with them for he had the conduct of these #lady#
and upon michaelmas #day# the bishop of canterbury made the #wedding# betwixt sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and the $lady_dame_lionesse$ with great solemnity
and $king_arthur_s_court$ made $gaheris$ to wed the $damosel_of_the_lake$ $balin_le_savage$ that was $dame_linet$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ made sir agravaine to we
chapter xxxv and there they were lodged at the device of $king_arthur_s_court$ $lady_dame_lionesse$ niece a fair #lady# her name was dame laurel
and so when this solemnization was done then came in the green $black_knight$ sir pertolepe with thirty #knight# and there he did homage and fealty to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and these #knight# to hold of him for evermore
also sir pertolepe said i pray you that at this feast i may be your chamberlain with a good will said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ sith it liketh you to take so simple an office
then came in the red $black_knight$ with three score #knight# with him and did to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ homage and fealty and all those #knight# to hold of him for evermore
and then this sir perimones prayed sir $gareth_of_orkney$ to grant him to be his chief butler at that high feast i will well said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that #ye# have this office and it were better
then came in sir $persant$ of inde with an hundred #knight# with him and there he did homage and fealty and all his #knight# should do him service and hold their #land# of him for ever and there he prayed sir $gareth_of_orkney$ to make him his sewer chief at the feast
then came the duke de la rowse with an hundred #knight# with him and there he did homage and fealty to sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and so to hold their #land# of him for ever
i will well said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that #ye# have it and it were better and he required sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that he might serve him of the wine that #day# of that feast
then came in the red $black_knight$ of the red launds that was sir $ironside$ and he brought with him three hundred #knight# and there he did homage and fealty and all these #knight# to hold their #land# of him for ever
i will well said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and it were better and then he asked sir $gareth_of_orkney$ to be his carver i will well said sir $gareth_of_orkney$ an it please you
then came into the #court# thirty #lady# and all they seemed widows and those thirty #lady# brought with them many fair gentlewomen
and all they kneeled down at once unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and unto sir $gareth_of_orkney$ and there all those #lady# told the $king_arthur_s_court$ how sir $gareth_of_orkney$ delivered them from the dolorous tower and slew the brown $black_knight$ without pity and therefore we and our heirs for evermore will do homage unto sir $gareth_of_orkney$
so then the #king# and #queen# princes and earls barons and many bold #knight# went unto meat and well may #ye# #wit# there were all manner of meat plenteously all manner revels and games with all manner of minstrelsy that was used in those #day#
but the $king_arthur_s_court$ would not suffer sir $gareth_of_orkney$ to joust because of his new bride for as the french book saith that $lady_dame_lionesse$ desired of the $king_arthur_s_court$ that #none# that were wedded should joust at that feast
so the first #day# there jousted sir $lamorak_de_galis$ for he overthrew thirty #knight# and did passing marvellously deeds of #arm# and then $king_arthur_s_court$ made sir $persant$ and his two brethren #knight# of the round table to their lives end and gave them great #land#
also there was great jousts three #day# also the second #day# there jousted $tristram_de_liones$ best and he overthrew forty #knight# and did there marvellous deeds of #arm#
that was the red $black_knight$ of the red launds a $black_knight$ of the table round to his life end and gave him great #land#
the third #day# there jousted sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and he overthrew fifty #knight# and did many marvellous deeds of #arm# that all men wondered on him
and there $king_arthur_s_court$ made the duke de la rowse a $black_knight$ of the round table to his life end and gave him great #land# to spend
but when these jousts were done sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed suddenly and would not be known for the which $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the #court# were sore displeased
and there $king_arthur_s_court$ made $ironside$ and so they held the #court# forty #day# with great solemnity and this sir $gareth_of_orkney$ was a noble $black_knight$ and a well ruled and fair languaged
thus endeth this tale of sir $gareth_of_orkney$ that wedded $lady_dame_lionesse$ of the castle perilous and also sir $gaheris$ wedded her sister $dame_linet$ that was called the $damosel_of_the_lake$ sabage
and sir agrabaine wedded dame laurel a fair #lady# and great and mighty #land# with great riches gave with them $king_arthur_s_court$ that royally they might live till their lives end

here followeth the viii book viii chapter i how sir $tristram_de_liones$ was born and how his #mother# died at his #birth# wherefore she named him $tristram_de_liones$
it was a $king_arthur_s_court$ that hight $king_meliodas$ and he was lord and $king_arthur_s_court$ of the country of $tristram_de_liones$ and this $king_meliodas$ was a likely $black_knight$ as any was that time living
and by #fortune# he wedded $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ sister of cornwall and she was called elizabeth that was called both good and fair
and at that time $king_arthur_s_court$ reigned and he was whole $king_arthur_s_court$ of england wales and scotland and of many other realms howbeit there were many #king# that were lords of many countries but all they held their #land# of $king_arthur_s_court$ for in wales were two #king# and in the north were many #king# and in cornwall and in the west were two #king# also in ireland were two or three #king# and all were under the obeissance of $king_arthur_s_court$
so when this $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ had been with his #wife# within a while she waxed great with child and she was a full meek #lady# and well she loved her lord and
so was the $king_arthur_s_court$ of france and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of brittany and all the lordships unto rome he her again so there was great joy
then there was a #lady# in that country that had loved $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ long and by no #mean# she never could get his love therefore she let ordain upon a #day# as $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ rode a hunting for he was a great chaser and there by an enchantment she made him chase an hart by himself alone till that he came to an old castle and there anon he was taken #prisoner# by the #lady# that him loved
when elizabeth $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ #wife# missed her lord and she was #nigh# out of her #wit# and also as great with child as she was she took a gentlewoman with her and ran into the forest to seek her lord
betwixt them and when she was far in the forest she might no farther for she began to travail fast of her child
and she had many grimly throes her gentlewoman helped her all that she might and so by miracle of our #lady# of heaven
she was delivered with great pains but she had taken such cold for the default of #help# that deep draughts of death took her that needs
and when this #queen# elizabeth saw that there was #none# other bote then she made great dole and said unto her gentlewoman when #ye# see my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ recommend me unto him and tell him what pains i endure here for his love and how i must die here for his sake for default of good #help# and let him #wit# that i am full sorry to depart out of this world from him therefore pray him to be friend to my #soul#
she must die and depart out of this world there was #none# other bote now let me see my little child for whom i have had all this #sorrow#
ah my little son thou hast murdered thy #mother# and therefore i suppose thou that art a murderer so young thou art full likely to be a manly man in thine #age#
and because i shall die of the #birth# of thee i charge thee gentlewoman that thou pray my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ that when he is christened let call him $tristram_de_liones$ that is as much to say as a sorrowful #birth#
then the gentlewoman laid her under an umbre of a great tree and then she lapped the child as well as she might for cold
so there came the barons following after the #queen# and when they saw that she was dead and understood #none# other but the $king_arthur_s_court$ was destroyed then certain of them would have slain the child because they would have been lords of the country of $tristram_de_liones$
and when she saw him she said thus and therewith this #queen# gave up the ghost and died right printed by $william_caxton$ as part of chap
but then through the fair speech of the gentlewoman and by the #mean# that she made the most part of the barons would not assent thereto
ii chapter ii how the stepmother of sir $tristram_de_liones$ had ordained #poison# for to have poisoned sir $tristram_de_liones$ and then they let carry home the dead #queen# and much dole was made for her
then this meanwhile $merlin_gat_excalibur$ delivered $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ out of prison on the morn after his #queen# was dead and so when the $king_arthur_s_court$ was come home the most part of the barons made great joy
so then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let inter her richly and after he let christen his child as his #wife# had commanded afore her death
but the #sorrow# that the $king_arthur_s_court$ made for his #queen# that might no tongue tell and then he let call him $tristram_de_liones$ the sorrowful born child
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ endured seven years without a #wife# and all this time $tristram_de_liones$ was nourished well then it befell that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ wedded $king_arthur_s_court$ howell daughter of brittany and anon
she had children of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ then was she heavy and wroth that her children should not rejoice the country of $tristram_de_liones$ wherefore this #queen# ordained for to #poison# young $tristram_de_liones$
so she let #poison# be put in a piece of silver in the chamber whereas $tristram_de_liones$ and her children were together unto that intent that when $tristram_de_liones$ were thirsty he should drink that drink
and so it fell upon a #day# the #queen# son as he was in that chamber espied the piece with #poison# and he weened it had been good drink and because the child was thirsty he took the piece with #poison# and drank freely and therewithal suddenly the child brast and was dead
when the #queen# of $king_meliodas$ wist of the death of her son #wit# #ye# well that she was heavy but yet the $king_arthur_s_court$ understood nothing of her #treason#
and by #fortune# $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ her husband found the piece with wine where was the #poison# and he that was much thirsty took the piece for to drink thereout
and as he would have drunken thereof the #queen# espied him and then she ran unto him and pulled the piece from him suddenly
notwithstanding the #queen# would not leave this but eft she let ordain more #poison# and put it in a piece the $king_arthur_s_court$ marvelled why she did so and remembered him how her son was suddenly slain with #poison#
and then he took her by the hand and said thou false traitress thou shalt tell me what manner of drink this is or else i shall slay thee
and therewith he pulled out his sword and sware a great #oath# that he should slay her but if she told him truth
ah mercy my lord said she and i shall tell you all and then she told him why she would have slain $tristram_de_liones$ because her children should rejoice his #land#
and so she was condemned by the assent of the barons to be burnt and then was there made a great fire and right as she was at the fire to take her execution young $tristram_de_liones$ kneeled afore $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ and besought him to give him a boon
well said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ and therefore shall #ye# have the law i will well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ again then said young $tristram_de_liones$ give me the life of thy #queen# my stepmother
that is unrightfully asked said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ for thou ought of right to hate her for she would have slain thee with that #poison#
sir said $tristram_de_liones$ as for that i beseech you of your mercy that you will forgive it her and as for my part god forgive it her and i do and so much it liked your highness to grant me my boon for god love
an she might have had her will and for thy sake most is my #cause# that she should die i require you hold your promise
then said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i give her to you and go #ye# to the fire and take her and do with her what #ye# will
sithen it is so said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i will that #ye# have her life so sir $tristram_de_liones$ went to the fire and by the commandment of the $king_arthur_s_court$ delivered her from the death
but after that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ would never have ado with her as at #bed# and board but by the good #mean# of young $tristram_de_liones$ he made the $king_arthur_s_court$ and her accorded
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ was sent into france and had one to govern him named $gouvernail$ and how he learned to harp hawk and hunt
and then he let ordain a #gentleman# that was well learned and taught his name was $gouvernail$ and then he sent young $tristram_de_liones$ with $gouvernail$ into france to learn the language and nurture and deeds of #arm#
but then the $king_arthur_s_court$ would not suffer young $tristram_de_liones$ to abide no longer in his #court# chapter iii and there was $tristram_de_liones$ more than seven years
and then when he well could speak the language and had learned all that he might learn in that country then he came home to his father $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ again
and so $tristram_de_liones$ learned to be an harper passing all other that there was #none# such called in no country and so on harping and on instruments of music he applied him in his youth for to learn
and after as he grew in might and strength he laboured ever in hunting and in hawking so that never #gentleman# more that ever we heard read of
and as the book saith he began good measures of blowing of beasts of venery and beasts of chase and all manner of vermin and all these terms we have yet of hawking and hunting
wherefore as meseemeth all #gentleman# that bear old #arm# ought of right to honour sir $tristram_de_liones$ for the goodly terms that #gentleman# have and use and shall to the #day# of doom that thereby in a manner all men of worship may dissever a #gentleman# from a yeoman and from a yeoman a villain
and therefore the book of venery of hawking and hunting is called the book of sir $tristram_de_liones$ for he that gentle is will draw him unto gentle tatches and to follow the customs of noble #gentleman#
thus sir $tristram_de_liones$ endured in cornwall until he was big and strong of the #age# of eighteen years and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ had great joy of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and so had the #queen# his #wife#
for ever after in her life because sir $tristram_de_liones$ saved her from the fire she did never hate him more after but loved him ever after and gave $tristram_de_liones$ many great gifts for every estate loved him where that he went
chapter iv how sir $marhaus$ came out of ireland for to ask #truage# of cornwall or else he would fight therefore
then it befell that $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of ireland sent unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ of cornwall for his #truage# that cornwall had paid many winters
and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and his barons gave unto the #messenger# of ireland these words and #answer# that they would #none# pay and bade the #messenger# go unto his $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish and tell him we will pay him no #truage# but tell your lord an he will always have #truage# of us of cornwall bid him send a trusty $black_knight$ of his #land# that will fight for his right and we shall find another for to defend our right
and all that time $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ was behind of the #truage# for seven years with this #answer# the #messenger# departed into ireland
and then he called unto him sir $marhaus$ the good $black_knight$ that was nobly proved and a $black_knight$ of the table round
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish understood the #answer# of the #messenger# he was wonderly wroth and this $marhaus$ was brother unto the #queen# of ireland
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ said thus fair brother sir $marhaus$ i pray you go into cornwall for my sake and do battle for our #truage# that of right we ought to have and whatsomever #ye# spend #ye# shall have sufficiently more than #ye# shall need
sir said $marhaus$ #wit# #ye# well that i shall not be loath to do battle in the right of you and your #land# with the best $black_knight$ of the table round
for i know them for the most part what be their deeds and for to advance my deeds and to increase my worship i will right gladly go unto this journey for our right
so in all haste there was made purveyance for sir $marhaus$ and he had all #thing# that to him needed and so he departed out of ireland and arrived up in cornwall even fast by the castle of tintagil
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ understood that he was there arrived to fight for ireland then made $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ great #sorrow# when he understood that the good and noble $black_knight$ sir $marhaus$ was come
for they knew no $black_knight$ that durst have ado with him for at that time sir $marhaus$ was called one of the famousest and renowned #knight# of the world
and thus sir $marhaus$ abode in the sea and every #day# he sent unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ for to pay the #truage# that was behind of seven year other else to find a $black_knight$ to fight with him for the #truage#
then they of cornwall let make cries in every place that what $black_knight$ would fight for to save the #truage# of cornwall he should be rewarded so that he should fare the better term of his life
then some of the barons said to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and counselled him to send to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ for to seek sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that was that time named for the marvelloust $black_knight$ of all the world
then there were some other barons that counselled the $king_arthur_s_court$ not to do so and said that it was labour in vain because sir $marhaus$ was a $black_knight$ of the round table therefore any of them will be loath to have ado with other but if it were any $black_knight$ at his own request would fight disguised and unknown
so the $king_arthur_s_court$ and all his barons assented that it was no bote to seek any $black_knight$ of the round table
this #mean# while came the language and the noise unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ how that sir $marhaus$ abode battle fast by tintagil and how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ could find no manner $black_knight$ to fight for him
when young $tristram_de_liones$ heard of this he was wroth and sore ashamed that there durst no $black_knight$ in cornwall have ado with sir $marhaus$ of ireland
this manner of message sir $marhaus$ sent daily unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ chapter how $tristram_de_liones$ enterprized the battle to fight for the #truage# of cornwall and how he was made $black_knight$
therewithal $tristram_de_liones$ went unto his father $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ and asked him counsel what was best to do for to recover cornwall from #truage#
for as meseemeth said sir $tristram_de_liones$ it were shame that sir $marhaus$ the #queen# brother of ireland should go away unless that he were foughten withal
as for that said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ #wit# you well son $tristram_de_liones$ that sir $marhaus$ is called one of the best #knight# of the world and $black_knight$ of the table round and therefore i know no $black_knight$ in this country that is able to match with him
alas said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that i am not made $black_knight$ and if sir $marhaus$ should thus depart into ireland god let me never have worship an
and sir said $tristram_de_liones$ i pray you give me leave to ride to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and so #ye# be not displeased of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
i were made $black_knight$ i should match him will i be made $black_knight$ i will well said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ that #ye# be ruled as your courage will rule you
in the meanwhile there came a #messenger# with letters of love from $king_arthur_s_court$ faramon of france daughter unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that were full piteous letters and in them were written many #complaint# of love but sir $tristram_de_liones$ had no joy of her letters nor regard unto her
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ thanked his father much and then he made him ready to ride into cornwall also she sent him a little brachet that was passing fair
but when the $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter understood that sir $tristram_de_liones$ would not love her as the book saith she died for #sorrow#
and then the same squire that brought the letter and the brachet came again unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ as after #ye# shall hear in the tale
so this young sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode unto his eme $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ of cornwall and when he came there he heard say that there would no $black_knight$ fight with sir $marhaus$
then yede sir $tristram_de_liones$ unto his eme and said sir if #ye# will give me the order of knighthood i will do battle with sir $marhaus$
what are #ye# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and from whence be #ye# come sir said $tristram_de_liones$ i come from $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ that wedded your sister and a #gentleman# #wit#
$king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ beheld sir $tristram_de_liones$ and saw that he was but a young man of #age# but he was passingly well made and big
#ye# well i am fair sir said the $king_arthur_s_court$ what is your name and where were #ye# born sir said he again my name is $tristram_de_liones$ and in the country of $tristram_de_liones$ was i born
#ye# say well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and if #ye# will do this battle i shall make you $black_knight$ therefore i come to you said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and for #none# other #cause#
and therewithal anon as he had made him $black_knight$ he sent a #messenger# unto sir $marhaus$ with letters that said that he had found a young $black_knight$ ready for to take the battle to the uttermost
but then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ made him $black_knight$ it may well be said sir $marhaus$ but tell $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ i will not fight with no $black_knight$ but
he be of blood royal that is to say other $king_arthur_s_court$ son other #queen# son born of a prince or princess
when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ understood that he sent for sir $tristram_de_liones$ and told him what was the #answer# of sir $marhaus$
sithen that he saith so let him #wit# that i am come of father side and #mother# side of as noble blood as he is for sir now shall #ye# know that i am $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ son born of your own sister dame elizabeth that died in the forest in the #birth# of me
then in all the haste the $king_arthur_s_court$ let horse sir $tristram_de_liones$ and armed him in the best manner that might be had or gotten for gold or silver
and then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ sent unto sir $marhaus$ and did him to #wit# that a better born man than he was himself should fight with him and his name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ gotten of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ and born of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ sister
then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ $o_jesu$ said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ #ye# are welcome fair nephew to me then was sir $marhaus$ glad and blithe that he should fight with such a #gentleman#
and so by the assent of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and of sir $marhaus$ they let ordain that they should fight within an island #nigh# sir $marhaus$ ships and so was sir $tristram_de_liones$ put into a vessel both his horse and he and all that to him longed both for his body and for his horse
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and his barons of cornwall beheld how young sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed with such a carriage to fight for the right of cornwall there was neither man nor woman of worship
sir $tristram_de_liones$ lacked nothing but they wept to see and understand so young a $black_knight$ to jeopardy himself for their right
so to shorten this tale when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was arrived within the island he looked to the farther side and there he saw at an anchor six ships #nigh# to the #land# and under the shadow of the ships upon the #land# there hoved the noble $black_knight$ sir $marhaus$ of ireland
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ commanded his servant $gouvernail$ to bring his horse to the #land# and dress his harness at all manner of rights
and then when he had so done he mounted upon his horse and when he was in his saddle well apparelled and
chapter vi how sir $tristram_de_liones$ arrived into the island for to furnish the battle with sir $marhaus$ his shield dressed upon his shoulder $tristram_de_liones$ asked $gouvernail$ where is this $black_knight$ that i shall have ado withal
yonder he hoveth under the umbre of his ships on horseback with his spear in his hand and his shield upon his shoulder
sir said $gouvernail$ see #ye# him not i weened #ye# had seen him that is truth said the noble $black_knight$ sir $tristram_de_liones$ now i see him well enough
then he commanded his servant $gouvernail$ to go to his vessel again and commend me unto mine eme $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and pray him if that i be slain in this battle for to inter my body as him seemed best and as for me let him #wit# that i will never yield me for cowardice and if i be slain and flee not then they have lost no #truage# for me and if so be that i flee or yield me as recreant bid mine eme never bury me in christian burials
and upon thy life said sir $tristram_de_liones$ to $gouvernail$ come thou not #nigh# this island till that thou see me overcome or slain or else that i win yonder $black_knight$
so either departed from other sore weeping chapter vii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought against sir $marhaus$ and achieved his battle and how sir $marhaus$ fled to his ship
and then sir $marhaus$ avised sir $tristram_de_liones$ and said thus young $black_knight$ sir $tristram_de_liones$ what dost thou here me sore repenteth of thy courage for #wit#
well i have been assayed and the best #knight# of this #land# have been assayed of my hand and also i have matched with the best #knight# of the world and therefore by my counsel return again unto thy vessel
thou and fair $black_knight$ and well proved $black_knight$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ thou shalt well #wit# i may not forsake thee in this quarrel for i am for thy sake made $black_knight$
well #wit# that i am a $king_arthur_s_court$ son born and gotten upon a #queen# and such promise i have made at my uncle request and mine own seeking that i shall fight with thee unto the uttermost and deliver cornwall from the old #truage#
and also #wit# thou well sir $marhaus$ that this is the greatest #cause# that thou couragest me to have ado with thee for thou art called one of the most renowned #knight# of the world and because of that noise and fame that thou hast
for never yet was i proved with good $black_knight$ and sithen i took the order of knighthood this #day# i am well pleased that i may have ado with so good a $black_knight$ as thou art
and now #wit# thou well sir $marhaus$ that i cast me to get worship on thy body and if that i be not proved i trust to god that i shall be worshipfully proved upon thy body and to deliver the country of cornwall for ever from all manner of #truage# from ireland for ever
and thou shalt thou givest me courage to have ado with thee when sir $marhaus$ had heard him say what he would he said then thus again
fair $black_knight$ sithen it is so that thou castest to win worship of me i let thee #wit# worship may thou #none# lose by me if thou mayest stand me three #stroke#
for i let thee #wit# for my noble deeds proved and seen $king_arthur_s_court$ made me $black_knight$ of the table round
then they began to feutre their spears and they met so fiercely together that they smote either other down both horse and all
but sir $marhaus$ smote sir $tristram_de_liones$ a great #wound# in the side with his spear and then they avoided their horses and pulled out their swords and threw their shields afore them
and when they had stricken so together long then they left their #stroke# and foined at their breaths and visors and when they saw that that might not prevail them then they hurtled together like rams to bear either other down
thus they fought still more than half a #day# and either were wounded passing sore that the blood ran down freshly from them upon the ground
by then sir $tristram_de_liones$ waxed more fresher than sir $marhaus$ and better winded and bigger and with a mighty #stroke# he smote sir $marhaus$ upon the #helm# such a #buffet# that it went through his #helm# and through the coif of steel and through the brain pan and the sword stuck so fast in the #helm# and in his brain pan that sir $tristram_de_liones$ pulled thrice at his sword or ever he might pull it out from his #head# and there $marhaus$ fell down on his knees the edge of $tristram_de_liones$ sword left in his brain pan
and suddenly sir $marhaus$ rose grovelling and threw his sword and his shield from him and so ran to his ships and fled his #way# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ had ever his shield and his sword
and then they lashed together as men that were wild and courageous and when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw sir $marhaus$ withdraw him he said ah
thou dost thyself and thy kin great shame for i am but a young $black_knight$ or now i was never proved and rather than i should withdraw me from thee i had rather be hewn in an hundred pieces
sir $black_knight$ of the round table why withdrawest thou thee sir $marhaus$ answered no word but yede his #way# sore groaning
well sir $black_knight$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i promise thee thy sword and thy shield shall be mine and thy shield shall i wear in all places where i ride on mine adventures and in the sight of $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the round table
how sir $marhaus$ after that he was arrived in ireland died of the #stroke# that sir $tristram_de_liones$ had given him and how $tristram_de_liones$ was #hurt#
chapter viii anon sir $marhaus$ and his fellowship departed into ireland and as soon as he came to the $king_arthur_s_court$ his brother he let search his #wound#
and when his #head# was searched a piece of sir $tristram_de_liones$ sword was found therein and might never be had out of his #head# for no surgeons and so he died of sir $tristram_de_liones$ sword and that piece of the sword the #queen# his sister kept it for ever with her for she thought to be revenged an she might
now turn we again unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that was sore wounded and full sore bled that he might not within a little while
when he had taken cold unnethe stir him of his limbs and then he set him down softly upon a little hill and bled fast
and when he was come unto the #land# $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ took him in his #arm# and the $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ led sir $tristram_de_liones$ into the castle of tintagil
then anon came $gouvernail$ his man with his vessel and the $king_arthur_s_court$ and his barons came with procession against him and then was he searched in the best manner and laid in his #bed#
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ saw his #wound# he wept heartily and so did all his lords so god me #help# said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ i would not for all my #land# that my nephew died
so sir $tristram_de_liones$ lay there a month and more and ever he was like to die of that #stroke# that sir $marhaus$ smote him first with the spear
then was $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and all his barons passing heavy for they deemed #none# other but that sir $tristram_de_liones$ should not recover
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ let send after all manner of leeches and surgeons both unto men and women and there was #none# that would behote him the life
then came there a #lady# that was a right wise #lady# and she said plainly unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and to sir $tristram_de_liones$ and to all his barons that he should never be whole but if sir $tristram_de_liones$ went in the same country that the venom came from and in that country should he be holpen or else never
for as the french book saith the spear #head# was envenomed that sir $tristram_de_liones$ might not be whole thus said the #lady# unto the $king_arthur_s_court$
when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ understood that he let purvey for sir $tristram_de_liones$ a fair vessel well victualled and therein was put sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $gouvernail$ with him and sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his harp with him and so he was put into the sea to sail into ireland and so by good #fortune# he arrived up in ireland even fast by a castle where the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# was and at his arrival he sat and harped in his #bed# a merry lay
and when it was told the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# of such a $black_knight$ that was such an harper anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ sent for him and let search his #wound# and then asked him his name
then he answered i am of the country of $tristram_de_liones$ and my name is $tramtrist$ that thus was wounded in a battle as i fought for a #lady# right
so god me #help# said $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish #ye# shall have all the #help# in this #land# that #ye# may have here but i let you #wit# in cornwall
i had a great loss as ever had $king_arthur_s_court$ for there i lost the best $black_knight$ of the world his name was $marhaus$ a full noble $black_knight$ and $black_knight$ of the table round and there he told sir $tristram_de_liones$ wherefore sir $marhaus$ was slain
such one heard they never #none# in ireland before that time sir $tristram_de_liones$ made semblant as he had been sorry and better knew he how it was than the $king_arthur_s_court$
chapter ix how sir $tristram_de_liones$ was put to the keeping of $lady_la_beale_isoud$ first for to be healed of his #wound#
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ for great favour made $tramtrist$ to be put in his daughter ward and keeping because she was a noble surgeon
and when she had searched him she found in the bottom of his #wound# that therein was #poison# and so she healed him within a while and therefore $tramtrist$ cast great love to $lady_la_beale_isoud$ for she was at that time the fairest maid and #lady# of the world
and at that time sir $palamides_the_saracen$ was in that country and well cherished with the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen#
and every #day# sir $palamides_the_saracen$ drew unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and proffered her many gifts for he loved her passingly well
and there $tramtrist$ learned her to harp and she began to have a great fantasy unto him all that espied $tramtrist$ and full well knew he sir $palamides_the_saracen$ for a noble $black_knight$ and a mighty man
sir $tramtrist$ had great despite at sir $palamides_the_saracen$ for $lady_la_beale_isoud$ told $tramtrist$ that $palamides_the_saracen$ was in will to be christened for her sake
then it befell that $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish let cry a great jousts and a great #tournament# for a #lady# that was called the #lady# of the launds and she was #nigh# cousin unto the $king_arthur_s_court$
and #wit# you well thus was there great envy betwixt $tramtrist$ and sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and what man won her three #day# after he should wed her and have all her #land#
this cry was made in england wales scotland and also in france and in brittany it befell upon a #day# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ came unto sir $tramtrist$ and told him of this #tournament#
he answered and said fair #lady# i am but a feeble $black_knight$ and but late i had been dead had not your good ladyship been
now fair #lady# what would #ye# i should do in this matter well #ye# wot my #lady# that i may not joust
sir $palamides_the_saracen$ shall be there and to do what he may and therefore $tramtrist$ i pray you for to be there for else sir $palamides_the_saracen$ is like to win the degree
madam said $tramtrist$ as for that it may be so for he is a proved $black_knight$ and i am but a young $black_knight$ and late made and the first battle that i did it mishapped me to be sore wounded as #ye# see
but an i wist #ye# would be my better #lady# at that #tournament# i will be so that #ye# will keep my counsel and let no creature have knowledge that i shall joust but yourself and such as #ye# will to keep your counsel my poor person shall i jeopard there for your sake that peradventure sir $palamides_the_saracen$ shall know when that i come
thereto said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ do your best and as i can said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ i shall purvey horse and armour for you at my device
ah $tramtrist$ said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ why will #ye# not have ado at that #tournament# well i wot as #ye# will so be it said sir $tramtrist$ i will be at your commandment
so at the #day# of jousts there came sir $palamides_the_saracen$ with a black shield and he overthrew many #knight# that all the people had #marvel# of him
for he put to the worse $sir_gawaine$ $gaheris$ agravaine $king_bagdemagus$ $kay_the_seneschal$ dodinas le $balin_le_savage$ $sagramore$ le desirous gumret le petit and $griflet$ le fise de dieu
and then all manner of #knight# were adread of sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and many called him the $black_knight$ with the black shield
all these the first #day# sir $palamides_the_saracen$ struck down to the earth so that #day# sir $palamides_the_saracen$ had great worship then came $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish unto $tramtrist$ and asked him why he would not joust
sir he said i was but late #hurt# and as yet i dare not adventure me then came there the same squire that was sent from the $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter of france unto sir $tristram_de_liones$
and when he had espied sir $tristram_de_liones$ he fell flat to his feet all that espied $lady_la_beale_isoud$ what courtesy the squire made unto sir $tristram_de_liones$
and therewithal suddenly sir $tristram_de_liones$ ran unto his squire whose name was hebes le renoumes and prayed him heartily in no wise to tell his name
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ won the degree at a #tournament# in ireland and there made $palamides_the_saracen$ to bear no more harness in a year
sir said hebes i will not discover your name but if #ye# command me chapter then sir $tristram_de_liones$ asked him what he did in those countries
sir he said i came hither with $sir_gawaine$ for to be made $black_knight$ and if it please you of your hands that i may be made $black_knight$
then had $lady_la_beale_isoud$ great suspicion unto $tramtrist$ that he was some man of worship proved and therewith she comforted herself and cast more love unto him than she had done to #fore#
and so on the morn sir $palamides_the_saracen$ made him ready to come into the field as he did the first #day#
await upon me as to morn secretly and in the field i shall make you a $black_knight$ and there he smote down the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of scots
then had $lady_la_beale_isoud$ ordained and well arrayed sir $tristram_de_liones$ in white horse and harness and right so she let put him out at a privy postern
and so he came into the field as it had been a bright angel and anon sir $palamides_the_saracen$ espied him and therewith he feutred a spear unto sir $tramtrist$ and he again unto him
and then there was a great noise of people some said sir $palamides_the_saracen$ had a fall some said the $black_knight$ with the black shield had a fall
and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down sir $palamides_the_saracen$ unto the earth and #wit# you well $lady_la_beale_isoud$ was passing glad
and then $sir_gawaine$ and his fellows nine had #marvel# what $black_knight$ it might be that had smitten down sir $palamides_the_saracen$
then would there #none# joust with $tramtrist$ but all that there were forsook him most and least then sir $tristram_de_liones$ made hebes a $black_knight$ and caused him to put himself forth and did right well that #day#
and when sir $palamides_the_saracen$ had received this fall #wit# #ye# well that he was sore ashamed and as privily as he might he withdrew him out of the field
all that espied sir $tristram_de_liones$ and lightly he rode after sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and overtook him and bade him turn for better he would assay him or ever he departed
so after sir hebes held him with sir $tristram_de_liones$ then sir $palamides_the_saracen$ turned him and either lashed at other with their swords
but at the first #stroke# sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down $palamides_the_saracen$ and gave him such a #stroke# upon the #head# that he fell to the earth
so then $tristram_de_liones$ bade yield him and do his commandment or else he would slay him when sir $palamides_the_saracen$ beheld his #countenance# he dread his #buffet# so that he granted all his askings
first upon pain of your life that #ye# forsake my $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and in no manner wise that #ye# draw not to her
well said said sir $tristram_de_liones$ this shall be your charge also this twelvemonth and a #day# that #ye# bear #none# armour nor #none# harness of #war#
now promise me this or here shalt thou die alas said $palamides_the_saracen$ for ever am i ashamed then he sware as sir $tristram_de_liones$ had commanded him
and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ turned again to the castle where was $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and by the #way# he met with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that asked after sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that won the dolorous guard worshipfully and this $damosel_of_the_lake$ asked sir $tristram_de_liones$ what he was
for it was told her that it was he that smote down sir $palamides_the_saracen$ by whom the ten #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ were smitten down
then the $damosel_of_the_lake$ prayed sir $tristram_de_liones$ to tell her what he was and whether that he were sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for she deemed that there was no $black_knight$ in the world
then for despite and anger sir $palamides_the_saracen$ cut off his harness and threw them away might do such deeds of #arm#
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ #wit# #ye# well that i am not sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for i was never of such prowess but in god is all that he may make me as good a $black_knight$ as the good $black_knight$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$
now gentle $black_knight$ said she put up thy visor and when she beheld his visage she thought she saw never a better man visage nor a better faring $black_knight$
and then when the $damosel_of_the_lake$ knew certainly that he was not sir $launcelot_du_lake$ then she took her leave and departed from him
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode privily unto the postern where kept him $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and there she made him good #cheer# and thanked god of his good speed
so anon within a while the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# understood that it was $tramtrist$ that smote down sir $palamides_the_saracen$ then was he much made of more than he was before
how the #queen# espied that sir $tristram_de_liones$ had slain her brother sir $marhaus$ by his sword and in what jeopardy he was
but if it were $launcelot_du_lake$ chapter xi thus was sir $tramtrist$ long there well cherished with the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# and namely with $lady_la_beale_isoud$
and when he was in his bain the #queen# and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ her daughter roamed up and down in the chamber and therewhiles $gouvernail$ and hebes attended upon $tramtrist$ and the #queen# beheld his sword thereas it lay upon his #bed#
and then by unhap the #queen# drew out his sword and beheld it a long while and both they thought it a passing fair sword but within a foot and an half of the point there was a great piece thereof out broken of the edge
and when the #queen# espied that gap in the sword she remembered her of a piece of a sword that was found in the brain pan of sir $marhaus$ the good $black_knight$ that was her brother
alas then said she unto her daughter $lady_la_beale_isoud$ this is the same traitor $black_knight$ that slew my brother thine eme
so upon a #day# the #queen# and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ made a bain for sir $tramtrist$ when $lady_la_beale_isoud$ heard her say so she was passing sore abashed for passing
anon therewithal the #queen# went unto her own chamber and sought her coffer and there she took out the piece or the sword that was pulled out of sir $marhaus$ #head# after that he was dead
well she loved $tramtrist$ and full well she knew the cruelness of her #mother# the #queen# and then she ran with that piece of iron to the sword that lay upon the #bed#
and when she put that piece of steel and iron unto the sword it was as meet as it might be when it was new broken
and then the #queen# gripped that sword in her hand fiercely and with all her might she ran straight upon $tramtrist$ where he sat in his bain and there she had rived him through had not sir hebes gotten her in his #arm# and pulled the sword from her and else she had thrust him through
then when she was let of her evil will she ran to the $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish her husband and said on her knees
o my lord here have #ye# in your house that traitor $black_knight$ that slew my brother and your servant that noble $black_knight$ sir $marhaus$
who is that said $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish and where is he sir she said it is sir $tramtrist$ the same $black_knight$ that my daughter healed
alas said the $king_arthur_s_court$ therefore am i right heavy for he is a full noble $black_knight$ as ever i saw in field
but i charge you said the $king_arthur_s_court$ to the #queen# that #ye# have not ado with that $black_knight$ but let me deal with him
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ went into the chamber unto sir $tramtrist$ and then was he gone unto his chamber and the $king_arthur_s_court$ found him all ready armed to mount upon his horse
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ saw him all ready armed to go unto horseback the $king_arthur_s_court$ said nay $tramtrist$ it will not avail to compare thee against me but thus much i shall do for my worship and for thy love in so much as thou art within my #court#
it were no worship for me to slay thee therefore upon this condition i will give thee leave for to depart from this #court# in safety so thou wilt tell me who was thy father and what is thy name and if thou slew sir $marhaus$ my brother
chapter xii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed from the $king_arthur_s_court$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ out of ireland for to come into cornwall
sir said $tristram_de_liones$ now i shall tell you all the truth my father name is sir $king_meliodas$ $king_arthur_s_court$ of $tristram_de_liones$ and my #mother# hight elizabeth that was sister unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ of cornwall and my #mother# died of me in the forest and because thereof she commanded or she died that when i were christened they should christen me $tristram_de_liones$ and because i would not be known in this country
i turned my name and let me call $tramtrist$ and for the #truage# of cornwall i fought for my eme sake and for the right of cornwall that #ye# had posseded many years
and #wit# #ye# well said $tristram_de_liones$ unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ i did the battle for the love of mine uncle $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and for the love of the country of cornwall and for to increase mine honour for that same #day# that i fought with sir $marhaus$ i was made $black_knight$ and never or then did i battle with no $black_knight$ and from me he went alive and left his shield and his sword behind
so god me #help# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i may not say but #ye# did as a $black_knight$ should and it was your part to do for your quarrel and to increase your worship as a $black_knight$ should
howbeit i may not maintain you in this country with my worship unless that i should displease my barons and my #wife# and her kin
sir said $tristram_de_liones$ i thank you of your good lordship that i have had with you here and the great goodness my #lady# your daughter hath shewed me and
therefore said sir $tristram_de_liones$ it may so happen that #ye# shall win more by my life than by my death for in the parts of england
i may do you service at some season that #ye# shall be glad that ever #ye# shewed me your good lordship
with more i promise you as i am true $black_knight$ that in all places i shall be my #lady# your daughter servant and $black_knight$ in right and in wrong and i shall never fail her to do as much as a $black_knight$ may do
also i beseech your good grace that i may take my leave at my #lady# your daughter and at all the barons and #knight#
it may happen i will well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ then sir $tristram_de_liones$ went unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and took his leave of her
and then he told her all what he was and how he had changed his name because he would not be known and how a #lady# told him that he should never be whole till he came into this country where the #poison# was made wherethrough i was near my death had not your ladyship been
o gentle $black_knight$ said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ full woe am i of thy #departing# for i saw never man that i owed so good will to
madam said sir $tristram_de_liones$ #ye# shall understand that my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ gotten of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ and born of his #queen#
and therewithal she wept heartily and i promise you faithfully that i shall be all the #day# of my life your $black_knight$
but by your assent and to whom that #ye# will i shall be married to him will i have and he will have me if #ye# will consent
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ gave her a ring and she gave him another and therewith he departed from her leaving her making great dole and lamentation and he straight went unto the #court# among all the barons and there he took his leave at most and least
and openly he said among them all fair lords now it is so that i must depart if there be any man here that i have offended unto or that any man be with me
gramercy said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and i promise you there against that i shall not be married this seven years grieved let complain him here afore me or that ever i depart and i shall amend it unto my power
and if there be any that will proffer me wrong or say of me wrong or shame behind my back say it now or never and here is my body to make it good body against body
and all they stood still there was not one that would say one word yet were there some #knight# that were of the #queen# blood and of sir $marhaus$ blood but they would not meddle with him
so sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed and took the sea and with good wind he arrived up at tintagil in cornwall and when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ was whole in his prosperity there came tidings that sir $tristram_de_liones$ was arrived and whole of his #wound# thereof was $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ passing glad and so were all the barons and when he saw his time he rode unto his father $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ and there he had all the #cheer# that the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# could make him
chapter xiii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ hurted each other for the love of a $black_knight$ #wife# and then largely $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ and his #queen# departed of their #land# and goods to sir $tristram_de_liones$
then by the license of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ his father he returned again unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and there he lived in great joy long time until at the last there befell a jealousy and an unkindness betwixt $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ for they loved both one #lady#
and she was an earl #wife# that hight sir $segwarides$ and this #lady# loved sir $tristram_de_liones$ passingly well and he loved her again for she was a passing fair #lady# and that espied sir $tristram_de_liones$ well
so it fell upon a #day# this #lady# sent a dwarf unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ and bade him as he loved her that he would be with her the night next following
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ understood that and was jealous for $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ loved her passingly well also she charged you that #ye# come not to her
but if #ye# be well armed for her lover was called a good $black_knight$ sir $tristram_de_liones$ answered to the dwarf recommend me unto my #lady# and tell her i will not fail
and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ espied that the dwarf was with sir $tristram_de_liones$ upon message from $segwarides$ #wife# then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ sent for the dwarf and when he was come he made the dwarf by #force# to tell him all why and wherefore that he came on message from sir $tristram_de_liones$
now said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ go where thou wilt and upon pain of death that thou say no word that thou spakest with me so the dwarf departed from the $king_arthur_s_court$
and that same night that the steven was set betwixt $segwarides$ #wife# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ armed him and made him ready and took two #knight# of his counsel with him and so he rode afore for to abide by the #way# for to wait upon sir $tristram_de_liones$
and as sir $tristram_de_liones$ came riding upon his #way# with his spear in his hand $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ came hurtling upon him with his two #knight# suddenly
but i will be with her the term that she hath set me and with this #answer# the dwarf departed and all three smote him with their spears and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ #hurt# sir $tristram_de_liones$ on the breast right sore
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ feutred his spear and smote his uncle $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ so sore that he rashed him to the earth and bruised him that he lay still in a swoon and long it was or ever he might wield himself
and then he ran to the one $black_knight$ and eft to the other and smote them to the cold earth that they lay still
and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode forth sore wounded to the #lady# and found her abiding him at a postern chapter xiv
and there she welcomed him fair and either halsed other in #arm# and so she let put up his horse in the best wise and then she unarmed him
and so they supped lightly and went to #bed# with great joy and pleasaunce and so in his raging he took no keep of his green #wound# that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ had given him
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ lay with the #lady# and how her husband fought with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ be bled both the over sheet and the nether and pillows and #head# sheet
and within a while there came one afore that warned her that her lord was near hand within a bow draught so she made sir $tristram_de_liones$ to arise and so he armed him and took his horse and so departed
by then was come $segwarides$ her lord and when he found her #bed# troubled and broken and went near and beheld it by candle light then he saw that there had lain a wounded $black_knight$
ah false traitress then he said why hast thou betrayed me and therewithal he swang out a sword and said but if thou tell me who hath been here here thou shalt die
ah my lord mercy said the #lady# and held up her hands saying slay me not and i shall tell you all who hath been here
tell anon said $segwarides$ to me all the truth anon for dread she said here was sir $tristram_de_liones$ with me and by the #way# as he came to me
ward he was sore wounded ah false traitress said $segwarides$ where is he become sir she said he is armed and departed on horseback not yet hence half a mile
#ye# say well said $segwarides$ then he armed him lightly and gat his horse and rode after sir $tristram_de_liones$ that rode straightway unto tintagil
and within a while he overtook sir $tristram_de_liones$ and then he bade him turn false traitor $black_knight$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ anon turned him against him
and therewithal $segwarides$ smote sir $tristram_de_liones$ with a spear that it all to brast and then he swang out his sword and smote fast at sir $tristram_de_liones$
sir $black_knight$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i counsel you that #ye# smite no more howbeit for the wrongs that i have done you i will forbear you as long as i may
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ drew out his sword and hurtled his horse unto him fiercely and through the waist of the body he smote sir $segwarides$ that he fell to the earth in a swoon
nay said $segwarides$ that shall not be for either thou shalt die or i and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed and left him there
and so he rode unto tintagil and took his lodging secretly for he would not be known that he was #hurt#
also sir $segwarides$ men rode after their #master# whom they found lying in the field sore wounded and brought him home on his shield and there he lay long or that he were whole but at the last he recovered
also $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ would not be aknown of that sir $tristram_de_liones$ and he had met that night and as for sir $tristram_de_liones$ he knew not that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ had met with him
but as long as $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ lived he loved never sir $tristram_de_liones$ after that though there was fair speech love was there #none#
and thus it passed many weeks and #day# and all was forgiven and forgotten for sir $segwarides$ durst not have ado with sir $tristram_de_liones$ because of his noble prowess and also because he was nephew unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ therefore he let it overslip for he that hath a privy #hurt# is loath to have a shame outward
and so the $king_arthur_s_court$ askance came to sir $tristram_de_liones$ to comfort him as he lay sick in his #bed# chapter xv
how sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ demanded the fairest #lady# in $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ #court# whom he took away and how he was fought with
then it befell upon a #day# that the good $black_knight$ $bleoberis_de_ganis$ brother to $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and #nigh# cousin unto the good $black_knight$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ this $bleoberis_de_ganis$ came unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and there he asked of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ a boon to give him what gift that he would ask in his #court#
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ heard him ask so he marvelled of his asking but because he was a $black_knight$ of the round table and of a great renown $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ granted him his whole asking
then said sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ i will have the fairest #lady# in your #court# that me list to choose i may not say nay said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ now choose at your adventure
and so sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ did choose sir $segwarides$ #wife# and took her by the hand and so went his #way# with her and so he took his horse and gart
when sir $segwarides$ heard tell that his #lady# was gone with a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# then he armed him and rode after that $black_knight$ for to rescue his #lady#
set her behind his squire and rode upon his #way# so when $bleoberis_de_ganis$ was gone with this #lady# $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and all the #court# was wroth that she was away
then were there certain #lady# that knew that there were great love between sir $tristram_de_liones$ and her and also that #lady# loved sir $tristram_de_liones$ above all other #knight#
then there was one #lady# that rebuked sir $tristram_de_liones$ in the horriblest wise and called him coward $black_knight$ that he would for shame of his knighthood
see a #lady# so shamefully be taken away from his uncle #court# but she meant that either of them had loved other with entire heart
but sir $tristram_de_liones$ answered her thus fair #lady# it is not my part to have ado in such matters while her lord and husband is present here and if it had been that her lord had not been here in this #court# then for the worship of this #court# peradventure i would have been her champion and if so be sir $segwarides$ speed
then within a while came one of sir $segwarides$ squires and told in the #court# that sir $segwarides$ was beaten sore and wounded to the point of death as he would have rescued his #lady# sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ overthrew him and sore hath wounded him
not well it may happen that i will speak with that good $black_knight$ or ever he pass from this country then was $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ heavy thereof and all the #court#
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard of this he was ashamed and sore grieved and then was he soon armed and on horseback and $gouvernail$ his servant bare his shield and spear
and so as sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode fast he met with sir $andred$ his cousin that by the commandment of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ was sent to bring forth an ever it lay in his power two #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# that rode by the country to seek their adventures
so god me #help# said sir $andred$ there was never worse with me for here by the commandment of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
i was sent to fetch two #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and that one beat me and wounded me and set nought by my message
fair cousin said sir $tristram_de_liones$ ride on your #way# and if i may meet them it may happen i shall revenge you
so sir $andred$ rode into cornwall and sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode after the two #knight# the which one hight $sagramore$ le desirous and the other hight dodinas le $balin_le_savage$
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw sir $andred$ he asked him what tidings chapter xvi how sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought with two #knight# of the round table
sir said $gouvernail$ unto his #master# sir i would counsel you not to have ado with them for they be two proved #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
then within a while sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw them afore him two likely #knight# as for that said sir $tristram_de_liones$ have #ye# no doubt
but i will have ado with them to increase my worship for it is many #day# sithen i did any deeds of #arm#
and therewithal anon sir $tristram_de_liones$ asked them from whence they came and whither they would and what they did in those marches
sir $sagramore$ looked upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ and had scorn of his words and asked him again fair $black_knight$ be #ye# a $black_knight$ of cornwall
for it is seldom seen said sir $sagramore$ that #ye# cornish #knight# be valiant men of #arm# for within these two hours there met us one of your cornish #knight# and great words he spake and anon with little
do as #ye# list said $gouvernail$ whereby ask #ye# it said sir $tristram_de_liones$ might he was laid to the earth and as i trow said sir $sagramore$ #ye# shall have the same handsel that he had
fair lords said sir $tristram_de_liones$ it may so happen that i may better withstand than he did and whether #ye# will or nill i will have ado with you because he was my cousin that #ye# beat
and therefore here do your best and #wit# #ye# well but if #ye# quit you the better here upon this ground one $black_knight$ of cornwall shall beat you both
when sir dodinas le $balin_le_savage$ heard him say so he gat a spear in his hand and said sir $black_knight$ keep well thyself
and sir dodinas spear brast in sunder but sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote him with a more might that he smote him clean over the horse croup that #nigh# he had broken his #neck#
and then they departed and came together as it had been thunder when sir $sagramore$ saw his fellow have such a fall he marvelled what $black_knight$ he might be
and he dressed his spear with all his might and sir $tristram_de_liones$ against him and they came together as the thunder and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote sir $sagramore$ a strong #buffet# that he bare his horse and him to the earth and in the falling he #brake# his thigh
when this was done sir $tristram_de_liones$ asked them fair #knight# will #ye# any more be there no bigger #knight# in the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$
it is to you shame to say of us #knight# of cornwall dishonour for it may happen a cornish $black_knight$ may match you
that is truth said sir $sagramore$ that have we well proved but i require thee said sir $sagramore$ tell us your right name by the faith and troth that #ye# owe to the high order of knighthood
#ye# charge me with a great #thing# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sithen #ye# list to #wit# it #ye# shall know and understand that my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ son and nephew unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
then were they two #knight# fain that they had met with $tristram_de_liones$ and so they prayed him to abide in their fellowship
nay said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for i must have ado with one of your fellows his name is sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$
god speed you well said sir $sagramore$ and dodinas sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed and rode onward on his #way# and then was
he #ware# before him in a #valley# where rode sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ with sir $segwarides$ #lady# that rode behind his squire upon a palfrey
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought with sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ for a #lady# and how the #lady# was put to choice to whom she would go
chapter #xvii# then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode more than a pace until that he had overtaken him then spake sir $tristram_de_liones$ abide he said $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# bring again that #lady# or deliver her to me
i will do neither said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ for i dread no cornish $black_knight$ so sore that me list to deliver her why said sir $tristram_de_liones$ may not a cornish $black_knight$ do as well as another $black_knight$
this same #day# two #knight# of your #court# within this three mile met with me and or ever we departed they found a cornish $black_knight$ good enough for them both
they told me said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that the one of them hight sir $sagramore$ le desirous and the other hight dodinas le $balin_le_savage$
so god me #help# they were two good #knight# and men of great worship and if #ye# have beat them both #ye# must needs be a good $black_knight$ but if it so be #ye# have beat them both yet shall #ye# not fear me but #ye# shall beat me or ever #ye# have this #lady#
what were their names said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ ah said sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ have #ye# met with them then defend you said sir $tristram_de_liones$
then they avoided their horses and lashed together eagerly with swords and mightily now tracing and traversing on the right hand and on the left hand more than two hours
so they departed and came together like thunder and either bare other down horse and all to the earth and sometime they rushed together with such a might that they lay both grovelling on the ground
then sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ stert aback and said thus now gentle good $black_knight$ a while hold your hands and let us speak together
say what #ye# will said $tristram_de_liones$ and i will #answer# you sir said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ i would #wit# of whence #ye# be and of whom #ye# be come and what is your name
well i am $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_meliodas$ son and my #mother# is $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ sister and my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ is mine uncle
truly said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ i am right glad of you for #ye# are he that slew $marhaus$ the $black_knight$ hand for hand in an island for the #truage# of cornwall also #ye# overcame sir $palamides_the_saracen$ the good $black_knight$ at a #tournament# in an island where #ye# beat $sir_gawaine$ and his nine fellows
so god me #help# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i fear not to tell you my name #wit# #ye# so god me #help# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ #wit# #ye# well that i am the same $black_knight$
well that my name is sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and my brother hight sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ that is called a good $black_knight$ and we be sister children unto my lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that we call one of the best #knight# of the world
that is truth said sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ is called peerless of courtesy and of knighthood and for his sake said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will not with my good will fight no more with you for the great love i have to sir $launcelot_du_lake$
in good faith said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ as for me i will be loath to fight with you but sithen #ye# follow me here to have this #lady# i shall proffer you kindness courtesy and gentleness right here upon this ground
now i have told you my name tell me yours with good will #wit# #ye# this #lady# shall be betwixt us both and to whom that she will go let him have her in #peace#
i will well said $tristram_de_liones$ for as i deem she will leave you and come to me #ye# shall prove it anon said $bleoberis_de_ganis$
chapter xviii how the #lady# forsook sir $tristram_de_liones$ and abode with sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and how she desired to go to her husband
#wit# #ye# well sir $tristram_de_liones$ that but late thou wast the man in the world that i most loved and trusted and i weened thou hadst loved me again above all #lady# but when thou sawest this $black_knight$ lead me away thou madest no #cheer# to rescue me but suffered my lord $segwarides$ ride after me but until that time i weened thou haddest loved me and therefore now i will leave thee and never love thee more
so when she was set betwixt them both she said these words unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ and therewithal she went unto sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw her do so he was wonderly wroth with that #lady# and ashamed to come to the #court#
sir $tristram_de_liones$ said sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ #ye# are in the default for i hear by this #lady# words she before this #day# trusted you above all earthly #knight#
and as she saith #ye# have deceived her therefore #wit# #ye# well there may no man hold that will away and rather than #ye# should be heartily displeased with me
i would #ye# had her an she would abide with you nay said the #lady# so god me #help# i will never go with him for he that i loved most
and therefore sir $tristram_de_liones$ she said ride as thou came for though thou haddest overcome this $black_knight$ as #ye# was likely with thee
and i shall pray this $black_knight$ so fair of his knighthood that or ever he pass this country that he will lead me to the abbey where my lord sir $segwarides$ lieth
so god me #help# said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ i let you #wit# good $black_knight$ sir $tristram_de_liones$ because $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ gave me the choice of a gift in this #court# and so this #lady# liked me best notwithstanding she is wedded and hath a lord and i have fulfilled my #quest# she shall be sent unto her husband again and in especial most for your sake sir $tristram_de_liones$ and if she would go with you i would #ye# had her
i weened he had loved me never would i have gone i thank you said sir $tristram_de_liones$ but for her love i shall beware what manner
i should have been the first that should have followed you but sithen that #ye# have refused me as i am true
a #lady# i shall love or trust for had her lord sir $segwarides$ been away from the #court# $black_knight$ i shall
her know passingly well that i shall love or trust and so they took their leave one from the other and departed
and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode unto tintagil and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ rode unto the abbey where sir $segwarides$ lay sore wounded and there he delivered his #lady# and departed as a noble $black_knight$ and when sir $segwarides$ saw his #lady# he was greatly comforted and then she told him that sir $tristram_de_liones$ had done great battle with sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and caused him to bring her again
these words pleased sir $segwarides$ right well that sir $tristram_de_liones$ would do so much and so that #lady# told all the battle unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ betwixt sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$
chapter xix how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ sent sir $tristram_de_liones$ for $lady_la_beale_isoud$ toward ireland and how by #fortune# he arrived into england
then when this was done $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ cast always in his heart how he might destroy sir $tristram_de_liones$ and then he imagined in himself to send sir $tristram_de_liones$ into ireland for $lady_la_beale_isoud$
for sir $tristram_de_liones$ had so praised her beauty and her goodness that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ said that he would wed her whereupon he prayed sir $tristram_de_liones$ to take his #way# into ireland for him on message
notwithstanding sir $tristram_de_liones$ would not refuse the message for no danger nor peril that might fall for the pleasure of his uncle but to go he made him ready in the most goodliest wise that might be devised
for sir $tristram_de_liones$ took with him the most goodliest #knight# that he might find in the #court# and they were arrayed after the guise that was then used in the goodliest manner
and all this was done to the intent to slay sir $tristram_de_liones$ so sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed and took the sea with all his fellowship
a tempest took him and his fellowship and drove them back into the coast of england and there they arrived fast by camelot and full fain they were to take the #land#
and when they were landed sir $tristram_de_liones$ set up his #pavilion# upon the #land# of camelot and there he let hang his shield upon the #pavilion#
and anon as he was in the broad sea and that same #day# came two #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ that one was sir $ector_de_maris$ and sir morganor
and they touched the shield and bade him come out of the #pavilion# for to joust an he would joust #ye# shall be answered said sir $tristram_de_liones$ an #ye# will tarry a little while
so he made him ready and first he smote down sir $ector_de_maris$ and after he smote down sir morganor all with one spear and sore bruised them
and when they lay upon the earth they asked sir $tristram_de_liones$ what he was and of what country he was $black_knight$
fair lords said sir $tristram_de_liones$ #wit# #ye# well that i am of cornwall alas said sir $ector_de_maris$ now am i ashamed that ever any cornish $black_knight$ should overcome me
and then for despite sir $ector_de_maris$ put off his armour from him and went on foot and would not ride chapter #xx#
then it fell that sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ that were brethren they had summoned the $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of ireland for to come to $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# upon pain of forfeiture of $king_arthur_s_court$ good grace
and if the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland came not in at the #day# assigned and set the $king_arthur_s_court$ should lose his #land#
so it happened that at the #day# assigned $king_arthur_s_court$ neither sir $launcelot_du_lake$ might not be there for to give the judgment for $king_arthur_s_court$ was with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ at the castle joyous garde
how $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of ireland was summoned to come to $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# for #treason# and so $king_arthur_s_court$ assigned $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of scots to be there that #day# as judges
then was there sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and appealed the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland of #treason# that he had slain a cousin of his in his #court# in ireland by #treason#
the $king_arthur_s_court$ was sore abashed of his accusation for why he was come at the summons of $king_arthur_s_court$ and or he came at camelot
so when the #king# were at camelot $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of ireland was come to know his accusers he wist not wherefore he was sent after
and when the $king_arthur_s_court$ heard sir $blamore_de_ganis$ say his will he understood well there was #none# other remedy but for to #answer# him knightly for the custom was such in those #day# that an any man were appealed of any #treason# or murder he should fight body for body or else to find another $black_knight$ for him
so when $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish understood his accusing he was passing heavy for he knew sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ that he was a noble $black_knight$ and of noble #knight# come
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland was simply purveyed of his #answer# therefore the judges gave him respite by the third #day# to give his #answer#
and all manner of murders in those #day# were called #treason# so the $king_arthur_s_court$ departed unto his lodging the meanwhile there came a #lady# by sir $tristram_de_liones$ #pavilion# making great dole
said the #lady# i am ashamed unless that some good $black_knight$ #help# me for a great #lady# of worship sent by me a fair child and a rich unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and hereby there met with me a $black_knight$ and threw me down from my palfrey and took away the child from me
well my #lady# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and for my lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sake i shall get you that child again or else i shall be beaten for it
and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his horse and asked the #lady# which #way# the $black_knight$ rode and then she told him
what aileth you said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that #ye# make such dole ah fair $black_knight$ and he rode after him and within a while he overtook that $black_knight$
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ bade him turn and give again the child chapter xxi how sir $tristram_de_liones$ rescued a child from a $black_knight$ and how $gouvernail$ told him of $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish
the $black_knight$ turned his horse and made him ready to fight and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote him with a sword such a #buffet# that he tumbled to the earth
and then he yielded him unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ then come thy #way# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and bring the child to the #lady# again
so he took his horse meekly and rode with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and then by the #way# sir $tristram_de_liones$ asked him his name
then he said my name is $breuse_saunce_pite$ so when he had delivered that child to the #lady# he said
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ let him go again that sore repented him after for he was a great foe unto many good #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
then when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was in his #pavilion# $gouvernail$ his man came and told him how that $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of ireland was come thither and he was put in great distress and there $gouvernail$ told sir $tristram_de_liones$ how $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish was summoned and appealed of murder
so god me #help# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ these be the best tidings that ever came to me this seven years for now shall the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland have need of my #help# for i daresay there is no $black_knight$ in this country that is not of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# dare do battle with sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and for to win the love of the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland i will take the battle upon me and therefore $gouvernail$ bring me i charge thee to the $king_arthur_s_court$
sir as in this the child is well remedied then $gouvernail$ went unto $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of ireland and saluted him fair
the $king_arthur_s_court$ welcomed him and asked him what he would sir said $gouvernail$ here is a $black_knight$ near hand that desireth to speak with you
sir said he it is sir $tristram_de_liones$ that for your good grace that #ye# showed him in your #land# will reward you in this country
he bade me say he would do you service what $black_knight$ is he said the $king_arthur_s_court$ come on fellow said the $king_arthur_s_court$ with me anon and show me unto sir $tristram_de_liones$
so the $king_arthur_s_court$ took a little hackney and but few fellowship with him until he came unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ #pavilion# and when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw the $king_arthur_s_court$ he ran unto him and would have holden his stirrup
my gracious lord said sir $tristram_de_liones$ gramercy of your great goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and #land# and at that time i promised you to do you service
but the $king_arthur_s_court$ leapt from his horse lightly and either halsed other in their #arm# an ever it lay in my power
and gentle $black_knight$ said the $king_arthur_s_court$ unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ now have i great need of you never had i so great need of no $black_knight$ #help#
i shall tell you said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i am summoned and appealed from my country for the death of a $black_knight$ that was kin unto the good $black_knight$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ wherefore
sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ brother to sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ hath appealed me to fight with him outher to find a $black_knight$ in my stead
and well i wot said the $king_arthur_s_court$ these that are come of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ blood as sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and these other are passing good #knight# and hard men for to win in battle as any that i know now living
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for the good lordship #ye# showed me in ireland and for my #lady# your daughter sake $lady_la_beale_isoud$ i will take the battle for you upon this condition that #ye# shall grant me two #thing# that one is that #ye# shall swear to me that #ye# are in the right that #ye# were never consenting to the $black_knight$ death sir then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ when that i have done this battle if god give me grace that i speed that #ye# shall give me a reward what #thing# reasonable that i will ask of you
how so my good lord said sir $tristram_de_liones$ so god me #help# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# shall have whatsomever #ye# will ask
it is well said said sir $tristram_de_liones$ chapter xxii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought for sir anguish and overcame his adversary and how his adversary would never yield him
now make your #answer# that your champion is ready for i shall die in your quarrel rather than to be recreant
i have no doubt of you said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that an #ye# should have ado with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ as for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ he is called the noblest $black_knight$ of the world and #wit# #ye# well that the #knight# of his blood are noble men and dread shame and as for $bleoberis_de_ganis$ brother unto sir $blamore_de_ganis$ i have done battle with him therefore upon my #head# it is no shame to call him a good $black_knight$
sir as for that let him be he shall never be refused an as he were the best $black_knight$ that now beareth shield or spear
so $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish departed unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and the #king# that were that time as judges and told them that he had found his champion ready
then by the commandment of the #king# sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ were sent for to hear the charge
and when they were come before the judges there were many #king# and #knight# beheld sir $tristram_de_liones$ and much speech they had of him because that he slew sir $marhaus$ the good $black_knight$ and because he for jousted sir $palamides_the_saracen$ the good $black_knight$
it is noised said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that $blamore_de_ganis$ is the hardier $black_knight$ so when they had taken their charge they withdrew them to make them ready to do battle
fair dear brother remember of what kin we be come of and what a man is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ neither farther nor nearer but brother children and there was never #none# of our kin that ever was shamed in battle and rather suffer death brother than to be shamed
brother said $blamore_de_ganis$ have #ye# no doubt of me for i shall never shame #none# of my blood howbeit i am sure that yonder $black_knight$ is called a passing good $black_knight$ as of his time one of the world yet shall i never yield me nor say the loath word well may he happen to smite me down with his great might of chivalry but rather shall he slay me than i shall yield me as recreant
god speed you well said sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ for #ye# shall find him the mightiest $black_knight$ that ever #ye# had ado withal for i know him for i have had ado with him
god me speed said sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and therewith he took his horse at the one end of the lists and sir $tristram_de_liones$ at the other end of the lists and
so they feutred their spears and came together as it had been thunder and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ through great might smote down sir $blamore_de_ganis$ and his horse to the earth
then anon sir $blamore_de_ganis$ avoided his horse and pulled out his sword and threw his shield afore him and bade sir $tristram_de_liones$ alight
then said sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ unto his brother sir $blamore_de_ganis$ for though an horse hath failed me i trust to god the earth will not fail me
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ alighted and dressed him unto battle and there they lashed together strongly as racing and tracing foining and dashing many sad #stroke# that the #king# and #knight# had great #wonder# that they might stand for ever they fought like #wood# men so that there was never #knight# seen fight more fiercely than they did for sir $blamore_de_ganis$ was so hasty that he would have no #rest# that all men wondered that they had breath to stand on their feet and all the place was bloody that they fought in
and at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote sir $blamore_de_ganis$ such a #buffet# upon the #helm# that he there fell down upon his side and sir $tristram_de_liones$ stood and beheld him
chapter xxiii how sir $blamore_de_ganis$ desired $tristram_de_liones$ to slay him and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ spared him and how they took appointment
then when sir $blamore_de_ganis$ might speak he said thus sir $tristram_de_liones$ i require thee as thou art a noble $black_knight$ and the best $black_knight$ that ever i found that thou wilt slay me out for i would not live to be made lord of all the earth for i have liefer die with worship than live with shame and needs sir $tristram_de_liones$ thou must slay me or else thou shalt never win the field for i will never say the loath word
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard him say so knightly he wist not what to do with him he remembering him of both parties of what blood he was come and for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sake he would be loath to slay him and in the other party in no wise he might not choose but that he must make him to say the loath word or else to slay him
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ stert aback and went to the #king# that were judges and there he kneeled down to #fore# them and besought them for their worships and for $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sake that they would take this matter in their hands
for my fair lords said sir $tristram_de_liones$ it were shame and pity that this noble $black_knight$ that yonder lieth should be slain for #ye# hear well shamed will he not be
and therefore if thou dare slay me slay me i require thee and i pray to god that he never be slain nor shamed for me
and as for the $king_arthur_s_court$ for whom i fight for i shall require him as i am his true champion and true $black_knight$ in this field that he will have mercy upon this good $black_knight$
so god me #help# said $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish i will for your sake sir $tristram_de_liones$ be ruled as #ye# will have me for i know you for my true $black_knight$ and therefore i will heartily pray the #king# that be here as judges to take it in their hands
my lords said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ though my brother be beaten and hath the worse through might of #arm# i dare say though sir $tristram_de_liones$ hath beaten his body he hath not beaten his heart and i thank god he is not shamed this #day# and rather than he should be shamed
and the #king# that were judges called sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ to them and asked him his advice i require you said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ let sir $tristram_de_liones$ slay him out
it shall not be so said the #king# for his part adversary both the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the champion have pity of sir $blamore_de_ganis$ knighthood
my lords said $bleoberis_de_ganis$ i will right well as #ye# will then the #king# called the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland and found him goodly and treatable
and then by all their advices sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ took up sir $blamore_de_ganis$ and the two brethren were accorded with $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish and kissed and made friends for ever
and then sir $blamore_de_ganis$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ kissed together and there they made their #oath# that they would never #none# of them two brethren fight with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ made the same #oath#
and for that gentle battle all the blood of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ loved sir $tristram_de_liones$ for ever then $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish and sir $tristram_de_liones$ took their leave and sailed into ireland with great noblesse and joy
so when they were in ireland the $king_arthur_s_court$ let make it known throughout all the #land# how and in what manner sir $tristram_de_liones$ had done for him
but the joy that $lady_la_beale_isoud$ made of sir $tristram_de_liones$ there might no tongue tell for of all men earthly she loved him most
then the #queen# and all that there were made the most of him that they might chapter xxiv how sir $tristram_de_liones$ demanded $lady_la_beale_isoud$ for $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ drank the love drink
then upon a #day# $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish asked sir $tristram_de_liones$ why he asked not his boon for whatsomever he had promised him he should have it without fail
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ now is it time this is all that i will desire that #ye# will give me $lady_la_beale_isoud$ your daughter not for myself but for mine uncle $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ that shall have her to #wife# for so have i promised him
alas said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i had liefer than all the #land# that i have #ye# would wed her yourself sir an
therefore said sir i $tristram_de_liones$ i pray you hold your promise that #ye# promised me for this is my desire that #ye# will give me $lady_la_beale_isoud$ to go with me into cornwall for to be wedded to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ mine uncle
i did then i were shamed for ever in this world and false of my promise as for that said $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish #ye# shall have her with you to do with her what it please you
yourself that is me liefest and if #ye# will give her unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ your uncle that is in your choice
so to make short conclusion $lady_la_beale_isoud$ was made ready to go with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $dame_bragwaine$ went with her for her chief gentlewoman with many other
then the #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ #mother# gave to her and $dame_bragwaine$ her daughter gentlewoman and unto $gouvernail$ a drink and charged them that what #day# $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ should wed that same #day# they should give him that drink so that $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ should drink to $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and then said the #queen# i undertake either shall love other the #day# of their life
that is for to say if that #ye# list to we her so this drink was given unto $dame_bragwaine$ and unto $gouvernail$
and then anon sir $tristram_de_liones$ took the sea and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and when they were in their cabin it happed so that they were thirsty and they saw a little flasket of gold stand by them and it seemed by the colour and the taste that it was noble wine
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ took the flasket in his hand and said madam $lady_la_beale_isoud$ here is the best drink that ever #ye# drank that $dame_bragwaine$ your #maiden# and $gouvernail$ my servant have kept for themselves
then they laughed and made good #cheer# and either drank to other freely and they thought never drink that ever they drank to other was so sweet nor so good
but by that their drink was in their bodies they loved either other so well that never their love departed for weal neither for woe
and thus it happed the love first betwixt sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ the which love never departed the #day# of their life
they came #nigh# a castle that hight pluere and thereby arrived for to repose them weening to them to have had good harbourage
but anon as sir $tristram_de_liones$ was within the castle they were taken #prisoner# for the custom of the castle was such who that rode by that castle and brought any #lady# he must needs fight with the lord that hight $breunor_le_noire$
and if it were so that $breunor_le_noire$ won the field then should the $black_knight$ stranger and his #lady# be put to death what that ever they were and if it were so that the strange $black_knight$ won the field of sir $breunor_le_noire$ then should he die and his #lady# both
so then they sailed till by #fortune# this custom was used many winters for it was called the castle pluere that is to say the weeping castle
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ were in prison and how he fought for her beauty and smote of another #lady# #head#
chapter xxv thus as sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ were in prison it happed a $black_knight$ and a #lady# came unto them where they were to #cheer# them
i have #marvel# said $tristram_de_liones$ unto the $black_knight$ and the #lady# what is the #cause# the lord of this castle holdeth us in prison
it was never the custom of no place of worship that ever i came in when a $black_knight$ and a #lady# asked harbour and they to receive them and after to destroy them that be his guests
sir said the $black_knight$ this is the old custom of this castle that when a $black_knight$ cometh here he must needs fight with our lord and he that is weaker must lose his #head#
and when that is done if his #lady# that he bringeth be fouler than our lord #wife# she must lose her #head# and if she be fairer proved than is our #lady# then shall the #lady# of this castle lose her #head#
so god me #help# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ this is a foul custom and a shameful but one advantage have i said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i have a #lady# is fair enough
fairer saw i never in all my life #day# and i doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not lose her #head# and rather than i should lose my #head#
wherefore sir $black_knight$ i pray you tell your lord that i will be ready as to morn with my #lady# and myself to do battle if it be so
i will fight for it on a fair field i may have my horse and mine armour sir said that $black_knight$ i undertake that your desire shall be sped right well
and then he said take your #rest# and look that #ye# be up betimes and make you ready and your #lady# for #ye# shall want no #thing# that you behoveth
and therewith he departed and on the morn betimes that same $black_knight$ came to sir $tristram_de_liones$ and fetched him out and his #lady# and brought him horse and armour that was his own and bade him make him ready to the field for all the estates and commons of that lordship were there ready to behold that battle and judgment
then came sir $breunor_le_noire$ the lord of that castle with his #lady# in his hand muffled and asked sir $tristram_de_liones$ where was his #lady# for an thy #lady# be fairer than mine with thy sword smite off my #lady# #head# and if my #lady# be fairer than thine with my sword i must strike off her #head#
and if i may win thee yet shall thy #lady# be mine and thou shalt lose thy #head# sir said $tristram_de_liones$ this is a foul custom and horrible and rather than my #lady# should lose her #head# yet
had i liefer lose my #head# nay nay said sir $breunor_le_noire$ the #lady# shall be first showed together and the one shall have her judgment
but i doubt not said sir $tristram_de_liones$ my #lady# is fairer than thine and that will i prove and make good with my hand
nay i will not so said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for here is #none# that will give righteous judgment and whosomever he be that will say the contrary i will prove it on his #head#
and therewith sir $tristram_de_liones$ showed $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and turned her thrice about with his naked sword in his hand and when sir $breunor_le_noire$ saw that he did the same wise turn his #lady#
but when sir $breunor_le_noire$ beheld $lady_la_beale_isoud$ him thought he saw never a fairer #lady# and then he dread his #lady# #head# should be off
and so all the people that were there present gave judgment that $lady_la_beale_isoud$ was the fairer #lady# and the better made
how now said sir $tristram_de_liones$ meseemeth it were pity that my #lady# should lose her #head# but because thou and she of long time have used this wicked custom and by you both have many good #knight# and #lady# been destroyed for that #cause# it were no loss to destroy you both
so god me #help# said sir $breunor_le_noire$ for to say the sooth thy #lady# is fairer than mine and that me sore repenteth
and so i hear the people privily say for of all women i saw #none# so fair and therefore an thou wilt slay my #lady# i doubt
not but i shall slay thee and have thy #lady# thou shalt win her said sir $tristram_de_liones$ as dear as ever $black_knight$ won #lady#
and because of thine own judgment as thou wouldst have done to my #lady# if that she had been fouler and because of the evil custom give me thy #lady# said sir $tristram_de_liones$
and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ strode unto him and took his #lady# from him and with an awk #stroke# he smote off her #head# clean
well $black_knight$ said sir $breunor_le_noire$ now hast thou done me a despite now take thine horse sithen i am ladyless i will win thy #lady# an
i may printed by $william_caxton$ as part of chap #xxvi# chapter #xxvi# how sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought with sir $breunor_le_noire$ and at the last smote off his #head#
then they took their horses and came together as it had been the thunder and sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote sir $breunor_le_noire$ clean from his horse and lightly he rose up and as sir $tristram_de_liones$ came again by him
he thrust his horse throughout both the shoulders that his horse hurled here and there and fell dead to the ground
and ever sir $breunor_le_noire$ ran after to have slain sir $tristram_de_liones$ but sir $tristram_de_liones$ was light and nimble and voided his horse lightly
and or ever sir $tristram_de_liones$ might dress his shield and his sword the other gave him three or four sad #stroke#
for this sir $breunor_le_noire$ was a proved $black_knight$ and had been or then the death of many good #knight# that it was pity that he had so long endured
then they rushed together like two boars tracing and traversing mightily and wisely as two noble #knight# thus they fought hurling here and there #nigh# two hours and either were wounded sore
then at the last sir $breunor_le_noire$ rashed upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ and took him in his #arm# for he trusted much in his strength
then was sir $tristram_de_liones$ called the strongest and the highest $black_knight$ of the world for he was called bigger than sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was better breathed
and then all they that longed to the castle came to him and did him homage and fealty praying him that he would abide there still a little while to fordo that foul custom
so anon sir $tristram_de_liones$ thrust sir $breunor_le_noire$ down grovelling and then he unlaced his #helm# and struck off his #head# sir $tristram_de_liones$ granted thereto
the meanwhile one of the #knight# of the castle rode unto sir $galahad$ the haut prince the which was sir $breunor_le_noire$ son which was a noble $black_knight$ and told him what misadventure his father had and his #mother#
chapter xxvii how sir $galahad$ fought with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ yielded him and promised to fellowship with $launcelot_du_lake$
then came sir $galahad$ and the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# with him and this sir $galahad$ proffered to fight with sir $tristram_de_liones$ hand for hand
then sir $galahad$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ met together so hard that either bare other down horse and all to the earth
and then they avoided their horses as noble #knight# and dressed their shields and drew their swords with ire and rancour and they lashed together many sad #stroke# and one
while striking another while foining tracing and traversing as noble #knight# thus they fought long near half a #day# and either were sore wounded
at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ waxed light and big and doubled his #stroke# and drove sir $galahad$ aback on the one side and on the other so that he was like to have been slain
and so they made them ready to go unto battle on horseback with great courage with that came the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and all that fellowship went fiercely upon sir $tristram_de_liones$
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw them coming upon him then he wist well he might not endure then as a wise $black_knight$ of #war# he said to sir $galahad$ the haut prince
sir #ye# show to me no knighthood for to suffer all your men to have ado with me all at once and as meseemeth #ye# be a noble $black_knight$ of your hands it is great shame to you
so god me #help# said sir $galahad$ there is #none# other #way# but thou must yield thee to me other else to die said sir $galahad$ to sir $tristram_de_liones$
i will rather yield me to you than die for that is more for the might of your men than of your hands
and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his own sword by the point and put the pommel in the hand of sir $galahad$
let be said sir $galahad$ be #ye# not so hardy to touch him for i have given this $black_knight$ his life
therewithal came the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and hard began to assail sir $tristram_de_liones$ that is your shame said the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# hath he not slain your father and your #mother#
as for that said sir $galahad$ i may not wite him greatly for my father had him in prison and enforced him to do battle with him and my father had such a custom that was a shameful custom that what $black_knight$ came there to ask harbour his #lady# must needs die
but if she were fairer than my #mother# and if my father overcame that $black_knight$ he must needs die this was a shameful custom and usage a $black_knight$ for his harbour asking to have such harbourage
and for this custom i would never draw about him so god me #help# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ this was a shameful custom
truly said sir $galahad$ so seemed me and meseemed it had been great pity that this $black_knight$ should have been slain for i dare say he is the noblest man that beareth life but if it were sir $launcelot_du_lake$
now fair $black_knight$ said sir $galahad$ i require thee tell me thy name and of whence thou art and whither thou wilt
i was sent on message unto $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish of ireland for to fetch his daughter to be his #wife# and here she is ready to go with me into cornwall and her name is $lady_la_beale_isoud$
and sir $tristram_de_liones$ said sir $galahad$ the haut prince well be #ye# found in these marches and so #ye# will promise me to go unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and accompany with him #ye# shall go where #ye# will and your fair #lady# with you and
i shall promise you never in all my #day# shall such customs be used in this castle as have been used
sir he said my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ and from $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ of cornwall sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ now i let you #wit# so god me #help#
i weened #ye# had been sir $launcelot_du_lake$ when i saw you first and therefore i dread you the more and sir i promise you said sir $tristram_de_liones$ as soon as i may i will see sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and in fellowship me with him for of all the #knight# of the world i most desire his fellowship
chapter xxviii how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ met with sir $king_carados$ bearing away $sir_gawaine$ and of the rescue of $sir_gawaine$ and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his leave when he saw his time and took the sea
and in the meanwhile word came unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and to sir $tristram_de_liones$ that sir $king_carados$ the mighty $king_arthur_s_court$ that was made like a #giant# fought with $sir_gawaine$ and gave him such #stroke# that he swooned in his saddle and after that he took him by the collar and pulled him out of his saddle and fast bound him to the saddle bow and so rode his #way# with him toward his castle
and as he rode by #fortune# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ met with sir $king_carados$ and anon he knew $sir_gawaine$ that lay bound after him
ah said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ unto $sir_gawaine$ how stands it with you never so hard said $sir_gawaine$ unless that #ye# #help# me for so god me #help# without #ye# rescue me
i know no $black_knight$ that may but outher you or sir $tristram_de_liones$ wherefore sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was heavy of $sir_gawaine$ words
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ bade sir $king_carados$ lay down that $black_knight$ and fight with me thou art but a #fool# said sir $king_carados$ for i will serve you in the same wise
as for that said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ spare me not for i warn thee i will not spare thee and then he bound $sir_gawaine$ hand and foot and so threw him to the ground
and so either met with other and #brake# their spears to their hands and then they pulled out swords and hurtled together on horseback more than an hour
and then he gat his spear of his squire and departed from sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to fetch his course and at the last sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote sir $king_carados$ such a #buffet# upon the #helm# that it pierced his brain pan
so then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ took sir $king_carados$ by the collar and pulled him under his horse feet and then he alighted and pulled off his #helm# and struck off his #head#
so this same tale was told to sir $galahad$ and to sir $tristram_de_liones$ here may #ye# hear the nobleness that followeth sir $launcelot_du_lake$
i had not this message in hand with this fair #lady# truly i would never stint or i had found sir $launcelot_du_lake$
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ went to the sea and came into cornwall and there all the barons met them
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ unbound $sir_gawaine$ alas said sir $tristram_de_liones$ an chapter xxix of the #wedding# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ to $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and of $dame_bragwaine$ her maid and of $palamides_the_saracen$
and anon they were richly wedded with great noblesse but ever as the french book saith sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ loved ever together
then was there great jousts and great tourneying and many lords and #lady# were at that feast and sir $tristram_de_liones$ was most praised of all other
thus dured the feast long and after the feast was done within a little while after by the assent of two #lady# that were with #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy $dame_bragwaine$ that was #maiden# and #lady# unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and she was sent into the forest for to fetch herbs and there she was met and bound feet and hand to a tree
and by #fortune# sir $palamides_the_saracen$ found $dame_bragwaine$ and there he delivered her from the death and brought her to a nunnery there beside for to be recovered
and so she was bounden three #day# when $lady_la_beale_isoud$ the #queen# missed her #maiden# #wit# #ye# well she was right heavy as ever was any #queen# for of all earthly women she loved her best
and so upon a #day# #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ walked into the forest to put away her thoughts and there she went herself unto a well and made great moan
and suddenly there came $palamides_the_saracen$ to her and had heard all her #complaint# and said madam $lady_la_beale_isoud$ an #ye# will grant me my boon i shall bring to you $dame_bragwaine$ safe and sound
the #cause# was for she came with her out of her country and the #queen# was so glad of his proffer that suddenly unadvised she granted all his asking
well madam said $palamides_the_saracen$ i trust to your promise and if #ye# will abide here half an hour i shall bring her to you
and sir $palamides_the_saracen$ rode forth his #way# to that nunnery and lightly he came again with $dame_bragwaine$ but by her good will she would not have come again because for love of the #queen# she stood in adventure of her life
i shall abide you said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ notwithstanding half against her will she went with sir $palamides_the_saracen$ unto the #queen#
and when the #queen# saw her she was passing glad now madam said $palamides_the_saracen$ remember upon your promise for i have fulfilled my promise
sir $palamides_the_saracen$ said the #queen# i wot not what is your desire but i will that #ye# #wit# howbeit i promised you largely i thought #none# evil nor i warn you #none# evil will i do
madam said sir $palamides_the_saracen$ as at this time #ye# shall not know my desire but before my lord your husband there shall #ye# know that i will have my desire that #ye# have promised me
and when sir $palamides_the_saracen$ came before the $king_arthur_s_court$ he said sir $king_arthur_s_court$ i require you as #ye# be a righteous $king_arthur_s_court$ that #ye# will judge me the right
and therewith the #queen# departed and rode home to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $palamides_the_saracen$ rode after her tell me your #cause# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and #ye# shall have right
chapter xxx how $palamides_the_saracen$ demanded #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and how $lambegus$ rode after to rescue her and of the escape of $lady_la_beale_isoud$
sir said $palamides_the_saracen$ i promised your #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ to bring again $dame_bragwaine$ that she had lost upon this covenant that she should grant me a boon that i would ask and without grudging outher advisement she granted me
it is as he saith so god me #help# said the #queen# to say thee sooth i promised him his asking for love and joy that i had to see her
well madam said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and if #ye# were hasty to grant him what boon he would ask i will well that
then said $palamides_the_saracen$ i will that #ye# #wit# that i will have your #queen# to lead her and govern her whereas me list
what say #ye# my #lady# said the $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# perform your promise therewith the $king_arthur_s_court$ stood still and bethought him of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and deemed that he would rescue her
and then hastily the $king_arthur_s_court$ answered take her with the adventures that shall fall of it for as i suppose thou wilt not enjoy her no while
and so to make short tale sir $palamides_the_saracen$ took her by the hand and said madam grudge not to go with me for i desire nothing but your own promise
as for that said the #queen# i fear not greatly to go with thee howbeit thou hast me at advantage upon my promise for i doubt not i shall be worshipfully rescued from thee
as for that said $palamides_the_saracen$ i dare right well abide the adventure as for that said sir $palamides_the_saracen$ be it as it be may
anon the $king_arthur_s_court$ sent after sir $tristram_de_liones$ but in no wise he could be found for he was in the forest a hunting for that was always his custom but if he used #arm# to chase and to hunt in the forests
alas said the $king_arthur_s_court$ now i am shamed for ever that by mine own assent my #lady# and my #queen# shall be devoured
so #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ was set behind $palamides_the_saracen$ and rode his #way# then came forth a $black_knight$ his name was $lambegus$ and he was a $black_knight$ of sir $tristram_de_liones$
my lord said this $black_knight$ sith #ye# have trust in my lord sir $tristram_de_liones$ #wit# #ye# well for his sake i will ride after your #queen# and rescue her or else i shall be beaten
gramercy said the $king_arthur_s_court$ as i live sir $lambegus$ i shall deserve it and then sir $lambegus$ armed him and rode after as fast as he might
and then within a while he overtook sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and then sir $palamides_the_saracen$ left the #queen# what art thou said $palamides_the_saracen$ art thou $tristram_de_liones$
nay he said i am his servant and my name is sir $lambegus$ that me repenteth said $palamides_the_saracen$ i had liefer thou hadst been sir $tristram_de_liones$
and then they hurtled together and all to brast their spears and then they pulled out their swords and hewed on #helm# and hauberks
at the last sir $palamides_the_saracen$ gave sir $lambegus$ such a #wound# that he fell down like a dead $black_knight$ to the earth
i believe you well said $lambegus$ but when thou meetest with sir $tristram_de_liones$ thou shalt have thy hands full then he looked after $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and then she was gone
so the #queen# ran into the forest and there she found a well and therein she had thought to have drowned herself
and as good #fortune# would there came a $black_knight$ to her that had a castle thereby his name was sir adtherp
he nist where #wit# #ye# well sir $palamides_the_saracen$ was never so heavy and when he found the #queen# in that mischief he rescued her and brought her to his castle
and when he wist what she was he armed him and took his horse and said he would be avenged upon $palamides_the_saracen$ and so he rode on till he met with him and there sir $palamides_the_saracen$ wounded him sore and by #force# he made him to tell him the #cause# why he did battle with him and how he had led the #queen# unto his castle
now bring me there said $palamides_the_saracen$ or thou shalt die of my hands sir said sir adtherp i am so wounded i may not follow but ride you this #way#
and it shall bring you into my castle and there within is the #queen# then sir $palamides_the_saracen$ rode still till he came to the castle
and when he saw he might not come within the castle he put off his bridle and his saddle and put his horse to pasture and set himself down at the gate like a man that was out of his #wit# that recked not of himself
and at a window $lady_la_beale_isoud$ saw sir $palamides_the_saracen$ then she made the gates to be shut strongly chapter xxxi
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode after $palamides_the_saracen$ and how he found him and fought with him and by the #mean# of $lady_la_beale_isoud$ the battle ceased
now turn we unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that when he was come home and wist $lady_la_beale_isoud$ was gone with sir $palamides_the_saracen$ #wit# #ye# well he was wroth out of measure
alas said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i am this #day# shamed then he cried to $gouvernail$ his man haste thee that i were armed and on horseback
for well i wot $lambegus$ hath no might nor strength to withstand sir $palamides_the_saracen$ alas that i have not been in his stead
so anon as he was armed and horsed sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $gouvernail$ rode after into the forest and within a while he found his $black_knight$ $lambegus$ almost wounded to the death and sir $tristram_de_liones$ bare him to a forester and charged him to keep him well
and then he rode forth and there he found sir adtherp sore wounded and he told him how the #queen# would have drowned herself had he not been and how for her sake and love he had taken upon him to do battle with sir $palamides_the_saracen$
where is my #lady# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir said the $black_knight$ she is sure enough within my castle an she can hold her within it
and so he rode till he came #nigh# to that castle and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw where sir $palamides_the_saracen$ sat at the gate sleeping and his horse pastured fast afore him
gramercy said sir $tristram_de_liones$ of thy great goodness now go thou $gouvernail$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and bid him awake and make him ready
so $gouvernail$ rode unto him and said sir $palamides_the_saracen$ arise and take to thee thine harness but he was in such a study he heard not what $gouvernail$ said
so $gouvernail$ came again and told sir $tristram_de_liones$ he slept or else he was mad go thou again said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and bid him arise and tell him that i am here his mortal foe
so $gouvernail$ rode again and put upon him the butt of his spear and said sir $palamides_the_saracen$ make thee ready for #wit# #ye# well sir $tristram_de_liones$ hoveth yonder and sendeth thee word he is thy mortal foe
and therewithal sir $palamides_the_saracen$ arose stilly without words and gat his horse and saddled him and bridled him and lightly he leapt upon and gat his spear in his hand and either feutred their spears and hurtled fast together and there $tristram_de_liones$ smote down sir $palamides_the_saracen$ over his horse tail
and there began strong battle on both parts for both they fought for the love of one #lady# and ever she lay on the walls and beheld them how they fought out of measure and either were wounded passing sore but $palamides_the_saracen$ was much sorer wounded
then lightly sir $palamides_the_saracen$ put his shield afore him and drew his sword thus they fought tracing and traversing more than two hours that well #nigh# for dole and #sorrow# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ swooned
alas she said that one i loved and yet do and the other i love not yet it were great pity that i should see sir $palamides_the_saracen$ slain for well i know by that time the end be done sir $palamides_the_saracen$ is but a dead $black_knight$ because he is not christened i would be loath that he should die a $palamides_the_saracen$
and therewithal she came down and besought sir $tristram_de_liones$ to fight no more ah madam said he what #mean# you will #ye# have me shamed
i will not your dishonour said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ but i would that #ye# would for my sake spare this unhappy $palamides_the_saracen$ $palamides_the_saracen$
well #ye# know i will be ruled by you madam said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will leave fighting at this time for your sake
then she said to sir $palamides_the_saracen$ this shall be your charge that thou shalt go out of this country while i am therein
then take thy #way# said $lady_la_beale_isoud$ unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and there recommend me unto #queen# $dame_guenever$ and tell her that i send her word that there be within this #land# but four lovers that is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and #queen# $dame_guenever$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ and #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$
i will obey your commandment said sir $palamides_the_saracen$ the which is sore against my will chapter xxxii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ brought #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ home and of the debate of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$
and sir $tristram_de_liones$ took the #queen# and brought her again to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and then was there made great joy of her home coming
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ let fetch sir $lambegus$ his $black_knight$ from the forester house and it was long or he was whole but at the last he was well recovered
and so sir $palamides_the_saracen$ departed with great heaviness who was cherished but sir $tristram_de_liones$ thus they lived with joy and play a long while
but ever sir $andred$ that was #nigh# cousin to sir $tristram_de_liones$ lay in a watch to wait betwixt sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ for to take them and slander them
so upon a #day# sir $tristram_de_liones$ talked with $lady_la_beale_isoud$ in a window and that espied sir $andred$ and told it to the $king_arthur_s_court$
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ took a sword in his hand and came to sir $tristram_de_liones$ and called him false traitor and would have stricken him
but sir $tristram_de_liones$ was #nigh# him and ran under his sword and took it out of his hand and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ cried
where are my #knight# and my men i charge you slay this traitor but at that time there was not one would move for his words
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw that there was not one would be against him he shook the sword to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and made #countenance# as though he would have stricken him
and then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ fled and sir $tristram_de_liones$ followed him and smote upon him five or six #stroke# flatling on the #neck# that he made him to fall upon the nose
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ yede his #way# and armed him and took his horse and his man and so he rode into that forest
and there upon a #day# sir $tristram_de_liones$ met with two brethren that were #knight# with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and there he struck off the #head# of the one and wounded the other to the death and he made him to bear his brother #head# in his #helm# unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ and thirty more there he wounded
and when that $black_knight$ came before the $king_arthur_s_court$ to say his message he there died afore the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen#
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ called his council unto him and asked advice of his barons what was best to do with sir $tristram_de_liones$
sir said the barons in especial sir $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ sir we will give you counsel for to send for sir $tristram_de_liones$ for we will that #ye# #wit# many men will hold with sir $tristram_de_liones$
and sir said sir $dinas$ #ye# shall understand that sir $tristram_de_liones$ is called peerless and makeless of any christian $black_knight$ and of his might and hardiness we knew #none# so good a $black_knight$ but if it be sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and if he depart from your #court# and go to $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# #wit# #ye# well he will get him such friends there that he will not set by your malice
an he were hard bestead and therefore sir i counsel you to take him to your grace i will well said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that he be sent for that we may be friends
and so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ came to the $king_arthur_s_court$ he was welcome and no rehearsal was made and there was game and play
then the barons sent for sir $tristram_de_liones$ under a safe conduct and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# went a hunting and sir $tristram_de_liones$
chapter xxxiii how sir $lamorak_de_galis$ jousted with thirty #knight# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ at the request of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ smote his horse down
the $king_arthur_s_court$ and the #queen# made their #pavilion# and their tents in that forest beside a river and there was daily hunting and jousting for there were ever thirty #knight# ready to joust unto all them that came in at that time
and there by #fortune# came sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and sir driant and there sir driant jousted right well but at the last he had a fall
and when he began he fared so with the thirty #knight# that there was not one of them but that he gave him a fall and some of them were sore #hurt#
then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ proffered to joust i #marvel# said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ what $black_knight$ he is that doth such deeds of #arm#
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i know him well for a noble $black_knight$ as few now be living and his name is sir $lamorak_de_galis$
it were great shame said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that he should go thus away unless that some of you meet with him better
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ meseemeth it were no worship for a noble man to have ado with him and for because at this time he hath done over much for any #mean# $black_knight$ living therefore as meseemeth it were great shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time insomuch as he and his horse are weary both for the deeds of #arm# that he hath done this #day# an they be well considered it were enough for sir $launcelot_du_lake$
as for that said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ i require you as #ye# love me and my #lady# the #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ take your #arm# and joust with sir $lamorak_de_galis$
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ #ye# bid me do a #thing# that is against knighthood and well i can deem that i shall give him a fall for it is no mastery for my horse
and i be fresh both and so is not his horse and he and #wit# #ye# well that he will take it for great unkindness for
ever one good $black_knight$ is loath to take another at disadvantage but because i will not displease you as #ye# require me so will i do and obey your commandment
and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ armed him and took his horse and put him forth and there sir $lamorak_de_galis$ met him mightily and what with the might of his own spear and of sir $tristram_de_liones$ spear sir $lamorak_de_galis$ horse fell to the earth and he sitting in the saddle
then anon as lightly as he might he avoided the saddle and his horse and put his shield afore him and drew his sword
nay said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will no more have ado with thee for i have done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship
and then he bade sir $tristram_de_liones$ alight thou $black_knight$ an thou durst as for that said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i can thee no thank since thou hast for jousted me on horseback
i require thee and i beseech thee an thou be sir $tristram_de_liones$ fight with me on foot i will not so said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and #wit# #ye#
well my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ and well i know #ye# be sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and this that i have done to you was against my will but i was required thereto but to say that i will do at your request as at this time i will have no more ado with you for me shameth of that i have done
as for the shame said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ on thy part or on mine bear thou it an thou wilt for though a mare son hath failed me now a #queen# son shall not fail thee and therefore an thou be such a $black_knight$ as men call thee
sir $lamorak_de_galis$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i understand your heart is great and #cause# why #ye# have to say thee sooth for it would grieve me an any $black_knight$ should keep him fresh and then to strike down a weary $black_knight$ for that $black_knight$ nor horse was never formed that alway might stand or endure
i require thee alight and fight with me and therefore said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will not have ado with you for me forthinketh of that i have done
how sir $lamorak_de_galis$ sent an horn to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ in despite of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ was driven into a #chapel#
so he departed from him with sir driant and by the #way# they met with a $black_knight$ that was sent from $queen_morgan_le_fay$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and this $black_knight$ had a fair horn harnessed with gold and the horn had such a virtue that there might no #lady# nor gentlewoman drink of that horn
but if she were true to her husband and if she were false she should spill all the drink and if she were true to her lord she might drink peaceable
and because of the #queen# $dame_guenever$ and in the despite of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ this horn was sent unto $king_arthur_s_court$ and by #force# sir $lamorak_de_galis$ made that $black_knight$ to tell all the #cause# why he bare that horn
as for that said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i shall quit you an ever i see my time chapter xxxiv now shalt thou bear this horn said $lamorak_de_galis$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ or else choose thou to die for it
for i tell thee plainly in despite and reproof of sir $tristram_de_liones$ thou shalt bear that horn unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ his uncle and say thou to him that i sent it him for to assay his #lady# and if she be true to him he shall prove her
so the $black_knight$ went his #way# unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and brought him that rich horn and said that sir $lamorak_de_galis$ sent it him and thereto he told him the virtue of that horn
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ made #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ to drink thereof and an hundred #lady# and there were but four #lady# of all those that drank clean
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ this is a great despite and sware a great #oath# that she should be burnt and the other #lady#
then the barons gathered them together and said plainly they would not have those #lady# burnt for an horn made by sorcery that came from as false a sorceress and witch as then was living
for that horn did never good but caused strife and debate and always in her #day# she had been an #enemy# to all true lovers
so there were many #knight# made their avow an ever they met with $queen_morgan_le_fay$ that they would show her short courtesy
also sir $tristram_de_liones$ was passing wroth that sir $lamorak_de_galis$ sent that horn unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ for well he knew that it was done in the despite of him
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ used daily and nightly to go to #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ when he might and ever sir $andred$ his cousin watched him night and #day# for to take him with $lady_la_beale_isoud$
and therefore he thought to quite sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and so upon a night sir $andred$ espied the hour and the time when sir $tristram_de_liones$ went to his #lady#
then sir $andred$ gat unto him twelve #knight# and at midnight he set upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ secretly and suddenly and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ was taken naked abed with $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and then was he bound hand and foot and
and then by the assent of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and of sir $andred$ and of some of the barons sir $tristram_de_liones$ was led unto a #chapel# that stood upon the sea rocks there for to take his judgment and so he was led bounden with forty #knight#
and when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw that there was #none# other boot but needs that he must die then said he fair lords remember what i have done for the country of cornwall and in what jeopardy i have been in for the weal of you all for when i fought for the #truage# of cornwall with sir $marhaus$ the good $black_knight$ i was promised for to be better rewarded when #ye# all refused to take the battle therefore as #ye# be good gentle #knight# see me not thus shamefully to die for it is shame to all knighthood thus to see me die for i dare say said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that i never met with no $black_knight$
fie upon thee said sir $andred$ false traitor that thou art with thine avaunting for all thy boast thou shalt die this #day#
o $andred$ andred said sir $tristram_de_liones$ thou shouldst be my kinsman and now thou art to me full unfriendly but an there were no more but thou
so was he kept until #day# but i was as good as he or better and i thou wouldst not put me to death
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw him make such #countenance# he looked upon both his hands that were fast bounden unto two #knight# and suddenly he pulled them both to him and unwrast his hands and then he leapt unto his cousin sir $andred$ and wrested his sword out of his hands then he smote sir $andred$ that he fell to the earth and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought till that he had killed ten #knight#
no said sir $andred$ and therewith he drew his sword and would have slain him so then sir $tristram_de_liones$ gat the #chapel# and kept it mightily
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw the people draw unto him he remembered he was naked and sperd fast the #chapel# door and #brake# the bars of a window and so he leapt out and fell upon the crags in the sea
then the cry was great and the people drew fast unto sir $andred$ mo than an hundred and so at that time sir $andred$ nor #none# of his fellows might get to him at that time
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ was holpen by his men and of #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ which was put in a lazar cote and how $tristram_de_liones$ was #hurt#
so when they were departed $gouvernail$ and sir $lambegus$ and sir sentraille de lushon that were sir $tristram_de_liones$ men sought their #master#
when they heard he was escaped then they were passing glad and on the rocks they found him and with towels they pulled him up
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ asked them where was $lady_la_beale_isoud$ for he weened she had been had away of $andred$ people
alas said sir $tristram_de_liones$ this is a full ungoodly place for such a fair #lady# and if i may she shall not be long there
and so he took his men and went thereas was $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and fetched her away and brought her into a forest to a fair manor and sir $tristram_de_liones$ there abode with her
chapter xxxv sir said $gouvernail$ she is put in a lazar cote so the good $black_knight$ bade his men go from him for at this time i may not #help# you
and so upon a #day# sir $tristram_de_liones$ yede into the forest for to disport him and then it happened that there he fell sleep and there came a man that sir $tristram_de_liones$ aforehand had slain his brother and when this man had found him he shot him through the shoulder with an arrow and sir $tristram_de_liones$ leapt up and killed that man
and in the meantime it was told $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ how sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ were in that same manor and as soon as ever he might thither he came with many #knight# to slay sir $tristram_de_liones$
and when he came there he found him gone and there he took $lady_la_beale_isoud$ home with him and kept her strait that by no #mean# never she might #wit# nor send unto $tristram_de_liones$ nor he unto her
and then when sir $tristram_de_liones$ came toward the old manor he found the track of many horses and thereby he wist his #lady# was gone
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ took great #sorrow# and endured with great pain long time for the arrow that he was #hurt# withal was envenomed
she told a #lady# that was cousin unto $dame_bragwaine$ and she came to sir $tristram_de_liones$ and told him that he might not be whole by no #mean#
for thy $lady_la_beale_isoud$ may not #help# thee therefore she biddeth you haste into brittany to $king_arthur_s_court$ howel and there #ye# shall find his daughter $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ and she shall #help# thee
so they departed all save $gouvernail$ then by the #mean# of $lady_la_beale_isoud$ then sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $gouvernail$ gat them shipping and so sailed into brittany
sir he said i am come into this country to have #help# of your daughter for it is told me that there is #none# other may heal me but she and so within a while she healed him
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ howel wist that it was sir $tristram_de_liones$ he was full glad of him chapter xxxvi how sir $tristram_de_liones$ served in #war# $king_arthur_s_court$ howel of brittany and slew his adversary in the field
there was an earl that hight grip and this earl made great #war# upon the $king_arthur_s_court$ and put the $king_arthur_s_court$ to the worse and besieged him
and on a time sir $kehydius$ that was son to $king_arthur_s_court$ howel as he issued out he was sore wounded #nigh# to the death
then $gouvernail$ went to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and said sir i counsel you to desire my lord sir $tristram_de_liones$ as in your need to #help# you
and so he yede unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ and prayed him in his #war# to #help# him for my son sir $kehydius$ may not go into the field
i will do by your counsel said the $king_arthur_s_court$ sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will go to the field and do what i may
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ issued out of the town with such fellowship as he might make and did such deeds that all brittany spake of him
and then at the last by great might and #force# he slew the earl grip with his own hands and more than an hundred #knight# he slew that #day#
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ was received worshipfully with procession then $king_arthur_s_court$ howel embraced him in his #arm# and said sir $tristram_de_liones$ all my kingdom i will resign to thee
then by the great #mean# of $king_arthur_s_court$ howel and $kehydius$ his son by great proffers there grew great love betwixt $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ for that #lady# was both good and fair and a woman of noble blood and fame
and for because sir $tristram_de_liones$ had such #cheer# and riches and all other pleasaunce that he had almost he had forsaken $lady_la_beale_isoud$
god defend said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for i am beholden unto you for your daughter sake to do for you and so upon a time sir $tristram_de_liones$ agreed to wed $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$
and at the last they were wedded and solemnly held their marriage and so when they were abed both sir $tristram_de_liones$ remembered him of his old $lady_la_beale_isoud$
and then he took such a thought suddenly that he was all dismayed and other #cheer# made he #none# but with clipping and kissing as for other fleshly lusts sir $tristram_de_liones$ never thought nor had ado with her such mention maketh the french book also it maketh mention that the #lady# weened there had been no pleasure but kissing and clipping
his name was suppinabiles and he came over the sea into england and then he came into the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and there he met with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and told him of the marriage of sir $tristram_de_liones$
fie upon him untrue $black_knight$ to his #lady# that so noble a $black_knight$ as sir $tristram_de_liones$ is should be found to his first #lady# false $lady_la_beale_isoud$ #queen# of cornwall but say #ye# him this said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that of all #knight# in the world i loved him most and had most joy of him and all was for his noble deeds and let him #wit# the love between him and me is done for ever and that i give him warning from this #day# forth as his mortal #enemy#
and in the meantime there was a $black_knight$ in brittany then said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ chapter xxxvii how sir suppinabiles told sir $tristram_de_liones$ how he was defamed in the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and of sir $lamorak_de_galis$
then departed sir suppinabiles unto brittany again and there he found sir $tristram_de_liones$ and told him that he had been in $king_arthur_s_court$ #court#
then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard #ye# anything of me so god me #help# said sir suppinabiles there i heard sir $launcelot_du_lake$ speak of you great shame and that #ye# be a false $black_knight$ to your #lady#
and he bade me do you to #wit# that he will be your mortal #enemy# in every place where he may meet you
so sir $tristram_de_liones$ made great moan and was ashamed that noble #knight# should defame him for the sake of his #lady#
and in this meanwhile $lady_la_beale_isoud$ made a letter unto #queen# $dame_guenever$ complaining her of the untruth of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and how he had wedded the $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter of brittany
#queen# $dame_guenever$ sent her another letter and bade her be of good #cheer# for she should have joy after #sorrow# for sir $tristram_de_liones$ was so noble a $black_knight$ called that by crafts of sorcery #lady# would make such noble men to wed them
but in the end #queen# $dame_guenever$ said it shall be thus that he shall hate her and love you better than ever he did to #fore#
so leave we sir $tristram_de_liones$ in brittany and speak we of sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that as he sailed his ship fell on a rock and perished all save sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and his squire and there he swam mightily and fishers of the isle of servage took him up and his squire was drowned and the shipmen had great labour to save sir $lamorak_de_galis$ life for all the comfort that they could do
that me repenteth said $tristram_de_liones$ for of all #knight# i loved to be in his fellowship and the lord of that isle hight sir $nabon$ le $breunor_le_noire$ a great mighty #giant#
and this sir $nabon$ hated all the #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and in no wise he would do them favour and these fishers told sir $lamorak_de_galis$ all the guise of sir $nabon$ how there came never $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ s
and at the last battle that he did was slain sir nanowne le petite the which he put to a shameful death in despite of $king_arthur_s_court$ for he was drawn limb meal
that forthinketh me said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ for that $black_knight$ death for he was my cousin and if i were at mine ease as well as ever i was i would revenge his death
#peace# said the fishers and make here no words for or ever #ye# depart from hence sir $nabon$ must know that #ye# have been here or else we should die for your sake
so that i be whole said $lamorak_de_galis$ of my disease that i have taken in the sea i will that #ye# tell him that i am a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ for i was never afeard to reneye my lord
but he destroyed him chapter xxxviii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ and his #wife# arrived in wales and how he met there with sir $lamorak_de_galis$
now turn we unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that upon a #day# he took a little barget and his #wife# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ with sir $kehydius$ her brother to play them in the coasts
and when they were from the #land# there was a wind drove them in to the coast of wales upon this isle of servage whereas was sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and there the barget all to rove and there dame $lady_la_beale_isoud$ was #hurt# and as well as they might they gat into the forest and there by a well he saw $segwarides$ and a $damosel_of_the_lake$
sir said $segwarides$ i know you for sir $tristram_de_liones$ the man in the world that i have most #cause# to hate because #ye# departed the love between me and my #wife# but as for that said sir $segwarides$ i will never hate a noble $black_knight$ for a light #lady# and therefore i pray you be my friend and i will be yours unto my power for #wit# #ye# well #ye# are hard bestead in this #valley# and we shall have enough to do either of us to succour other
and then sir $segwarides$ brought sir $tristram_de_liones$ to a #lady# thereby that was born in cornwall and she told him all the perils of that #valley# and how there came never $black_knight$ there
#wit# you well fair #lady# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that i slew sir $marhaus$ and delivered cornwall from the #truage# of ireland and i am he that delivered the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland from sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and i am he that beat sir $palamides_the_saracen$ and #wit#
and then either saluted other but he were taken #prisoner# or slain #ye# well i am sir $tristram_de_liones$ that by the grace of god shall deliver this woful isle of servage
so sir $tristram_de_liones$ was well eased then one told him there was a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ that was wrecked on the rocks
we wot not said the fishers but he keepeth it no counsel but that he is a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ and by the mighty lord of this isle he setteth nought
may bring him hither that i may see him and if he be any of the #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ i shall know him
what is his name said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i pray you said sir $tristram_de_liones$ an #ye# then the #lady# prayed the fishers to bring him to her place
so on the morrow they brought him thither in a fisher raiment and as soon as sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw him he smiled upon him and knew him well but he knew not sir $tristram_de_liones$
fair sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ meseemeth by your #cheer# #ye# have been diseased but late and also methinketh i should know you heretofore
i will well said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that #ye# have seen me and met with me fair sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ tell me your name
upon a covenant i will tell you said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that is that #ye# will tell me whether #ye# be lord of this island or no that is called $nabon$ le $breunor_le_noire$
forsooth said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i am not he nor i hold not of him i am his foe as well as #ye# be and so shall i be found
well said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ since #ye# have said so largely unto me my name is sir $lamorak_de_galis$ son unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_pellinore$
or i depart out of this isle forsooth i trow well said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for an #ye# said other i know the contrary
ah sir remember #ye# not of the fall #ye# did give me once and after #ye# refused me to fight on foot
that was not for fear i had of you said sir $tristram_de_liones$ but me shamed at that time to have more ado with you for meseemed #ye# had enough but sir $lamorak_de_galis$ for my kindness many #lady# #ye# put to a reproof when #ye# sent the horn from $queen_morgan_le_fay$ to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ whereas #ye# did this in despite of me
what are #ye# said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that knoweth me i am sir $tristram_de_liones$ well said he an it were to do again so would i do for i had
liefer strife and debate fell in $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ #court# rather than $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# for the honour of both #court# be not alike
as to that said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i know well but that that was done it was for despite of me but all your malice i thank god #hurt# not greatly
therefore said sir $tristram_de_liones$ #ye# shall leave all your malice and so will i and let us assay how we may win worship between you and me upon this #giant# sir $nabon$ le $breunor_le_noire$ that is lord of this island to destroy him
sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ now i understand your knighthood it may not be false that all men say for of your bounty noblesse and worship of all #knight# #ye# are peerless and for your courtesy and gentleness i showed you ungentleness and that now me repenteth
in the meantime there came word that sir $nabon$ had made a cry that all the people of that isle should be at his castle the fifth #day# after
and the same #day# the son of $nabon$ should be made $black_knight$ and all the #knight# of that #valley# and thereabout should be there to joust and all those of the realm of logris should be there to joust with them of north wales and thither came five hundred #knight# and they of the country brought thither sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $kehydius$ and sir $segwarides$ for they durst #none# otherwise do and then sir $nabon$ lent sir $lamorak_de_galis$ horse and armour at sir $lamorak_de_galis$ desire and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ jousted and did such deeds of #arm# that $nabon$ and all the people said there was never $black_knight$ that ever they saw do such deeds of #arm# for as the french book saith he for jousted all that were there for the most part of five hundred #knight# that #none# abode him in his saddle
chapter xxxix how sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought with sir $nabon$ and overcame him and made sir $segwarides$ lord of the isle then sir $nabon$ proffered to play with him his play
for i saw never no $black_knight$ do so much upon a #day# i will well said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ play as i may but i am weary and sore bruised
and there either gat a spear but $nabon$ would not encounter with sir $lamorak_de_galis$ but smote his horse in the forehead and so slew him and then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ yede on foot and turned his shield and drew his sword and there began strong battle on foot
but sir $lamorak_de_galis$ was so sore bruised and short breathed that he traced and traversed somewhat aback fair fellow said sir $nabon$ hold thy hand
and i shall show thee more courtesy than ever i showed $black_knight$ because i have seen this #day# thy noble knighthood and therefore stand thou by and i will #wit# whether any of thy fellows will have ado with me
then when sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard that he stepped forth and said $nabon$ lend me horse and sure armour and i will have ado with thee
well fellow said sir $nabon$ go thou to yonder #pavilion# and #arm# thee of the best thou findest there and i shall play a marvellous play with thee
then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ look #ye# play well or else peradventure i shall learn you a new play that is well said fellow said sir $nabon$
so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was armed as him liked best and well shielded and sworded he dressed to him on foot for well he knew that sir $nabon$ would not abide a #stroke# with a spear therefore he would slay all #knight# horses
now fair fellow sir $nabon$ let us play so then they fought long on foot tracing and traversing smiting and foining long without any #rest#
at the last sir $nabon$ prayed him to tell him his name sir $nabon$ i tell thee my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ a $black_knight$ of cornwall under $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
thou art welcome said sir $nabon$ for of all #knight# i have most desired to fight with thee or with sir $launcelot_du_lake$
so then they went eagerly together and sir $tristram_de_liones$ slew sir $nabon$ and so forthwith he leapt to his son and struck off his #head# and then all the country said they would hold of sir $tristram_de_liones$
nay said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will not so here is a worshipful $black_knight$ sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that for me he shall be lord of this country for he hath done here great deeds of #arm#
nay said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i will not be lord of this country for i have not deserved it as well as #ye#
therefore give #ye# it where #ye# will for i will #none# have well said sir $tristram_de_liones$ since #ye# nor i will not have it
let us give it to him that hath not so well deserved it do as #ye# list said $segwarides$ for the gift is yours for i will #none# have an
so was it given to $segwarides$ whereof he thanked them and so was he lord and worshipfully he did govern it
and then sir $segwarides$ delivered all #prisoner# and set good governance in that #valley# and so he returned into cornwall and told $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and $lady_la_beale_isoud$ how sir $tristram_de_liones$ had advanced him to the isle of servage and there he proclaimed in all cornwall of all the adventures of these two #knight# so was it openly known
but full woe was $lady_la_beale_isoud$ when she heard tell that sir $tristram_de_liones$ was wedded to $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$
i had deserved it chapter xl how sir $lamorak_de_galis$ departed from sir $tristram_de_liones$ and how he met with sir $frol$ and after with sir $launcelot_du_lake$
so turn we unto sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that rode toward $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ #wife# and $kehydius$ took a vessel and sailed into brittany unto $king_arthur_s_court$ howel where he was welcome
now turn we unto sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that when he was departed from sir $tristram_de_liones$ he rode out of the forest till he came to an hermitage
and when he heard of these adventures they marvelled of his noble deeds when the hermit saw him he asked him from whence he came
sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i come from this #valley# sir said the hermit thereof i #marvel# for this twenty winter i saw never no $black_knight$ pass this country
but he was either slain or villainously wounded or pass as a poor #prisoner# those ill customs said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ are fordone for sir $tristram_de_liones$ slew your lord sir $nabon$ and his son
then was the hermit glad and all his brethren for he said there was never such a tyrant among christian men
so on the morrow sir $lamorak_de_galis$ departed and as he rode he saw four #knight# fight against one and that one $black_knight$ defended him well but at the last the four #knight# had him down
and then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ went betwixt them and asked them why they would slay that one $black_knight$ and said it was shame four against one
and therefore said the hermit this #valley# and franchise we will hold of sir $tristram_de_liones$ thou shalt well #wit# said the four #knight# that he is false
that is your tale said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and when i hear him also speak i will say as #ye# say then said $lamorak_de_galis$ ah $black_knight$ can #ye# not excuse you but that #ye# are a false $black_knight$
can i excuse me both with my word and with my hands that i will make good upon one of the best of them my body to his body
sir said he yet then spake they all at once we will not jeopardy our bodies as for thee but #wit# thou well
that is too much said said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ but many speak behind a man more than they will say to his face and because of your words #ye# shall understand that i am one of the simplest of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# in the worship of my lord now do your best and in despite of you i shall rescue him
and then they lashed all at once to sir $lamorak_de_galis$ but anon at two #stroke# sir $lamorak_de_galis$ had slain two of them and then the other two fled
they said an $king_arthur_s_court$ were here himself it should not lie in his power to save his life so then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ turned again to that $black_knight$ and asked him his name
sir he said my name is sir $frol$ of the out isles then he rode with sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and bare him company
and as they rode by the #way# they saw a seemly $black_knight$ riding against them and all in white ah said $frol$ yonder $black_knight$ jousted late with me and smote me down therefore i will joust with him
#ye# shall not do so said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ by my counsel an #ye# will tell me your quarrel whether #ye# jousted at his request or he at yours
sir said $lamorak_de_galis$ then will i counsel you deal no more with him for meseemeth by his #countenance# he should be a noble $black_knight$ and no japer for methinketh he should be of the table round
nay said sir $frol$ i jousted with him at my request therefore i will not spare said sir $frol$ and then he cried and said sir $black_knight$ make thee ready to joust
that needeth not said the white $black_knight$ for i have no lust to joust with thee but yet they feutred their spears and the white $black_knight$ overthrew sir $frol$
then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ rode after him and prayed him to tell him his name for meseemeth #ye# should be of the fellowship of the round table
upon a covenant said he i will tell you my name so that #ye# will not discover my name and also that #ye# will tell me yours
and then he rode his #way# a soft pace then said he my name is sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and my name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$
then they put up their swords and kissed heartily together and either made great joy of other sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ an it please you
i will do you service god defend said $launcelot_du_lake$ that any of so noble a blood as #ye# be should do me service
then he said more i am in a #quest# that i must do myself alone now god speed you said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and so they departed
then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ came to sir $frol$ and horsed him again what $black_knight$ is that said sir $frol$ sir he said it is not for you to know nor it is no point of my charge
#ye# may do as #ye# list said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and yet by my company #ye# have saved the fairest flower of your garland so they departed
#ye# are the more uncourteous said sir $frol$ and therefore i will depart from you chapter xli how sir $lamorak_de_galis$ slew sir $frol$ and of the courteous fighting with sir belliance his brother
then within two or three #day# sir $lamorak_de_galis$ found a $black_knight$ at a well sleeping and his #lady# sat with him and waked
right so came $sir_gawaine$ and took the $black_knight$ #lady# and set her up behind his squire so sir $lamorak_de_galis$ rode after $sir_gawaine$ and said $sir_gawaine$ turn again
sir said he for that #cause# i will spare you else that #lady# should abide with me or else #ye# should joust with me
then $sir_gawaine$ turned him and ran to him that ought the #lady# with his spear but the $black_knight$ with pure might smote down $sir_gawaine$ and took his #lady# with him
and then said $sir_gawaine$ what will #ye# do with me for i am nephew unto $king_arthur_s_court$ all this sir $lamorak_de_galis$ saw and said to himself
but i revenge my fellow he will say of me dishonour in $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ returned and proffered that $black_knight$ to joust
and there they came together with all their might and there sir $lamorak_de_galis$ smote the $black_knight$ through both sides that he fell to the earth dead
then that #lady# rode to that $black_knight$ brother that hight belliance le orgulus that dwelt fast thereby and then she told him how his brother was slain
and so he horsed him and armed him and within a while he overtook sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and bade him turn and leave that #lady# for thou
and i must play a new play for thou hast slain my brother sir $frol$ that was a better $black_knight$ than ever wert thou
sir said he i am ready alas said he i will be revenged it might well be said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ but this #day# in the field i was found the better
so they rode together and unhorsed other and turned their shields and drew their swords and fought mightily as noble #knight# proved by the space of two hours
so then sir belliance prayed him to tell him his name sir said he my name is sir $lamorak_de_galis$
ah said sir belliance thou art the man in the world that i most hate for i slew my sons for thy sake where i saved thy life and now thou hast slain my brother sir $frol$
alas said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ full well me ought to know you for #ye# are the man that most have done for me
alas how should i be accorded with thee therefore defend thee for thou shalt die there is #none# other remedy and therewithal sir $lamorak_de_galis$ kneeled down and besought him of grace
that shall not need said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ for i will yield me unto you not for fear of you nor for your strength but your goodness maketh me full loath to have ado with you wherefore i require you for god sake and for the honour of knighthood forgive me all that i have offended unto you
arise said sir belliance or else thereas thou kneelest i shall slay thee alas said belliance leave thy kneeling or else i shall slay thee without mercy
and at the last belliance withdrew him aback and set him down softly upon a little hill for he was so faint for bleeding that he might not stand
then they yede again unto battle and either wounded other that all the ground was bloody thereas they fought then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ threw his shield upon his back and asked him what #cheer#
ah $black_knight$ sir belliance said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ thou art a #fool# for an i had had thee at such advantage as thou hast done me i should slay thee but thy gentleness is so good and so large that i must needs forgive thee mine evil will
and then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ kneeled down and unlaced first his umberere and then his own and then either kissed other with weeping tears
then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ led sir belliance to an abbey fast by and there sir $lamorak_de_galis$ would not depart from belliance till he was whole
well said sir belliance ah sir yet shall i show you favour in your mal ease and then they sware together that #none# of them should never fight against other
so sir $lamorak_de_galis$ departed and went to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ here leave we of sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and of sir $tristram_de_liones$
how a young man came into the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and how sir $kay_the_seneschal$ called him in scorn $la_cote_male_taile$
at the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ there came a young man and bigly made and he was richly beseen and he desired to be made $black_knight$ of the $king_arthur_s_court$ but his over garment sat over thwartly howbeit it was rich #cloth# of gold
and here beginneth the history of $la_cote_male_taile$ book ix chapter i what is your name said $king_arthur_s_court$
sir said he my name is $breunor_le_noire$ and within short space #ye# shall know that i am of good kin
it may well be said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ but in mockage #ye# shall be called $la_cote_male_taile$ that is as much to say the evil shapen coat
it is a great #thing# that thou askest said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and for what #cause# wearest thou that rich coat tell me for i can well think for some #cause# it is
sir he answered i had a father a noble $black_knight$ and as he rode a hunting upon a #day# it happed him to lay him down to sleep and there came a $black_knight$ that had been long his #enemy# and when he saw he was fast asleep
he all to hew him and this same coat had my father on the same time and that maketh this coat to sit so evil upon me for the #stroke# be on it as i found it and never shall be amended for me
thus to have my father death in remembrance i wear this coat till i be revenged and because #ye# are called the most noblest $king_arthur_s_court$ of the world
sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and sir $gaheris$ it were well done to make him $black_knight$ for him beseemeth well of person and of #countenance# that he shall prove a good man and a good $black_knight$ and a mighty for sir an #ye# be remembered even such one was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ when he came first into this #court# and full few of us knew from whence he came and now is he proved the man of most worship in the world and all your #court# and all your round table is by sir $launcelot_du_lake$ worshipped and amended more than by any $black_knight$ now living
i come to you that #ye# should make me $black_knight$ that is truth said the $king_arthur_s_court$ and to morrow at your request i shall make him $black_knight$
so on the morrow there was an hart found and thither rode $king_arthur_s_court$ with a company of his #knight# to slay the hart
and this young man that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ named $la_cote_male_taile$ was there left behind with #queen# $dame_guenever$ and by sudden adventure there was an horrible lion kept in a strong tower of stone and it happened that he at that time #brake# loose and came hurling afore the #queen# and her #knight#
and when the #queen# saw the lion she cried and fled and prayed her #knight# to rescue her and there was #none# of them all but twelve that abode and all the other fled
now i see well that all coward #knight# be not dead and therewithal he drew his sword and dressed him afore the lion
and he then smote him in the midst of the #head# such a mighty #stroke# that it clave his #head# in sunder and dashed to the earth
then was it told the #queen# how the young man that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ named by scorn $la_cote_male_taile$ had slain the lion
then said $la_cote_male_taile$ and that lion gaped wide and came upon him ramping to have slain him with that the $king_arthur_s_court$ came home
and when the #queen# told him of that adventure he was well pleased and said upon pain of mine #head# he shall prove a noble man and a faithful $black_knight$ and true of his promise then the $king_arthur_s_court$ forthwithal made him $black_knight$
now sir said this young $black_knight$ i require you and all the #knight# of your #court# that #ye# call me by #none# other name
but $la_cote_male_taile$ in so much as sir $kay_the_seneschal$ hath so named me so will i be called
how a $damosel_of_the_lake$ came into the #court# and desired a $black_knight$ to take on him an enquest which $la_cote_male_taile$ emprised
then that same #day# there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ into the #court# and she brought with her a great black shield with a white hand in the midst holding a sword
i assent me well thereto said the $king_arthur_s_court$ chapter ii other picture was there #none# in that shield when $king_arthur_s_court$ saw her he asked her from whence
sir she said i have ridden long and many a #day# with this shield many #way# and for this #cause# i am come to your #court# there was a good $black_knight$ that ought this shield and this $black_knight$ had undertaken a great deed of #arm# to enchieve it and so it misfortuned him another strong $black_knight$ met with him by sudden adventure and there they fought long and either wounded other passing sore and they were so weary that they left that battle even hand
but he must die and then he commanded me to bear this shield to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ he requiring and praying some good $black_knight$ to take this shield and that he would fulfil the #quest# that he was in
now what say #ye# to this #quest# said $king_arthur_s_court$ is there any of you here that will take upon him to wield this shield
she came and what she would so this $black_knight$ that ought this shield saw #none# other #way# then was there not one that would speak one word
then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ took the shield in his hands sir $black_knight$ said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ what is your name #wit# #ye# well said he my name is sir $kay_the_seneschal$ that wide where is known
sir said that $damosel_of_the_lake$ lay down that shield for #wit# #ye# well it falleth not for you for he must be a better $black_knight$ than #ye# that shall wield this shield
well i took this shield in my hands by your leave for to behold it not to that intent but go
$damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ #wit# #ye# wheresomever thou wilt for i will not go with you then the $damosel_of_the_lake$ stood still a great while and beheld many of those #knight#
then spake the $black_knight$ $la_cote_male_taile$ fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ i will take the shield and that adventure upon me so
i wist i should know whitherward my journey might be for because i was this #day# made $black_knight$ i would take this adventure upon me
well mayest thou be called so said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ the $black_knight$ with the evil shapen coat but an thou be so hardy to take upon thee to bear that shield and to follow me #wit#
what is your name fair young man said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ my name is said he $la_cote_male_taile$ thou well thy skin shall be as well hewn as thy coat
as for that said $la_cote_male_taile$ when i am so hewn i will ask you no salve to heal me withal
and forthwithal there came into the #court# two squires and brought him great horses and his armour and his spears and anon
he was armed and took his leave i would not by my will said the $king_arthur_s_court$ that #ye# took upon you that hard adventure
sir said he this adventure is mine and the first that ever i took upon me and that will i follow whatsomever come of me
then that $damosel_of_the_lake$ departed and $la_cote_male_taile$ fast followed after and within a while he overtook the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and anon
how $la_cote_male_taile$ overthrew sir $dagonet$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ #fool# and of the #rebuke# that he had of the $damosel_of_the_lake$
then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ ordained sir $dagonet$ $king_arthur_s_court$ #fool# to follow after $la_cote_male_taile$ and there sir $kay_the_seneschal$ ordained that sir $dagonet$ was horsed and armed and bade him follow $la_cote_male_taile$ and proffer him to joust and so he did and when he saw $la_cote_male_taile$ he cried and bade him
she missaid him in the foulest manner chapter iii make him ready to joust so sir $la_cote_male_taile$ smote sir $dagonet$ over his horse croup
now art thou shamed in $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# when they send a #fool# to have ado with thee and specially at thy first jousts thus she rode long and chid
and within a while there came sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ the good $black_knight$ and there he jousted with $la_cote_male_taile$ and there sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ smote him so sore that horse and all fell to the earth
then $la_cote_male_taile$ arose up lightly and dressed his shield and drew his sword and would have done battle to the utterance for he was #wood# wroth
then the $damosel_of_the_lake$ mocked $la_cote_male_taile$ and said fie for shame not so said sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ as at this time i will not fight upon foot
ah $damosel_of_the_lake$ he said i pray you of mercy to missay me no more my grief is enough though #ye# give me no more i call myself never the worse $black_knight$ when a mare son faileth me and also i count me never the worse $black_knight$ for a fall of sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$
so thus he rode with her two #day# and by #fortune# there came sir $palomides$ and encountered with him and he in the same wise served him as did $bleoberis_de_ganis$ to forehand
what dost thou here in my fellowship said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant thou canst not sit no $black_knight$ nor withstand him one #buffet# but if it were sir $dagonet$
ah fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ i am not the worse to take a fall of sir $palomides$ and yet great disworship have i #none# for neither $bleoberis_de_ganis$ nor yet $palomides$ would not fight with me on foot
then the $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant rebuked him in the foulest manner and bade him turn again coward as for that said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #wit# thou
well they have disdain and scorn to light off their horses to fight with such a lewd $black_knight$ as thou art
so in the meanwhile there came sir $mordred$ $sir_gawaine$ brother and so he fell in the fellowship with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant
and then they came afore the castle orgulous and there was such a custom that there might no $black_knight$ come by that castle but either he must joust or be #prisoner# or at the least to lose his horse and his harness
and there came out two #knight# against them and sir $mordred$ jousted with the foremost and that $black_knight$ of the castle smote sir $mordred$ down off his horse
and then $la_cote_male_taile$ jousted with that other and either of them smote other down horse and all to the earth
and when they avoided their horses then either of them took other horses and then $la_cote_male_taile$ rode unto that $black_knight$ that smote down sir $mordred$ and jousted with him
and there sir $la_cote_male_taile$ #hurt# and wounded him passing sore and put him from his horse as he had been dead
so he turned unto him that met him afore and he took the flight towards the castle and sir $la_cote_male_taile$ rode after him into the castle orgulous and there $la_cote_male_taile$ slew him
chapter iv how $la_cote_male_taile$ fought against an hundred #knight# and how he escaped by the #mean# of a #lady#
there came an hundred #knight# about him and assailed him and when he saw his horse should be slain he alighted and voided his horse and put the bridle under his feet and so put him out of the gate
and when he had so done he hurled in among them and dressed his back unto a #lady# chamber wall thinking himself that he had liefer die there with worship than to abide the #rebuke# of the $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant
and in the meantime as he stood and fought that #lady# whose was the chamber went out slily at her postern and without the gates she found $la_cote_male_taile$ horse and lightly she gat him by the bridle and tied him to the postern
and then she went unto her chamber slily again for to behold how that one $black_knight$ fought against an hundred #knight#
and when she had beheld him long she went to a window behind his back and said thou $black_knight$ thou fightest wonderly well but for
all that at the last thou must needs die but an thou canst through thy mighty prowess win unto yonder postern for there have i fastened thy horse to abide thee but #wit# thou well thou must think on thy worship and think not to die for thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and mightily
when $la_cote_male_taile$ heard her say so he gripped his sword in his hands and put his shield fair afore him and through the thickest press he thrulled through them
and when he came to the postern he found there ready four #knight# and at two the first #stroke# he slew two of the #knight# and the other fled and so he won his horse and rode from them
and all as it was it was rehearsed in $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# how he slew twelve #knight# within the castle orgulous and so he rode on his #way#
and anon and in the meanwhile the $damosel_of_the_lake$ said to sir $mordred$ i ween my foolish $black_knight$ be either slain or taken #prisoner#
and when he was come unto them he told all how he had sped and escaped in despite of them all
thou liest falsely said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that dare i make good but as a #fool# and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee pass
then were they #ware# where he came riding and some of the best of them will tell no tales that may #ye# prove said $la_cote_male_taile$
with that she sent a courier of hers that rode alway with her for to know the truth of this deed and so he rode thither lightly and asked how and in what manner that $la_cote_male_taile$ was escaped out of the castle
for he hath slain here twelve of our best #knight# and we weened unto this #day# that it had been too much for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or for sir $tristram_de_liones$
then all the #knight# cursed him and said that he was a fiend and no man and in despite of us all he is departed from us and maugre our #head#
with this #answer# the courier departed and came to maledisant his #lady# and told her all how sir $la_cote_male_taile$ had sped at the castle orgulous
by my #head# said sir $mordred$ to the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# are greatly to blame so to #rebuke# him for i warn you
but he shall prove a noble $black_knight$ but as yet he may not yet sit sure on horseback for he that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage and exercise
but when he cometh to the #stroke# of his sword he is then noble and mighty and that saw sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $palomides$ for #wit#
then she smote down her #head# and said little plainly he is a good $black_knight$ and i doubt not #ye# well they are wily men of #arm# and anon
they know when they see a young $black_knight$ by his riding how they are sure to give him a fall from his horse or a great #buffet#
but for the most part they will not light on foot with young #knight# for they are wight and strongly armed
for in likewise sir $launcelot_du_lake$ when he was first made $black_knight$ he was often put to the worse upon horseback but ever upon foot he recovered his renown and slew and defoiled many #knight# of the round table
and therefore the #rebuke# that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ did unto many #knight# causeth them that be men of prowess to beware for often i have seen the old proved #knight# rebuked and slain by them that were but young beginners
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ came to the #court# and heard of $la_cote_male_taile$ and how he followed after him and how $la_cote_male_taile$ was #prisoner#
here leave we off a while of this tale and speak we of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that when he was come to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ then heard he tell of the young $black_knight$ $la_cote_male_taile$ how he slew the lion and how he took upon him the adventure of the black shield the which was named at that time the hardiest adventure of the world
so god me save said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ unto many of his fellows it was shame to all the noble #knight# to suffer such a young $black_knight$ to take such adventure upon him for his destruction for i will that #ye# #wit# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that that $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant hath borne that shield many a #day# for to seek the most proved #knight# and that was she that $breuse_saunce_pite$ took that shield from her and after $tristram_de_liones$ rescued that shield from him and gave it to the $damosel_of_the_lake$ again a little afore that time that sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought with my nephew sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ for a quarrel that was betwixt the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland and him
thus they rode sure talking by the #way# together chapter then many #knight# were sorry that sir $la_cote_male_taile$ was gone forth to that adventure
truly said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i cast me to ride after him and within seven #day# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ overtook $la_cote_male_taile$ and then he saluted him and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant
and when sir $mordred$ saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ then he left their fellowship and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode with them all a #day# and ever that $damosel_of_the_lake$ rebuked $la_cote_male_taile$ and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ answered for him then she left off and rebuked sir $launcelot_du_lake$
so this meantime sir $tristram_de_liones$ sent by a $damosel_of_the_lake$ a letter unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ excusing him of the #wedding# of $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ and said in the letter as he was a true $black_knight$ he had never ado fleshly with $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ and passing courteously and gentily sir $tristram_de_liones$ wrote unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ ever beseeching him to be his good friend and unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ of cornwall and that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ would excuse him if that ever he saw her
and within short time by the grace of god said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that he would speak with $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and with him right hastily
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ departed from the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and from sir $la_cote_male_taile$ for to oversee that letter and to write another letter unto sir $tristram_de_liones$
and in the meanwhile $la_cote_male_taile$ rode with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ until they came to a castle that hight $uther_pendragon$ and there were six #knight# stood afore him and one of them proffered to joust with $la_cote_male_taile$
printed by $william_caxton$ as part of chap iv and there $la_cote_male_taile$ smote him over his horse croup
and then the five #knight# set upon him all at once with their spears and there they smote $la_cote_male_taile$ down horse and man
and then they alighted suddenly and set their hands upon him all at once and took him #prisoner# and so led him unto the castle and kept him as #prisoner#
and on the morn sir $launcelot_du_lake$ arose and delivered the $damosel_of_the_lake$ with letters unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ and then he took his #way# after $la_cote_male_taile$ and by the #way# upon a #bridge# there was a $black_knight$ proffered sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to joust and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote him down and then they fought upon foot a noble battle together and a mighty and at the last sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote him down grovelling upon his hands and his knees
and then that $black_knight$ yielded him and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ received him fair sir said the $black_knight$ i require thee tell me your name for much my heart giveth unto you
nay said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ as at this time i will not tell you my name unless then that #ye# tell me your name
certainly said the $black_knight$ my name is sir nerovens that was made $black_knight$ of my lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ ah nerovens de lile said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i am right glad that #ye# are proved a good $black_knight$
for now #wit# #ye# well my name is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ alas said sir nerovens de lile what have i done
and therewithal flatling he fell to his feet and would have kissed them but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ would not let him and then either made great joy of other
and then sir nerovens told sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that he should not go by the castle of $uther_pendragon$ for there is a lord a mighty $black_knight$ and many #knight# with him and
this night i heard say that they took a $black_knight$ #prisoner# yesterday that rode with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ and they say he is a $black_knight$ of the round table
chapter vi how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ fought with six #knight# and after with sir $brian_de_les_isles$ and how he delivered the #prisoner# ah said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that $black_knight$ is my fellow and
him shall i rescue or else i shall lose my life therefore and therewithal he rode fast till he came before the castle of $uther_pendragon$ and anon therewithal
there came six #knight# and all made them ready to set upon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ at once then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ feutred his spear and smote the foremost that he #brake# his back in sunder and three of them hit and three failed
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ passed through them and lightly he turned in again and smote another $black_knight$ through the breast and throughout the back more than an ell and therewithal his spear #brake#
and at every #stroke# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ bestowed so his #stroke# that at four #stroke# sundry they avoided their saddles passing sore wounded and forthwithal he rode hurling into that castle
and anon the lord of the castle that was that time cleped sir $brian_de_les_isles$ the which was a noble man and a great #enemy# unto $king_arthur_s_court$ within a while he was armed and upon horseback
so then all the remnant of the four #knight# drew their swords and lashed at sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and then they feutred their spears and hurled together so strongly that both their horses rashed to the earth
and then they avoided their saddles and dressed their shields and drew their swords and flang together as #wood# men and there were many #stroke# given in a while
at the last sir $launcelot_du_lake$ gave to sir $brian_de_les_isles$ such a #buffet# that he kneeled upon his knees and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rashed upon him and with great #force# he pulled off his #helm# and when sir $brian_de_les_isles$ saw that he should be slain he yielded him and put him in his mercy and in his grace
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ made him to deliver all his #prisoner# that he had within his castle and therein sir $launcelot_du_lake$ found of $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight# thirty and forty #lady# and so he delivered them and then he rode his #way#
the meanwhile sir nerovens that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had foughten withal afore at the #bridge# he sent a $damosel_of_the_lake$ after sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to #wit# how he sped at the castle of $uther_pendragon$
and then they within the castle marvelled what $black_knight$ he was when sir $brian_de_les_isles$ and his #knight# delivered all those #prisoner#
have #ye# no #marvel# said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for the best $black_knight$ in this world was here and did this journey and #wit# #ye# well she said it was sir $launcelot_du_lake$
then was sir $brian_de_les_isles$ full glad and so was his #lady# and all his #knight# that such a man should win them
and when the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and $la_cote_male_taile$ understood that it was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that had ridden with them in fellowship and that she remembered her how she had rebuked him and called him coward then was she passing heavy
and anon as $la_cote_male_taile$ was delivered he gat his horse and his harness and his $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant chapter vii
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ met with the $damosel_of_the_lake$ named male disant and named her the $damosel_of_the_lake$ bienpensant so then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and within two mile they overtook him and saluted him and thanked him and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ cried sir $launcelot_du_lake$ mercy of her evil deed and saying for now i know the flower of all knighthood is departed even between sir $tristram_de_liones$ and you
for god knoweth said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that i have sought you my lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ long and now i thank god i have met with you and once at camelot i met with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and there he rescued this black shield with the white hand holding a naked sword that sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ had taken from me
sir said she there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ from a $black_knight$ that #ye# fought withal at the #bridge# and she told me your name was sir $launcelot_du_lake$
now fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ who told you my name blame have she then said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but her lord sir nerovens hath told her
but $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ upon this covenant i will ride with you so that #ye# will not #rebuke# this $black_knight$ sir $la_cote_male_taile$ no more for he is a good $black_knight$ and i doubt not he shall prove a noble $black_knight$ and for his sake and pity that he should not be destroyed
i followed him to succour him in this great need ah $o_jesu$ thank you said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ for now i will say unto you and to him both
i rebuked him never for no hate that i hated him but for great love that i had to him
and therefore by my will i would have driven him away for jealousy that i had of his life for it may be no young $black_knight$ deed that shall enchieve this adventure to the end
for ever i supposed that he had been too young and too tender to take upon him these adventures pardieu said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ it is well said and where #ye# are called the $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant
and so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border of the country of surluse and there they found a fair village with a strong #bridge# like a fortress
i will call you the $damosel_of_the_lake$ bienpensant and when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and they were at the #bridge# there stert forth afore them of #gentleman# and yeomen
many that said fair lords #ye# may not pass this #bridge# and this fortress because of that black shield that i see one of you bear and therefore there shall not pass but one of you at once
therefore choose you which of you shall enter within this #bridge# first then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ proffered himself first to enter within this #bridge#
i beseech you let me enter within this fortress and if i may speed well i will send for you and if it happened that i be slain there it goeth
sir said $la_cote_male_taile$ and if so be that i am a #prisoner# taken then may #ye# rescue me
i am loath said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to let you pass this passage sir said $la_cote_male_taile$ i pray you let me put my body in this adventure
so he entered and anon there met with him two brethren the one hight sir plaine de #force# and the other hight sir plaine de amours
and anon they met with sir $la_cote_male_taile$ and first $la_cote_male_taile$ smote down plaine de #force# and after he smote down plaine de amours and then they dressed them to their shields and swords and bade $la_cote_male_taile$ alight and so he did and there was dashing and foining with swords and so they began to assail full hard $la_cote_male_taile$ and many great #wound# they gave him upon his #head# and upon his breast and upon his shoulders
now go your #way# said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and $o_jesu$ be your speed and as he might ever among he gave sad #stroke# again
and then the two brethren traced and traversed for to be of both hands of sir $la_cote_male_taile$ but he by fine #force# and knightly prowess
and then when he felt himself so wounded then he doubled his #stroke# and gave them so many #wound# that he felled them to the earth and would have slain them
and right so sir $la_cote_male_taile$ took the best horse that there was of them three and so rode forth his #way# to the other fortress and #bridge# and there he met with the third brother whose name was sir $plenorius$ a full noble $black_knight$ and there they jousted together and either smote other down horse and man to the earth
and then they avoided their horses and dressed their shields and drew their swords and gave many sad #stroke# and one while the one $black_knight$ was afore on the #bridge# and another while the other
gat them afore him had they not yielded them and thus they fought two hours and more and never rested and ever sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and the $damosel_of_the_lake$ beheld them
now may #ye# see said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that he is a noble $black_knight$ for to consider his first battle and his grievous #wound# and even forthwithal so wounded as he is it is #marvel# that he may endure this long battle with that good $black_knight$
how $la_cote_male_taile$ was taken #prisoner# and after rescued by sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ overcame four brethren
this meanwhile sir $la_cote_male_taile$ sank right down upon the earth what for wounded and what for bled he might not stand
then the other $black_knight$ had pity of him and said fair young $black_knight$ dismay you not for had #ye# been fresh when #ye# met with me as i was
well that i should not have endured so long as #ye# have done and therefore for your noble deeds of #arm# i shall show to you kindness and gentleness in all that i may
alas said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ my $black_knight$ fighteth passing sore and over long chapter viii i wot and forthwithal this noble $black_knight$ sir $plenorius$ took him up in his #arm# and led him into his tower
sir said $la_cote_male_taile$ withdraw you from me and hie you to yonder #bridge# again for there will meet with you another manner $black_knight$ than ever was #i_#
and then he commanded him the wine and made to search him and to stop his bleeding #wound# why said $plenorius$ is there another manner $black_knight$ behind of your fellowship
yea said $la_cote_male_taile$ there is a much better $black_knight$ than i am what is his name said $plenorius$
#ye# shall not know for me said $la_cote_male_taile$ well said the $black_knight$ he shall be encountered withal whatsomever he be
either thou must deliver me the #prisoner# that thou hast led unto thy tower or else come and do battle with me
then $plenorius$ gat his horse and came with a spear in his hand walloping toward sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and then they began to feutre their spears and came together as thunder and smote either other so mightily that their horses fell down under them
and then they avoided their horses and pulled out their swords and like two bulls they lashed together with great #stroke# and foins but ever sir $launcelot_du_lake$ recovered ground upon him and sir $plenorius$ traced to have gone about him
then sir $plenorius$ heard a $black_knight$ call that said sir $plenorius$ where art thou but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ would not suffer that but bare him backer and backer till he came #nigh# his tower gate
i know thee well for a good $black_knight$ but #wit# thou well thy life and death is in my hand and therefore yield thee to me and thy #prisoner#
and then said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ the other answered no word but struck mightily upon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ #helm# that the fire sprang out of his eyes
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ doubled his #stroke# so thick and smote at him so mightily that he made him kneel upon his knees
and therewith sir $launcelot_du_lake$ leapt upon him and pulled him grovelling down then sir $plenorius$ yielded him and his tower and all his #prisoner# at his will
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ received him and took his troth and then he rode to the other #bridge# and there sir $launcelot_du_lake$ jousted with other three of his brethren the one hight pillounes and the other hight pellogris and the third sir pellandris
and first upon horseback sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote them down and afterward he beat them on foot and made them to yield them unto him and then he returned unto sir $plenorius$ and there he found in his prison $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ of scotland and many other #knight# and all they were delivered
and then sir $la_cote_male_taile$ came to sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ would have given him all these fortresses and these #bridge#
nay said $la_cote_male_taile$ i will not have sir $plenorius$ livelihood with that he will grant you my lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to come unto $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and to be his $black_knight$ and all his brethren i will pray you my lord to let him have his livelihood
i will well said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ with this that he will come to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and become his man and his brethren five
and as for you sir $plenorius$ i will undertake said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ at the next feast so there be a place voided
sir said $plenorius$ at the next feast of pentecost i will be at $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# and at that time i will be guided and ruled as $king_arthur_s_court$ and #ye# will have me
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $la_cote_male_taile$ reposed them there unto the time that sir $la_cote_male_taile$ was whole of his #wound# and there they had merry #cheer# and good #rest# and many good games and there were many fair #lady#
how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ made $la_cote_male_taile$ lord of the castle of $uther_pendragon$ and after was made $black_knight$ of the round table
that #ye# shall be $black_knight$ of the round table chapter ix and in the meanwhile came sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir brandiles and anon
and as sir $launcelot_du_lake$ came by the castle of $uther_pendragon$ there he put sir $brian_de_les_isles$ from his #land# for #cause# he would never be withhold with $king_arthur_s_court$ and all that castle of $uther_pendragon$ and all the #land# thereof he gave to sir $la_cote_male_taile$
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sent for nerovens that he made once $black_knight$ and he made him to have all the rule of that castle and of that country under $la_cote_male_taile$ and so they rode to $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# all wholly together
and at pentecost next following there was sir $plenorius$ and sir $la_cote_male_taile$ called otherwise by right sir $breunor_le_noire$ both made #knight# of the table round and great #land# $king_arthur_s_court$ gave them and there $breunor_le_noire$ wedded that $damosel_of_the_lake$ maledisant
and after she was called beauvivante but ever after for the more part he was called $la_cote_male_taile$ and he proved a passing noble $black_knight$ and mighty and many worshipful deeds he did after in his life and sir $plenorius$ proved a noble $black_knight$ and full of prowess and all the #day# of their life for the most part they awaited upon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $plenorius$ brethren were ever #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$
they fellowshipped with them and then within ten #day# then departed those #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# from these fortresses and also as the french book maketh mention sir $la_cote_male_taile$ avenged his father death
chapter how $lady_la_beale_isoud$ sent letters to sir $tristram_de_liones$ by her maid $dame_bragwaine$ and of #diver# adventures of sir $tristram_de_liones$
now leave we here sir $la_cote_male_taile$ and turn we unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that was in brittany
when $lady_la_beale_isoud$ understood that he was wedded she sent to him by her #maiden# $dame_bragwaine$ as piteous letters as could be thought and made and her conclusion was that an it pleased sir $tristram_de_liones$ that he would come to her #court# and bring with him $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ and they should be kept as well as she herself
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ called unto him sir $kehydius$ and asked him whether he would go with him into cornwall secretly he answered him that he was ready at all times
and then he let ordain privily a little vessel and therein they went sir $tristram_de_liones$ $kehydius$ $dame_bragwaine$ and $gouvernail$ sir $tristram_de_liones$ squire
so when they were in the sea a contrarious wind blew them on the coasts of north wales #nigh# the castle perilous
and if so be i come not again by that #day# take the next #way# into cornwall for in this forest are many strange adventures as i have heard say and some of them i cast me to prove or i depart
then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ here shall #ye# abide me these ten #day# and $gouvernail$ my squire with you and when i may i shall hie me after you
and so they rode within that forest a mile and more and at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw afore him a likely $black_knight$ armed sitting by a well and a strong mighty horse passing #nigh# him tied to an oak and a man hoving and riding by him leading an horse laden with spears
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $kehydius$ took their horses and departed from their fellowship and this $black_knight$ that sat at the well seemed by his #countenance# to be passing heavy
#ye# seem to be a $black_knight$ errant by your #arm# and harness and therefore dress you to joust with one of us or with both
therewithal that $black_knight$ made no words but took his shield and buckled it about his #neck# and lightly he took his horse and leapt upon him
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode near him and said fair $black_knight$ why sit #ye# so drooping and then he took a great spear of his squire and departed his #way# a furlong
sir $kehydius$ asked leave of sir $tristram_de_liones$ to joust first do your best said sir $tristram_de_liones$ so they met together and there sir $kehydius$ had a fall and was sore wounded on high above the paps
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ said $black_knight$ that is well jousted now make you ready unto me i am ready said the $black_knight$
and then that $black_knight$ took a greater spear in his hand and encountered with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and there by great #force# that $black_knight$ smote down sir $tristram_de_liones$ from his horse and had a great fall
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ was sore ashamed and lightly he avoided his horse and put his shield afore his shoulder and drew his sword
i will well said the $black_knight$ and so he alighted upon foot and avoided his horse and cast his shield upon his shoulder and drew his sword and there they fought a long battle together full #nigh# two hours
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ said fair $black_knight$ hold thine hand and tell me of whence thou art and what is thy name
as for that said the $black_knight$ i will be avised but an thou wilt tell me thy name peradventure i will tell thee mine
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ required that $black_knight$ of his knighthood to alight upon foot and fight with him chapter xi how sir $tristram_de_liones$ met with sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and how they fought and after accorded never to fight together
now fair $black_knight$ he said my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir said the other $black_knight$ and my name is sir $lamorak_de_galis$
didst me of the sending of the horn unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ #court# to the intent to have slain or dishonoured my #lady# the #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and therefore #wit# thou well said sir $tristram_de_liones$ the one of us shall die or we depart
sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ remember that we were together in the isle of servage and at that time #ye# promised me great friendship
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ would make no longer delays but lashed at sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and thus they fought long till either were weary of other
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ said to sir $lamorak_de_galis$ in all my life met i never with such a $black_knight$ that was so big and well breathed as #ye# be therefore said sir $tristram_de_liones$ it were pity that any of us both should here be mischieved
ah sir $lamorak_de_galis$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ well be we met and bethink thee now of the despite thou sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ for your renown and name i will that #ye# have the worship of this battle and
therefore i will yield me unto you and therewith he took the point of his sword to yield him nay said sir $tristram_de_liones$ #ye# shall not do so
for well i know your proffers and more of your gentleness than for any fear or dread #ye# have of me
and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ proffered him his sword and said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ as an overcome $black_knight$ i yield me unto you as to a man of the most noble prowess that ever i met withal
i require you let us be sworn together that never #none# of us shall after this #day# have ado with other
and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ sware that never #none# of them should fight against other nor for weal nor for woe
nay said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i will do you gentleness chapter xii how sir $palomides$ followed the questing beast and smote down sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ with one spear
and this meanwhile there came sir $palomides$ the good $black_knight$ following the questing beast that had in shape a #head# like a serpent #head# and a body like a leopard buttocks like a lion and footed like an hart and in his body there was such a noise as it had been the noise of thirty couple of #hound# questing and such a noise that beast made wheresomever he went and this beast ever more sir $palomides$ followed for it was called his #quest#
and to brief this matter he smote down sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ both with one spear and so he departed after the beast galtisant that was called the questing beast wherefore these two #knight# were passing wroth that sir $palomides$ would not fight on foot with them
here men may understand that be of worship that he was never formed that all times might stand but sometime he was put to the worse by mal #fortune# and at sometime the worse $black_knight$ put the better $black_knight$ to a #rebuke#
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ gat sir $kehydius$ upon a shield betwixt them both and led him to a forester lodge and there they gave him in charge to keep him well and with him they abode three #day#
and right so as he followed this beast it came by sir $tristram_de_liones$ and soon after came $palomides$ then the two #knight# took their horses and at the cross they departed
i require you if #ye# hap to meet with sir $palomides$ say him that he shall find me at the same well where i met him and there i sir $tristram_de_liones$ shall prove whether he be better $black_knight$ than #i_#
and then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ to sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and so either departed from other a sundry #way# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode #nigh# thereas
was sir $kehydius$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ rode until he came to a #chapel# and there he put his horse unto pasture
that was $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_bagdemagus$ son and he there put his horse to pasture and was not #ware# of sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and then this $black_knight$ sir $meliagaunce$ made his moan of the love that he had to #queen# $dame_guenever$ and there he made a woful #complaint#
all this heard sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and on the morn sir $lamorak_de_galis$ took his horse and rode unto the forest and there he met with two #knight# hoving under the #wood# shaw
and anon there came sir $meliagaunce$ fair #knight# said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ what do #ye# hoving here and watching and if #ye# be #knight# errant that will joust lo i am ready
nay sir $black_knight$ they said not so we abide not here to joust with you but we lie here in await of a $black_knight$ that slew our brother
sir they said it is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that slew our brother and if ever we may meet with him he shall not escape but we shall slay him
what $black_knight$ was that said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ that you would fain meet withal #ye# take upon you a great charge said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ is a noble proved $black_knight$
i will not believe that said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ for i heard never yet of no $black_knight$ the #day# of my life
as for that we doubt not for there nis #none# of us but we are good enough for him but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was too big for him
right so as they stood talking thus sir $lamorak_de_galis$ was #ware# how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ came riding straight toward them then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ saluted him and he him again
chapter xiii how sir $lamorak_de_galis$ met with sir $meliagaunce$ and fought together for the beauty of $dame_guenever$ and then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ asked sir $launcelot_du_lake$ if there were anything that he might do for him in these marches
then either departed from other and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ rode again thereas he left the two #knight# and then he found them hid in the leaved #wood#
nay said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ not at this time i thank you fie on you said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ false cowards pity and shame
it is that any of you should take the high order of knighthood so sir $lamorak_de_galis$ departed from them and within a while he met with sir $meliagaunce$
and then sir $lamorak_de_galis$ asked him why he loved #queen# $dame_guenever$ as he did for i was not far from you when #ye# made your #complaint# by the #chapel#
did #ye# so said sir $meliagaunce$ then will i abide by it i love #queen# $dame_guenever$ what will #ye# with it
as to that said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i say nay thereto for #queen# morgawse of $king_lot_of_orkney$ #mother# to $sir_gawaine$ and his #mother# is the fairest #queen# and #lady# that beareth the life
i will prove and make good that she is the fairest #lady# and most of beauty in the world that is not so said sir $meliagaunce$ and that will i prove with my hands upon thy body
will #ye# so said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and in a better quarrel keep i not to fight then they departed either from other in great wrath
and then they came riding together as it had been thunder and either smote other so sore that their horses fell backward to the earth
and then they avoided their horses and dressed their shields and drew their swords and then they hurtled together as wild boars and thus they fought a great while
for $meliagaunce$ was a good man and of great might but sir $lamorak_de_galis$ was hard big for him and put him always aback but either had wounded other sore
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode betwixt them and asked them for what #cause# they fought so together and #ye# are both #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$
and as they stood thus fighting by #fortune# came sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ riding chapter xiv how sir $meliagaunce$ told for what #cause# they fought and how sir $lamorak_de_galis$ jousted with $king_arthur_s_court$
i praised my #lady# #queen# $dame_guenever$ and said she was the fairest #lady# of the world and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ said nay thereto for he said #queen# morgawse of $king_lot_of_orkney$ was fairer than she and more of beauty
sir said $meliagaunce$ i shall tell you for what #cause# we do this battle ah sir $lamorak_de_galis$ why sayest thou so
and therewith he alighted on foot and said for this quarrel make thee ready for i will prove upon thee that #queen# $dame_guenever$ is the fairest #lady# and most of bounty in the world
sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i am loath to have ado with you in this quarrel for every man thinketh his own #lady# fairest and though i praise the #lady# that i love most #ye# should not be wroth for though my #lady# #queen# $dame_guenever$ be fairest in your eye #wit#
#ye# well #queen# morgawse of $king_lot_of_orkney$ is fairest in mine eye and so every $black_knight$ thinketh his own #lady# fairest and #wit# #ye# well
sir #ye# are the man in the world except sir $tristram_de_liones$ that i am most loathest to have ado withal but an #ye# will needs fight with me
it is not thy part to dispraise thy princess that thou art under her obeissance and we all i shall endure you as long as i may
then spake sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and said my lord sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i wist you never so misadvised as #ye# are now for sir $lamorak_de_galis$ sayeth you but reason and knightly for i warn you
i have a #lady# and methinketh that she is the fairest #lady# of the world were this a great reason that #ye# should be wroth with me for such language
and well #ye# wot that sir $lamorak_de_galis$ is as noble a $black_knight$ as i know and he hath ought you and us ever good will and
therefore i pray you be good friends then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ said unto sir $lamorak_de_galis$ i pray you forgive me mine evil will and if i was misadvised i will amend it
and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ departed and sir $meliagaunce$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ took their horses and either departed from other
and within a while came $king_arthur_s_court$ and met with sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and jousted with him and there he smote down sir $lamorak_de_galis$ and wounded him sore with a spear and so he rode from him wherefore sir $lamorak_de_galis$ was wroth that he would not fight with him on foot howbeit that sir $lamorak_de_galis$ knew not $king_arthur_s_court$
how sir $kay_the_seneschal$ met with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and after of the shame spoken of the #knight# of cornwall and how they jousted
now leave we of this tale and speak we of sir $tristram_de_liones$ that as he rode he met with sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and there sir $kay_the_seneschal$ asked sir $tristram_de_liones$ of what country he was
sir said sir $lamorak_de_galis$ the amends is soon made betwixt you and me chapter xv he answered that he was of the country of cornwall
it may well be said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ for yet heard i never that ever good $black_knight$ came out of cornwall that is evil spoken said sir $tristram_de_liones$ but an it please you to tell me your name i require you
sir #wit# #ye# well said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ that my name is sir $kay_the_seneschal$ is that your name said sir $tristram_de_liones$ now #wit#
#ye# well that #ye# are named the shamefullest $black_knight$ of your tongue that now is living howbeit #ye# are called a good $black_knight$ but #ye# are called unfortunate and passing overthwart of your tongue
would not let them pass till one of them jousted with him and so that $black_knight$ jousted with sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and there that $black_knight$ gave sir $kay_the_seneschal$ a fall his name was sir $tor$ sir $lamorak_de_galis$ half brother
and then they two rode to their lodging and there they found sir brandiles and sir $tor$ came thither anon after
and thus they rode together till they came to a #bridge# and there was a $black_knight$ and as they sat at supper these four #knight# three of them spake all shame by cornish #knight#
sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard all that they said and he said but little but he thought the more but at that time he discovered not his name
and there sir brandiles proffered to joust with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote him down horse and all to the earth
then sir $tor$ le fise de vayshoure encountered with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote him down and then he rode his #way# and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ followed him but he would not of his fellowship
upon the morn sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his horse and abode them upon their #way# then sir brandiles came to sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and said i would #wit# fain what is that $black_knight$ name
so they rode together till they came #nigh# him and then they were #ware# where he sat by a well and had put off his #helm# to drink at the well
and when he saw them come he laced on his #helm# lightly and took his horse and proffered them to joust
come on with me said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and we shall pray him to tell us his name nay said sir brandiles we jousted late enough with you we come not in that intent
my fair #knight# sithen that is your desire and to please you #ye# shall #wit# that my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ nephew unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ of cornwall
but for this we come to require you of knighthood to tell us your name in good time said sir brandiles and well be #ye# found and
#wit# #ye# well that we be right glad that we have found you and we be of a fellowship that would be right glad of your company
for #ye# are the $black_knight$ in the world that the noble fellowship of the round table most desireth to have the company of
god thank them said sir $tristram_de_liones$ of their great goodness but as yet i feel well that i am unable to be of their fellowship for i was never yet of such deeds of worthiness to be in the company of such a fellowship
ah said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ an #ye# be sir $tristram_de_liones$ #ye# are the man called now most of prowess except sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for he beareth not the life christian nor heathen that can find such another $black_knight$ to speak of his prowess and of his hands and his truth withal
for yet could there never creature say of him dishonour and make it good thus they talked a great while and then they departed either from other such #way# as them seemed best
chapter xvi how $king_arthur_s_court$ was brought into the forest perilous and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ saved his life now shall #ye# hear what was the #cause# that $king_arthur_s_court$ came into the forest perilous
her name was annowre and this #lady# came to $king_arthur_s_court$ at cardiff and she by fair promise and fair behests made $king_arthur_s_court$ to ride with her into that forest perilous and she was a great sorceress and many #day# she had loved $king_arthur_s_court$ and because she would have him to lie by her
so when the $king_arthur_s_court$ was gone with her many of his #knight# followed after $king_arthur_s_court$ when they missed him as sir $launcelot_du_lake$ brandiles and many other and when she had brought him to her tower she desired him to lie by her and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ remembered him of his #lady# and would not lie by her for no craft that she could do
then every #day# she would make him ride into that forest with his own #knight# to the intent to have had $king_arthur_s_court$ slain
for when this #lady# annowre saw that she might not have him at her will then she laboured by false #mean# to have destroyed $king_arthur_s_court$ and slain
then the #lady# of the lake that was alway friendly to $king_arthur_s_court$ she understood by her subtle crafts that $king_arthur_s_court$ was like to be destroyed
and therefore this #lady# of the lake that hight nimue came into that forest to seek after sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or sir $tristram_de_liones$ for to #help# $king_arthur_s_court$
that same #day# this #lady# of the lake knew well that $king_arthur_s_court$ should be slain unless that he had #help# of one of these two #knight#
that was in north wales by the #mean# of a #lady# she came into that country foras and thus she rode up and down till she met with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and anon as she saw him
o my lord sir $tristram_de_liones$ she said well be #ye# met and blessed be the time that i have met with you for this same #day# and within these two hours shall be done the foulest deed that ever was done in this #land#
come on with me she said and that in all the haste #ye# may for #ye# shall see the most worshipfullest $black_knight$ of the world hard bestead
she knew him fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ may i amend it then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i am ready to #help# such a noble man
he is neither better nor worse said the #lady# of the lake but the noble $king_arthur_s_court$ himself god defend said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that ever he should be in such distress
then they rode together a great pace until they came to a little turret or castle and underneath that castle they saw a $black_knight$ standing upon foot fighting with two #knight# and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ beheld them and at the last the two #knight# smote down the one $black_knight$ and that one of them unlaced his #helm# to have slain him
and the #lady# annowre gat $king_arthur_s_court$ sword in her hand to have stricken off his #head# and therewithal came sir $tristram_de_liones$ with all his might crying traitress traitress leave that
and anon there sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote the one of the #knight# through the body that he fell dead and then he rashed to the other and smote his back asunder and in the meanwhile the #lady# of the lake cried to $king_arthur_s_court$ let not that false #lady# escape
then $king_arthur_s_court$ overtook her and with the same sword he smote off her #head# and the #lady# of the lake took up her #head# and hung it up by the hair of her saddle bow
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ horsed $king_arthur_s_court$ and rode forth with him but he charged the #lady# of the lake not to discover his name as at that time
when the $king_arthur_s_court$ was horsed he thanked heartily sir $tristram_de_liones$ and desired to #wit# his name but he would not tell him but that he was a poor $black_knight$ adventurous and so he bare $king_arthur_s_court$ fellowship till he met with some of his #knight#
and within a while he met with sir $ector_de_maris$ and he knew not $king_arthur_s_court$ nor sir $tristram_de_liones$ and he desired to joust with one of them
and when he had done so he came again to the $king_arthur_s_court$ and said my lord yonder is one of your #knight# he may bare you fellowship and another #day# that deed that i have done for you
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode unto sir $ector_de_maris$ and smote him from his horse i trust to god #ye# shall understand that i would do you service
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ let me #wit# what #ye# are not at this time said sir $tristram_de_liones$ so he departed and left $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $ector_de_maris$ together
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ came to $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and how $kehydius$ began to love $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and of a letter that $tristram_de_liones$ found
and then at a #day# set sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$ met at the well and then they took $kehydius$ at the forester house and so they rode with him to the ship where they left $dame_bragwaine$ and $gouvernail$ and so they sailed into cornwall all wholly together
and by assent and information of $dame_bragwaine$ when they were landed they rode unto sir $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ a trusty friend of sir $tristram_de_liones$
and so $dame_bragwaine$ and sir $dinas$ rode to the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and told the #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ that sir $tristram_de_liones$ was #nigh# her in that country
then for very pure joy $lady_la_beale_isoud$ swooned and when she might speak she said gentle $black_knight$ $kay_the_seneschal$ #help# that i might speak with him outher my heart will brast
then sir $dinas$ and $dame_bragwaine$ brought sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $kehydius$ privily unto the #court# unto a chamber whereas $lady_la_beale_isoud$ had assigned it and to tell the joys that were betwixt $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ there is no tongue can tell it nor heart think it nor pen write it
chapter #xvii# and as the french book maketh mention at the first time that ever sir $kehydius$ saw $lady_la_beale_isoud$
and at the last as #ye# shall hear or the book be ended sir $kehydius$ died for the love of $lady_la_beale_isoud$
he was so enamoured upon her that for very pure love he might never withdraw it and then privily he wrote unto her letters and ballads of the most goodliest that were used in those #day#
and when $lady_la_beale_isoud$ understood his letters she had pity of his #complaint# and unavised she wrote another letter to comfort him withal
and sir $tristram_de_liones$ was all this while in a turret at the commandment of $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and when she might she came unto sir $tristram_de_liones$
so on a #day# $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ played at the chess under a chamber window and at that time sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $kehydius$ were within the chamber over $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and as it mishapped sir $tristram_de_liones$ found the letter that $kehydius$ sent unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ also he had found the letter that she wrote unto $kehydius$ and at that same time $lady_la_beale_isoud$ was in the same chamber
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ came unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and said madam here is a letter that was sent unto you and here is the letter that #ye# sent unto him that sent you that letter
alas madam the good love that i have loved you and many #land# and riches have i forsaken for your love and now #ye# are a traitress to me the which doth me great pain
i won his #land# howbeit i wedded thy sister $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ for the goodness she did unto me
and yet as i am true $black_knight$ she is a clean #maiden# for me but #wit# thou well sir $kehydius$ for this falsehood and #treason# thou hast done me i will revenge it upon thee
and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ drew out his sword and said sir $kehydius$ keep thee and then $lady_la_beale_isoud$ swooned to the earth
and when sir $kehydius$ saw sir $tristram_de_liones$ come upon him he saw #none# other boot but leapt out at a bay window even over the #head# where sat $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ playing at the chess
but as for thee sir $kehydius$ i brought thee out of brittany into this country and thy father $king_arthur_s_court$ howel and when the $king_arthur_s_court$ saw one come hurling over his #head# he said
my lord the $king_arthur_s_court$ said $kehydius$ it fortuned me that i was asleep in the window above your #head# and as i slept i slumbered and so i fell down
fellow what art thou and what is the #cause# thou leapest out at that window and thus sir $kehydius$ excused him
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed from tintagil and how he sorrowed and was so long in a forest till he was out of his mind
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ dread sore lest he were discovered unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ that he was there wherefore he drew him to the strength of the tower and armed him in such armour as he had for to fight with them that would withstand him
and so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw there was no resistance against him he sent $gouvernail$ for his horse and his spear and knightly he rode forth out of the castle openly that was called the castle of tintagil
and anon sir gingalin put his spear in his #rest# and ran upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ and #brake# his spear and sir $tristram_de_liones$ at that time had but a sword and gave him such a #buffet# upon the #helm# that he fell down from his saddle and his sword slid adown and carved asunder his horse #neck#
chap ter xviii and even at gate he met with gingalin $sir_gawaine$ son and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode his #way# into the forest and all this doing saw $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
and then he sent a squire unto the #hurt# $black_knight$ and commanded him to come to him and so he did
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ wist that it was sir gingalin he welcomed him and gave him an horse and asked him what $black_knight$ it was that had encountered with him
sir said gingalin i wot not what $black_knight$ he was but well i wot that he sigheth and maketh great dole
and when he had met with him he made great #sorrow# insomuch that he fell down off his horse in a swoon and in such #sorrow# he was in three #day# and three nights
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ within a while met with a $black_knight$ of his own that hight sir fergus then at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ sent unto the #court# by sir fergus for to spere what tidings
and so as he rode by the #way# he met with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that came from sir $palomides$ to know and seek how sir $tristram_de_liones$ did
then sir fergus told her how he was almost out of his mind alas said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ where shall i find him
in such a place said sir fergus then sir fergus found #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ sick in her #bed# making the greatest dole that ever any earthly woman made
and when the $damosel_of_the_lake$ found sir $tristram_de_liones$ she made great dole because she might not amend him for the more she made of him the more was his pain
and then was it three #day# or that she could find him and then she brought him meat and drink but he would #none# and then another time sir $tristram_de_liones$ escaped away from the $damosel_of_the_lake$ and it happed him to ride by the same castle where sir $palomides$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ did battle when $lady_la_beale_isoud$ departed them
and there by #fortune# the $damosel_of_the_lake$ met with sir $tristram_de_liones$ again making the greatest dole that ever earthly creature made and she yede to the #lady# of that castle and told her of the misadventure of sir $tristram_de_liones$
and at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his horse and rode away from her alas said the #lady# of that castle where is my lord sir $tristram_de_liones$
in good time said the #lady# is he so #nigh# me he shall have meat and drink of the best and an harp i have of his whereupon he taught me for of goodly harping he beareth the #prize# in the world
right here by your castle said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ so this #lady# and $damosel_of_the_lake$ brought him meat and drink but he ate little thereof
then upon a night he put his horse from him and then he unlaced his armour and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ would go into the wilderness and brast down the trees and boughs and otherwhile when he found the harp that the #lady# sent him then would he harp and play thereupon and weep together
and sometime when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was in the #wood# that the #lady# wist not where he was then would she sit her down and play upon that harp then would sir $tristram_de_liones$ come to that harp and hearken thereto and sometime he would harp himself
thus he there endured a quarter of a year then at the last he ran his #way# and she wist not where he was become
and then was he naked and waxed lean and poor of flesh and so he fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherds and daily they would give him some of their meat and drink
and when he did any shrewd deed they would beat him with rods and so they clipped him with shears and made him like a #fool#
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ soused $dagonet$ in a well and how $palomides$ sent a $damosel_of_the_lake$ to seek $tristram_de_liones$ and how $palomides$ met with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
and upon a #day# $dagonet$ $king_arthur_s_court$ #fool# came into cornwall with two squires with him and as they rode through that forest they came by a fair well where sir $tristram_de_liones$ was wont to be and the weather was hot and they alighted to drink of that well and in the meanwhile their horses #brake# loose
right so sir $tristram_de_liones$ came unto them and first he soused sir $dagonet$ in that well and after his squires and thereat laughed the shepherds and forthwithal he ran after their horses and brought them again one by one and right so wet as they were he made them leap up and ride their #way#
the meanwhile the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that sir $palomides$ sent to seek sir $tristram_de_liones$ she yede unto sir $palomides$ and told him all the mischief that sir $tristram_de_liones$ endured
alas said sir $palomides$ it is great pity that ever so noble a $black_knight$ should be so mischieved for the love of a #lady# but nevertheless i will go and seek him and comfort him an i may
chapter xix thus sir $tristram_de_liones$ endured there an half year naked and would never come in town nor village then a little before that time $lady_la_beale_isoud$ had commanded sir $kehydius$ out of the country of cornwall
so sir $kehydius$ departed with a dolorous heart and by adventure he met with sir $palomides$ and they enfellowshipped together and either complained to other of their hot love that they loved $lady_la_beale_isoud$
now let us said sir $palomides$ seek sir $tristram_de_liones$ that loved her as well as we and let us prove whether we may recover him
so they rode into that forest and three #day# and three nights they would never take their lodging but ever sought sir $tristram_de_liones$
and upon a time by adventure they met with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ that was ridden from his men all alone when they saw him sir $palomides$ knew him but sir $kehydius$ knew him not
ah false $king_arthur_s_court$ said sir $palomides$ it is pity thou hast thy life for thou art a destroyer of all worshipful #knight# and by thy mischief and thy vengeance thou hast destroyed that most noble $black_knight$ sir $tristram_de_liones$
and therefore defend thee said sir $palomides$ for thou shalt die this #day# that were shame said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ for #ye# two are armed and i am unarmed
as for that said sir $palomides$ i shall find a remedy therefore here is a $black_knight$ with me and thou shalt have his harness
nay said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ i will not have ado with you for #cause# have #ye# #none# to me for all the misease that sir $tristram_de_liones$ hath was for a letter that he found for as to me i did to him no displeasure and god knoweth i am full sorry for his disease and malady
so when the $king_arthur_s_court$ had thus excused him they were friends and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ would have had them unto tintagil but sir $palomides$ would not but turned unto the realm of logris and sir $kehydius$ said that he would go into brittany
now turn we unto sir $dagonet$ again that when he and his squires were upon horseback he deemed that the shepherds had sent that #fool# to array them so because that they laughed at them and so they rode unto the keepers of beasts and all to beat them
sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw them beat that were wont to give him meat and drink then he ran thither and gat sir $dagonet$ by the #head# and gave him such a fall to the earth that he bruised him sore so that he lay still
and then he wrast his sword out of his hand and therewith he ran to one of his squires and smote off his #head# and the other fled
and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his #way# with that sword in his hand running as he had been wild #wood# then sir $dagonet$ rode to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and told him how he had sped in that forest
that well in the forest for there is a #fool# naked and that #fool# and i #fool# met together and he had almost slain me
and therefore said sir $dagonet$ beware $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ that thou come not about ah said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ that is sir matto le breune
that fell out of his #wit# because he lost his #lady# for when sir $gaheris$ smote down sir matto and won his #lady# of him never since was he in his mind and that was pity for he was a good $black_knight$
then sir $andred$ that was cousin unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ made a #lady# that was his #paramour# to say and to noise it that she was with sir $tristram_de_liones$ or ever he died
chapter #xx# how it was noised how sir $tristram_de_liones$ was dead and how $lady_la_beale_isoud$ would have slain herself and this tale she brought unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ #court# that she buried him by a well and that
or he died he besought $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ to make his cousin sir $andred$ $king_arthur_s_court$ of the country of $tristram_de_liones$ of the which sir $tristram_de_liones$ was lord of
all this did sir $andred$ because he would have had sir $tristram_de_liones$ #land# and when $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ heard tell that sir $tristram_de_liones$ was dead he wept and made great dole
but when #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ heard of these tidings she made such #sorrow# that she was #nigh# out of her mind and so upon a #day# she thought to slay herself and never to live after sir $tristram_de_liones$ death
and so upon a #day# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ gat a sword privily and bare it to her garden and there she pight the sword through a plum tree up to the hilt so that it stuck fast and it stood breast high
and as she would have run upon the sword and to have slain herself all this espied $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ how she kneeled down and said sweet lord $o_jesu$ have mercy upon me for i may not live after the death of sir $tristram_de_liones$ for he was my first love and he shall be the last
and with these words came $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and took her in his #arm# and then he took up the sword and bare her away with him into a tower and there he made her to be kept and watched her surely and after that she lay long sick #nigh# at the point of death
this meanwhile ran sir $tristram_de_liones$ naked in the forest with the sword in his hand and so he came to an hermitage and there he laid him down and slept and in the meanwhile the hermit stole away his sword and laid meat down by him
and there was a #giant# in that country that hight tauleas and for fear of sir $tristram_de_liones$ more than seven year he durst never much go at large but for the most part he kept him in a sure castle of his own and so this tauleas heard tell that sir $tristram_de_liones$ was dead by the noise of the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
thus was he kept there ten #day# and at the last he departed and came to the herdmen again then this tauleas went daily at large
and so he happed upon a #day# he came to the herdmen wandering and langering and there he set him down to #rest# among them
the meanwhile there came a $black_knight$ of cornwall that led a #lady# with him and his name was sir dinant and when the #giant# saw him he went from the herdmen and hid him under a tree and so the $black_knight$ came to that well and there he alighted to repose him
and as soon as he was from his horse this #giant# tauleas came betwixt this $black_knight$ and his horse and took the horse and leapt upon him
so forthwith he rode unto sir dinant and took him by the collar and pulled him afore him upon his horse and there would have stricken off his #head#
then the herdmen said unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ #help# yonder $black_knight$ #help# #ye# him said sir $tristram_de_liones$ we dare not said the herdmen
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ was #ware# of the sword of the $black_knight$ thereas it lay and so thither he ran and took up the sword and struck off sir tauleas #head# and so he yede his #way# to the herdmen
how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ found sir $tristram_de_liones$ naked and made him to be borne home to tintagil and how he was there known by a brachet
then the $black_knight$ took up the #giant# #head# and bare it with him unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and told him what adventure betid him in the forest and how a naked man rescued him from the grimly #giant# tauleas
forsooth said sir dinant at the fair #fountain# in your forest where many adventurous #knight# meet and there is the mad man
so within a #day# or two $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ commanded his #knight# and his hunters that they should be ready on the morn for to hunt and so upon the morn he went unto that forest
and when the $king_arthur_s_court$ came to that well he found there lying by that well a fair naked man and a sword by him
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ blew and straked and therewith his #knight# came to him and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ commanded his #knight# to
chapter xxi where had #ye# this adventure said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ well said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ i will see that wild man take that naked man with fairness and bring him to my castle
so they did softly and fair and cast #mantle# upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ and so led him unto tintagil and there they bathed him and washed him and gave him hot suppings till they had brought him well to his remembrance but all this
so it fell upon a #day# that the #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ heard of such a man that ran naked in the forest and how the $king_arthur_s_court$ had brought him home to the #court#
then $lady_la_beale_isoud$ called unto her $dame_bragwaine$ and said come on with me for we will go see this man that my lord brought from the forest the last #day#
while there was no creature that knew sir $tristram_de_liones$ nor what man he was so they passed forth and spered where was the sick man
and then a squire told the #queen# that he was in the garden taking his #rest# and reposing him against the sun
so when the #queen# looked upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ she was not remembered of him but ever she said unto $dame_bragwaine$
meseemeth i should have seen him heretofore in many places but as soon as sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw her he knew her well enough
then the #queen# had always a little brachet with her that sir $tristram_de_liones$ gave her the first time that ever she came into cornwall and never would that brachet depart from her
but if sir $tristram_de_liones$ was #nigh# thereas was $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and this brachet was sent from the $king_arthur_s_court$ daughter of france unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ for great love
and anon as this little brachet felt a savour of sir $tristram_de_liones$ she leapt upon him and licked his lears and his ears and then she whined and quested and she smelled at his feet and at his hands and on all parts of his body that she might come to
ah my #lady# said $dame_bragwaine$ unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ alas alas said she i see it is mine own lord sir $tristram_de_liones$
and then he turned away his visage and wept and thereupon $lady_la_beale_isoud$ fell down in a swoon and so lay a great while
and when she might speak she said my lord sir $tristram_de_liones$ blessed be god #ye# have your life and now i am sure #ye# shall be discovered by this little brachet for she will never leave you
and also i am sure as soon as my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ do know you he will banish you out of the country of cornwall or else he will destroy you for god sake mine own lord grant $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ his will and then draw you unto the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ for there are #ye# beloved and ever when i may
i shall send unto you and when #ye# list #ye# may come to me and at all times early and late i will be at your commandment to live as poor a life as ever did #queen# or #lady#
o madam said sir $tristram_de_liones$ go from me for mickle anger and danger have i escaped for your love chapter xxii
then the #queen# departed but the brachet would not from him and therewithal came $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and the brachet set upon him and bayed at them all
how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ by the advice of his council banished sir $tristram_de_liones$ out of cornwall the term of ten years there withal sir $andred$ spake and said sir this is sir $tristram_de_liones$ i see by the brachet
nay said the $king_arthur_s_court$ i cannot suppose that then the $king_arthur_s_court$ asked him upon his faith what he was and what was his name
so god me #help# said he my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ now do by me what #ye# list ah said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ me repenteth of your recovery
and then he let call his barons to judge sir $tristram_de_liones$ to the death then many of his barons would not assent thereto and in especial sir $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir fergus
and so by the advice of them all sir $tristram_de_liones$ was banished out of the country for ten year and thereupon he took his #oath# upon a book before the $king_arthur_s_court$ and his barons
and so he was made to depart out of the country of cornwall and there were many barons brought him unto his ship of the which some were his friends and some his foes
and in the meanwhile there came a $black_knight$ of $king_arthur_s_court$ his name was $dinadan$ and his coming was for to seek after sir $tristram_de_liones$ then they showed him where he was armed at all points going to the ship
now fair $black_knight$ said sir $dinadan$ or #ye# pass this #court# that #ye# will joust with me i require thee with a good will said sir $tristram_de_liones$ an these lords will give me leave
then the barons granted thereto and so they ran together and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ gave sir $dinadan$ a fall and then he prayed sir $tristram_de_liones$ to give him leave to go in his fellowship
and so they took their horses and rode to their ships together and when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was in the sea he said
greet well $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and all mine #enemy# and say them i will come again when i may and well am i rewarded for the fighting with sir $marhaus$ and delivered all this country from servage and well am i rewarded for the fetching and costs of #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ out of ireland and the danger that i was in first and last and by the #way# coming home what danger i had to bring again #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ from the castle pluere and well am i rewarded when i fought with sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ for sir $segwarides$ #wife# and well am i rewarded when i fought with sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ for $king_arthur_s_court$ anguish father unto $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and well am i rewarded when i smote down the good $black_knight$ sir $lamorak_de_galis$ at $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ request and well am i rewarded when i fought with the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis and both these would have put his #land# in servage and by me they were put to a #rebuke# and well am i rewarded for the slaying of tauleas the mighty #giant# and many other deeds
and tell $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ that many noble #knight# of the table round have spared the barons of this country for my sake
also am i not well rewarded when i fought with the good $black_knight$ sir $palomides$ and rescued #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ from him and at that time $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ said afore all his barons i should have been better rewarded
#ye# shall be right welcome said then sir $tristram_de_liones$ have i done for him and now have i my warison and forthwithal he took the sea
chapter xxiii how a $damosel_of_the_lake$ sought #help# to #help# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ against thirty #knight# and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought with them
and at the next landing fast by the sea there met with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and with sir $dinadan$ sir $ector_de_maris$ and sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and there sir $ector_de_maris$ jousted with sir $dinadan$ and he smote him and his horse down
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ would have jousted with sir $bors_de_ganis$ and sir $bors_de_ganis$ said that he would not joust with no cornish #knight# for they are not called men of worship and all this was done upon a #bridge#
and with this came sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir driant and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ proffered to joust with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$
i wist never cornish $black_knight$ of so great valour nor so valiant as that $black_knight$ that beareth the trappings embroidered with crowns
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $dinadan$ departed from them into a forest and there met them a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that came for the love of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to seek after some noble #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #court# for to rescue sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was ordained for by the #treason# of $queen_morgan_le_fay$ to have slain sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and for that #cause# she ordained thirty #knight# to lie in await for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and this $damosel_of_the_lake$ knew this #treason#
then said sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and for this #cause# the $damosel_of_the_lake$ came for to seek noble #knight# to #help# sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and so this $damosel_of_the_lake$ met with sir $bors_de_ganis$ and sir $ector_de_maris$ and with sir driant and there she told them all four of the #treason# of $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and then they promised her that they would be #nigh# where sir $launcelot_du_lake$ should meet with the thirty #knight#
for that night or the #day# after sir $launcelot_du_lake$ should come where these thirty #knight# were and if so be they set upon him we will do rescues as we can
so the $damosel_of_the_lake$ departed and by adventure the $damosel_of_the_lake$ met with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and with sir $dinadan$ and there the $damosel_of_the_lake$ told them all the #treason# that was ordained for sir $launcelot_du_lake$
fair $damosel_of_the_lake$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ bring me to that same place where they should meet with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ then said sir $dinadan$
it is not for us to fight with thirty #knight# and #wit# you well i will not thereof as to match one $black_knight$ two or three is enough an they be men but for to match fifteen #knight# that will i never undertake
what will #ye# do fie for shame said sir $tristram_de_liones$ do but your part nay said sir $dinadan$ i will not thereof
but if #ye# will lend me your shield for #ye# bear a shield of cornwall and for the cowardice that is named to the #knight# of cornwall by your shields
#ye# be ever forborne nay said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will not depart from my shield for her sake that gave it me
but one #thing# said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i promise thee sir $dinadan$ but if thou wilt promise me to abide with me here i shall slay thee for i desire no more of thee but #answer# one $black_knight$
and if thy heart will not serve thee stand by and look upon me and them sir said sir $dinadan$ i promise you to look upon and to do what i may to save myself but
so then anon these thirty #knight# came fast by these four #knight# and they were #ware# of them and either of other
and so these thirty #knight# let them pass for this #cause# that they would not wrath them if case be that they had ado with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and the four #knight# let them pass to this intent that they would see and behold what they would do with sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and so the thirty #knight# passed on and came by sir $tristram_de_liones$ and by sir $dinadan$ and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ cried on high
i would i had not met with you lo here is a $black_knight$ against you for the love of sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and there he slew two with one spear and ten with his sword and then came in sir $dinadan$ and he did passing well and so of the thirty #knight#
all this battle saw sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and his three fellows and then they saw well it was the same $black_knight$ that jousted with them at the #bridge# then they took their horses and rode unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ and praised him and thanked him of his good deeds and they all desired sir $tristram_de_liones$ to go with them to their lodging and he said nay he would not go to no lodging
there went but ten away and they fled then they all four #knight# prayed him to tell them his name fair lords said sir $tristram_de_liones$ as at this time i will not tell you my name
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $dinadan$ rode forth their #way# till they came to the shepherds and to the herdmen and there they asked them if they knew any lodging or harbour there #nigh# hand
forsooth sirs said the herdmen hereby is good lodging in a castle but there is such a custom that there shall no $black_knight$ be harboured
chapter xxiv how sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $dinadan$ came to a lodging where they must joust with two #knight# but if he joust with two #knight# and if he be but one $black_knight$ he must joust with two
and as #ye# be therein soon shall #ye# be matched there is shrewd harbour said sir $dinadan$ lodge where #ye# will for i will not lodge there
fie for shame said sir $tristram_de_liones$ are #ye# not a $black_knight$ of the table round wherefore #ye# may not with your worship refuse your lodging
not so said the herdmen for an #ye# be beaten and have the worse #ye# shall not be lodged there and if #ye# beat them #ye# shall be well harboured
then sir $dinadan$ would not lodge there in no manner but as sir $tristram_de_liones$ required him of his knighthood and so they rode thither
and to make short tale sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $dinadan$ smote them down both and so they entered into the castle and had good #cheer# as they could think or devise
and when they were unarmed and thought to be merry and in good #rest# there came in at the gates sir $palomides$ and sir $gaheris$ requiring to have the custom of the castle
ah said sir $dinadan$ they are two sure #knight# what array is this said sir $dinadan$ i would have my #rest#
that may not be said sir $tristram_de_liones$ now must we needs defend the custom of this castle insomuch as we have the better of the lords of this castle and therefore said sir $tristram_de_liones$ needs must #ye# make you ready
and so they made them ready and sir $gaheris$ encountered with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $gaheris$ had a fall and sir $palomides$ encountered with sir $dinadan$ and sir $dinadan$ had a fall then was it fall for fall
in the devil name said sir $dinadan$ came i into your company so then must they fight on foot that would not sir $dinadan$ for he was so sore bruised of the fall that sir $palomides$ gave him
i will not said sir $dinadan$ for i am sore wounded of the thirty #knight# that we had but late ago to do withal
but #ye# fare said sir $dinadan$ unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ as a madman and as a man that is out of his mind that would cast himself away and i may curse the time that ever i saw you for in all the world are not two such #knight# that be so #wood# as is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and #ye# sir $tristram_de_liones$ for once i fell in the fellowship of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ as i have done now with you and he set me a work that a quarter of a year i kept my #bed#
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ unlaced sir $dinadan$ #helm# and prayed him to #help# him $o_jesu$ defend me said sir $dinadan$ from such two #knight# and specially from your fellowship
then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i will fight with them both then sir $tristram_de_liones$ bade them come forth both for i will fight with you
then sir $palomides$ and sir $gaheris$ dressed them and smote at them both then $dinadan$ smote at sir $gaheris$ a #stroke# or two and turned from him
nay said sir $palomides$ it is too much shame for us two #knight# to fight with one and then he did bid sir $gaheris$ stand aside with that $black_knight$ that hath no list to fight
then they rode together and fought long and at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ doubled his #stroke# and drove sir $palomides$ aback more than three strides
and then by one assent sir $gaheris$ and sir $dinadan$ went betwixt them and departed them in sunder and then by assent of sir $tristram_de_liones$ they would have lodged together
and then he cursed the time that ever he came in their fellowship and so he took his horse and his harness and departed
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ prayed the lords of that castle to lend him a man to bring him to a lodging and so they did and overtook sir $dinadan$ and rode to their lodging two mile thence with a good man in a priory and there they were well at ease
and that same night sir $bors_de_ganis$ and sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $ector_de_maris$ and sir driant abode still in the same place thereas sir $tristram_de_liones$ fought with the thirty #knight# and there they met with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ the same night and had made promise to lodge with sir colgrevance the same night
but sir $dinadan$ would not lodge in that castle chapter xxv how sir $tristram_de_liones$ jousted with sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $sagramore$
but anon as the noble $black_knight$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ heard of the shield of cornwall then wist he well that it was sir $tristram_de_liones$ that fought with his #enemy#
le desirous and how $sir_gawaine$ turned sir $tristram_de_liones$ from $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ praised sir $tristram_de_liones$ and called him the man of most worship in the world
so there was a $black_knight$ in that priory that hight $king_pellinore$ and he desired to #wit# the name of sir $tristram_de_liones$ but in no wise he could not and so sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed and left sir $dinadan$ in the priory for he was so weary and so sore bruised that he might not ride
sithen that #ye# will not tell me that $black_knight$ name i will ride after him and make him to tell me his name or he shall die therefore
then this $black_knight$ sir $king_pellinore$ said to sir $dinadan$ beware sir $black_knight$ said sir $dinadan$ for an #ye# follow him #ye# shall repent it
so that $black_knight$ sir $king_pellinore$ rode after sir $tristram_de_liones$ and required him of jousts then sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote him down and wounded him through the shoulder and so he passed on his #way#
and on the next #day# following sir $tristram_de_liones$ met with pursuivants and they told him that there was made a great cry of #tournament# between $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ of scotland and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of north wales and either should joust against other at the castle of #maiden# and these pursuivants sought all the country after the good #knight# and in especial $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ let make seeking for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis let seek after sir $tristram_de_liones$
and at that time sir $tristram_de_liones$ thought to be at that jousts and so by adventure they met with sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $sagramore$ le desirous and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ required sir $tristram_de_liones$ to joust and sir $tristram_de_liones$ in a manner refused him because he would not be #hurt# nor bruised against the great jousts that should be before the castle of #maiden# and therefore thought to repose him and to #rest# him
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard him say so he turned to him and then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ refused him and turned his back
and alway sir $kay_the_seneschal$ cried sir $black_knight$ of cornwall joust with me or else yield thee to me as recreant then sir $tristram_de_liones$ said as i find thee i shall take thee
then sir $sagramore$ le desirous rode after sir $tristram_de_liones$ and made him to joust with him and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down sir $sagramore$ le desirous from his horse and rode his #way# and the same #day# he met with a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that told him that he should win great worship of a $black_knight$ adventurous that did much harm in all that country
then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ turned with evil will and sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote sir $kay_the_seneschal$ down and so he rode forth when sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard her say so he was glad to go with her to win worship
so sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode with that $damosel_of_the_lake$ a six mile and then met him $sir_gawaine$ and therewithal $sir_gawaine$ knew the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that she was a $damosel_of_the_lake$ of $queen_morgan_le_fay$
then $sir_gawaine$ understood that she led that $black_knight$ to some mischief fair $black_knight$ said $sir_gawaine$ whither ride you now with that $damosel_of_the_lake$
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i wot not whither i shall ride but as the $damosel_of_the_lake$ will lead me sir said $sir_gawaine$ #ye# shall not ride with her for she and her #lady# did never good but ill
$damosel_of_the_lake$ but if thou tell me anon for what #cause# thou leadest this $black_knight$ with thee thou shalt die for it right anon
and then $sir_gawaine$ pulled out his sword and said i know all your #lady# #treason# and yours mercy $sir_gawaine$ she said and if #ye# will save my life i will tell you
sir she said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ my #lady# hath ordained a thirty #lady# to seek and espy after sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or sir $tristram_de_liones$ and by the trains of these #lady# who that may first meet any of these two #knight# they should turn them unto $queen_morgan_le_fay$ castle saying that they should do deeds of worship and if any of the two #knight# came there there be thirty #knight# lying and watching in a tower to wait upon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or upon sir $tristram_de_liones$
fie for shame said $sir_gawaine$ that ever such false #treason# should be wrought or used in a #queen# and a $king_arthur_s_court$ sister and a $king_arthur_s_court$ and #queen# daughter
say on said $sir_gawaine$ and thou shalt have thy life chapter #xxvi# how sir $tristram_de_liones$ and $sir_gawaine$ rode to have foughten with the thirty #knight# but they durst not come out
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ go #ye# to them an it please you and #ye# shall see i will not fail you for it is not long ago since i and a fellow met with thirty #knight# of that #queen# fellowship and god speed us so that we may win worship
so then $sir_gawaine$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode toward the castle where $queen_morgan_le_fay$ was and ever $sir_gawaine$ deemed well that he was sir $tristram_de_liones$ because he heard that two #knight# had slain and beaten thirty #knight#
and when they came afore the castle $sir_gawaine$ spake on high and said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ send out your #knight# that #ye# have laid in a watch for sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and for sir $tristram_de_liones$
now said $sir_gawaine$ i know your false #treason# and through all places where that i ride men shall know of your false #treason# and now let see said $sir_gawaine$ whether #ye# dare come out of your castle #ye# thirty #knight#
sir said $sir_gawaine$ will #ye# stand with me and we will see the malice of these thirty #knight# then the #queen# spake and all the thirty #knight# at once and said $sir_gawaine$ full well wottest thou
what thou dost and sayest for by god we know thee passing well but all that thou speakest and dost thou sayest it upon pride of that good $black_knight$ that is there with thee
for there be some of us that know full well the hands of that $black_knight$ over all well and #wit# thou well
$sir_gawaine$ it is more for his sake than for thine that we will not come out of this castle
for #wit# #ye# well $sir_gawaine$ the $black_knight$ that beareth the #arm# of cornwall we know him and what he is
then $sir_gawaine$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed and rode on their #way# a #day# or two together and there by adventure they met with sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $sagramore$
and then they were glad of $sir_gawaine$ and he of them but they wist not what he was with the shield of cornwall but by deeming
le desirous and thus they rode together a #day# or two and then they were #ware# of sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ chasing a #lady# for to have slain her for he had slain her #paramour# afore
hold you all still said $sir_gawaine$ and show #none# of you forth and #ye# shall see me reward yonder false $black_knight$
and then $sir_gawaine$ rode betwixt sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ and the #lady# and said false $black_knight$ leave her and have ado with me
when sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ saw no more but $sir_gawaine$ he feutred his spear and $sir_gawaine$ against him and there sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ overthrew $sir_gawaine$ and then he rode over him and overthwart him twenty times to have destroyed him and when sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw him do so villainous a deed he hurled out against him
and when sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ saw him with the shield of cornwall he knew him well that it was sir $tristram_de_liones$ and then he fled and sir $tristram_de_liones$ followed after him and sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ was so horsed that he went his #way# quite and sir $tristram_de_liones$ followed him long for he would fain have been avenged upon him
and so when he had long chased him he saw a fair well and thither he rode to repose him and tied his horse till a tree
for an he espy you he is so well horsed that he will escape away chapter xxvii how $damosel_of_the_lake$ $dame_bragwaine$ found $tristram_de_liones$ sleeping by a well and how she delivered letters to him from $lady_la_beale_isoud$
and then he pulled off his #helm# and washed his visage and his hands and so he fell asleep in the meanwhile came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that had sought sir $tristram_de_liones$ many #way# and #day# within this #land#
and when she came to the well she looked upon him and had forgotten him as in remembrance of sir $tristram_de_liones$ but by his horse she knew him that hight passe brewel that had been sir $tristram_de_liones$ horse many years
for when he was mad in the forest sir fergus kept him so this #lady# $dame_bragwaine$ abode still till he was awake
so when she saw him wake she saluted him and he her again for either knew other of old acquaintance then she told him how she had sought him long and broad and there she told him how she had letters from #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ said #lady# $dame_bragwaine$ #ye# shall ride with me till that #tournament# be done at the castle of #maiden# and then shall bear letters and tidings with you
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his horse and sought lodging and there he met with a good ancient $black_knight$ and prayed him to lodge with him
then anon sir $tristram_de_liones$ read them and #wit# #ye# well he was glad for therein was many a piteous #complaint# right so came $gouvernail$ unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that was glad of that #lady#
so this old $black_knight$ name was sir pellounes and he told of the great #tournament# that should be at the castle of #maiden#
and right so there came one unto sir pellounes and told him that sir $persides$ de bloise was come home then that $black_knight$ held up his hands and thanked god of his coming home
and there sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and thirty two #knight# of his blood had ordained shields of cornwall and there sir pellounes told sir $tristram_de_liones$ that in two years he had not seen his son sir $persides$
so on a time sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $persides$ came to their lodging both at once and so they unarmed them and put upon them their clothing
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i know your son well enough for a good $black_knight$ and then these two #knight# each welcomed other
and there i jousted afore $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and so it happed me at that time to overthrow ten #knight# and then came to me sir $tristram_de_liones$ and overthrew me and took my #lady# away from me and that shall i never forget but i shall remember me an ever i see my time
and when sir $persides$ understood that sir $tristram_de_liones$ was of cornwall he said he was once in cornwall ah said sir $tristram_de_liones$ now i understand that #ye# hate sir $tristram_de_liones$
yes said sir $persides$ i know well that sir $tristram_de_liones$ is a noble $black_knight$ and a much better $black_knight$ than i yet
what deem #ye# ween #ye# that sir $tristram_de_liones$ is not able to withstand your malice shall i not owe him my good will
right as they stood thus talking at a bay window of that castle they saw many #knight# riding to and fro toward the #tournament#
and then was sir $tristram_de_liones$ #ware# of a likely $black_knight$ riding upon a great black horse and a black covered shield what $black_knight$ is that said sir $tristram_de_liones$ with the black horse and the black shield
he seemeth a good $black_knight$ i know him well said sir $persides$ he is one of the best #knight# of the world
then is it sir $launcelot_du_lake$ said $tristram_de_liones$ nay said sir $persides$ it is sir $palomides$ that is yet unchristened chapter xxviii
how sir $tristram_de_liones$ had a fall with sir $palomides$ and how $launcelot_du_lake$ overthrew two #knight# then they saw much people of the country salute sir $palomides$
and within a while after there came a squire of the castle that told sir pellounes that was lord of that castle that a $black_knight$ with a black shield had smitten down thirteen #knight#
fair brother said sir $tristram_de_liones$ unto sir $persides$ let us cast upon us cloaks and let us go see the play
not so said sir $persides$ we will not go like knaves thither but we will ride like men and good #knight# to withstand our #enemy#
so they armed them and took their horses and great spears and thither they went thereas many #knight# assayed themself before the #tournament#
and anon sir $palomides$ saw sir $persides$ and then he sent a squire unto him and said go thou to the yonder $black_knight$ with the green shield and therein a lion of gold and say him i require him to joust with me and tell him that my name is sir $palomides$
when sir $persides$ understood that request of sir $palomides$ he made him ready and there anon they met together but sir $persides$ had a fall
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ dressed him to be revenged upon sir $palomides$ and that saw sir $palomides$ that was ready and so was not sir $tristram_de_liones$ and took him at an advantage and smote him over his horse tail when he had no spear in his #rest#
then stert up sir $tristram_de_liones$ and took his horse lightly and was wroth out of measure and sore ashamed of that fall
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ sent unto sir $palomides$ by $gouvernail$ and prayed him to joust with him at his request nay said sir $palomides$ as at this time i will not joust with that $black_knight$
and if he be wroth he may right it to morn at the castle of #maiden# where he may see me and many other #knight#
for i know him better than he weeneth with that came sir $dinadan$ and when he saw sir $tristram_de_liones$ wroth he list not to jape
lo said sir $dinadan$ here may a man prove be a man never so good yet may he have a fall and he was never so wise
but he might be overseen and he rideth well that never fell so sir $tristram_de_liones$ was passing wroth and said to sir $persides$ and to sir $dinadan$ i will revenge me
right so as they stood talking there there came by sir $tristram_de_liones$ a likely $black_knight$ riding passing soberly and heavily with a black shield
what $black_knight$ is that said sir $tristram_de_liones$ unto sir $persides$ i know him well said sir $persides$ for his name is sir briant of north wales
and there came in sir $launcelot_du_lake$ with a shield of the #arm# of cornwall and he sent a squire unto sir briant and required him to joust with him
so he passed on among other #knight# of north wales well said sir briant sithen i am required to joust i will do what i may and there sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote down sir briant from his horse a great fall
whatsoever he be said sir $dinadan$ i warrant you he is of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ blood the which be #knight# of the most noble prowess in the world for to account so many for so many
then there came two #knight# of northgalis that one hight hew de la montaine and the other sir madok de la montaine and they challenged sir $launcelot_du_lake$ foot hot
sir $launcelot_du_lake$ not refusing them but made him ready with one spear he smote them down both over their horses croups and so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode his #way#
by the good lord said sir $tristram_de_liones$ he is a good $black_knight$ that beareth the shield of cornwall and meseemeth he rideth in the best manner that ever i saw $black_knight$ ride
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis rode unto sir $palomides$ and prayed him heartily for his sake to joust with that $black_knight$ that hath done us of northgalis despite
sir said sir $palomides$ i am full loath to have ado with that $black_knight$ and #cause# why is for as to morn the great #tournament# shall be and therefore i will keep myself fresh by my will
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ marvelled what $black_knight$ he was that bare the shield of cornwall nay said the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis i pray you require him of jousts
sir said sir $palomides$ i will joust at your request and require that $black_knight$ to joust with me and often i have seen a man have a fall at his own request
chapter xxix how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ jousted with $palomides$ and overthrew him and after he was assailed with twelve #knight# then sir $palomides$ sent unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ a squire and required him of jousts
fair fellow said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ tell me thy lord name sir said the squire my lord name is sir $palomides$ the good $black_knight$
in good hour said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for there is no $black_knight$ that i saw this seven years that i had liefer ado withal than with him
and so either #knight# made them ready with two great spears nay said sir $dinadan$ #ye# shall see that sir $palomides$ will quit him right well
it may be so said sir $tristram_de_liones$ but i undertake that $black_knight$ with the shield of cornwall shall give him a fall
so they spurred their horses and feutred their spears and either hit other and sir $palomides$ #brake# a spear upon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and he sat and moved not but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smote him so lightly that he made his horse to avoid the saddle and the #stroke# #brake# his shield and the hauberk and had he not fallen he had been slain
how now said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i wist well by the manner of their riding both that sir $palomides$ should have a fall
right so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode his #way# and rode to a well to drink and to repose him and they of northgalis espied him whither he rode and then there followed him twelve #knight# for to have mischieved him for this #cause# that upon the morn at the #tournament# of the castle of #maiden# that he should not win the victory
so they came upon sir $launcelot_du_lake$ suddenly and unnethe he might put upon him his #helm# and take his horse but they were in hands with him and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ gat his spear and rode through them and there he slew a $black_knight$ and #brake# a spear in his body
then he drew his sword and smote upon the right hand and upon the left hand so that within a few #stroke# he had slain other three #knight# and the remnant that abode he wounded them sore all that did abide
thus sir $launcelot_du_lake$ escaped from his #enemy# of north wales and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode his #way# till a friend and lodged him till on the morn for he would not the first #day# have ado in the #tournament# because of his great labour
and on the first #day# he was with $king_arthur_s_court$ thereas he was set on high upon a scaffold to discern who was best worthy of his deeds
i believe it not said sir $dinadan$ right so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ was with $king_arthur_s_court$ and jousted not the first #day#
now turn we unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that commanded $gouvernail$ his servant to ordain him a black shield with #none# other remembrance therein
and so sir $persides$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed from their host sir pellounes and they rode early toward the #tournament# and then they drew them to $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ side of scotland and anon #knight# began the field what of $king_arthur_s_court$ northgalis part and what of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ part and there began great party
chapter xxx how sir $tristram_de_liones$ behaved him the first #day# of the #tournament# and there he had the #prize# then there was hurling and rashing
right so came in sir $persides$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ and so they did fare that they put the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis aback
then came in sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $gaheris$ with them of northgalis and then was sir $persides$ smitten down and almost slain for more than forty horse men went over him
for sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ did great deeds of #arm# and sir $gaheris$ failed him not when sir $tristram_de_liones$ beheld them and saw them do such deeds of #arm# he marvelled what they were
also sir $tristram_de_liones$ thought shame that sir $persides$ was so done to and then he gat a great spear in his hand and then he rode to sir $gaheris$ and smote him down from his horse
and then was sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ wroth and gat a spear and rode against sir $tristram_de_liones$ in great ire and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ met with him and smote sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ from his horse
so then the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# was wroth and he horsed sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $gaheris$ again and there began a great medley and ever sir $tristram_de_liones$ held them passing short and ever sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ was passing busy upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ and there came sir $dinadan$ against sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ gave him such a #buffet# that he swooned in his saddle
then anon sir $dinadan$ came to sir $tristram_de_liones$ and said sir i know thee better than thou weenest but here i promise thee my troth i will never come against thee more for i promise thee that sword of thine shall never come on mine #helm#
with that came sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $tristram_de_liones$ gave him such a #buffet# that down he laid his #head# and then he caught him so sore by the #helm# that he pulled him under his horse feet
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed to his #pavilion# and sir $dinadan$ rode with him and sir $persides$ and $king_arthur_s_court$ then and the #king# upon both parties marvelled what $black_knight$ that was with the black shield
and then $king_arthur_s_court$ blew to lodging many said their advice and some knew him for sir $tristram_de_liones$ and held their #peace# and would nought say
so that first #day# $king_arthur_s_court$ and all the #king# and lords that were judges gave sir $tristram_de_liones$ the #prize# howbeit they knew him not but named him the $black_knight$ with the black shield
then upon the morn sir $palomides$ returned from the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis and rode to $king_arthur_s_court$ side where was $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ kin and $sir_gawaine$ kin
so sir $palomides$ sent the $damosel_of_the_lake$ unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that he sent to seek him when he was out of his mind in the forest and this $damosel_of_the_lake$ asked sir $tristram_de_liones$ what he was and what was his name
as for that said sir $tristram_de_liones$ tell sir $palomides$ #ye# shall not #wit# as at this time unto the time i have broken two spears upon him
but let him #wit# thus much said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that i am the same $black_knight$ that he smote down in over evening at the #tournament# and tell him plainly on what party that sir $palomides$ be i will be of the contrary party
sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ #ye# shall understand that sir $palomides$ will be on $king_arthur_s_court$ side where the most noble #knight# of the world be
in the name of god said sir $tristram_de_liones$ then will i be with the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis because sir $palomides$ will be on $king_arthur_s_court$ side and else i would not but for his sake
so when $king_arthur_s_court$ was come they blew unto the field and then there began a great party and so $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ jousted with the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# and there $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ had a fall
then was there hurling and rushing and right so came in #knight# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and they bare aback the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis #knight#
chapter xxxi how sir $tristram_de_liones$ returned against $king_arthur_s_court$ party because he saw sir $palomides$ on that party the evening afore
de then sir $tristram_de_liones$ came in and began so roughly and so bigly that there was #none# might withstand him and thus sir $tristram_de_liones$ dured long
and at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ fell among the fellowship of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ and there fell upon him sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $ector_de_maris$ and sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and many other #knight#
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote on the right hand and on the left hand that all lords and #lady# spake of his noble deeds
and then he came with his fellowship and rescued sir $tristram_de_liones$ and brought him away from those #knight# that bare the shields of cornwall
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw another fellowship by themself and there were a forty #knight# together and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ was their governor
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode in amongst them and there he smote down sir $kay_the_seneschal$ from his horse and there he fared among those #knight# like a greyhound among conies
but at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ should have had the worse had not the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# been then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ found a $black_knight$ that was sore wounded upon the #head#
sir he said a $black_knight$ that beareth a black shield and i may curse the time that ever i met with him for he is a devil and no man
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ departed from him and thought to meet with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and so he rode with his sword drawn in his hand to seek sir $tristram_de_liones$ and then he espied him how he hurled here and there and at every #stroke# sir $tristram_de_liones$ wellnigh smote down a $black_knight$
o mercy $o_jesu$ said the $king_arthur_s_court$ sith the times i bare #arm# saw i never no $black_knight$ do so marvellous deeds of #arm#
and if i should set upon this $black_knight$ said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to himself i did shame to myself and therewithal sir $launcelot_du_lake$ put up his sword
and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and an hundred more of north wales set upon the twenty of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ kin and they twenty #knight# held them ever together as wild swine and #none# would fail other
and so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ beheld the noblesse or these twenty #knight# he marvelled of their good deeds for he saw by their fare and by their rule that they had liefer die than avoid the field
now $o_jesu$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ well may he be valiant and full of prowess that hath such a sort of noble #knight# unto his kin and full like is he to be a noble man that is their leader and governor
sir said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ who wounded you so sore he meant it by sir $launcelot_du_lake$ so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ had beholden them long he thought shame to see two hundred #knight# battering upon twenty #knight#
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode unto the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and said sir leave your fighting with those twenty #knight# for #ye# win no worship of them #ye# be so many and they so few and #wit# #ye# well they will not out of the field i see by their #cheer# and #countenance# and worship get #ye# #none# an #ye# slay them
therefore leave your fighting with them for i to increase my worship i will ride to the twenty #knight# and #help# them with all my might and power
now i see your courage and courtesy i will withdraw my #knight# for your pleasure for evermore a good $black_knight$ will favour another and like will draw to like
nay said the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# #ye# shall not do so chapter xxxii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ found $palomides$ by a well and brought him with him to his lodging
and all this while and long to #fore# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had watched upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him
and then suddenly sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $dinadan$ and $gouvernail$ his man rode their #way# into the forest that no man perceived where they went
so then $king_arthur_s_court$ blew unto lodging and gave the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis the #prize# because sir $tristram_de_liones$ was upon his side
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode here and there so #wood# as lion that fauted his fill because he had lost sir $tristram_de_liones$ and so he returned unto $king_arthur_s_court$
and then in all the field was a noise that with the wind it might be heard two mile thence how the lords and #lady# cried
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# withdrew his #knight# the $black_knight$ with the black shield hath won the field alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ where is that $black_knight$ become
it is shame to all those in the field so to let him escape away from you but with gentleness and courtesy #ye# might have brought him unto me to the castle of #maiden#
then the noble $king_arthur_s_court$ went unto his #knight# and comforted them in the best wise that he could and said my fair fellows be not dismayed howbeit #ye# have lost the field this #day#
and many were #hurt# and sore wounded and many were whole my fellows said $king_arthur_s_court$ look that #ye# be of good #cheer# for to morn
i will be in the field with you and revenge you of your #enemy# so that night $king_arthur_s_court$ and his #knight# reposed themself
the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that came from $lady_la_beale_isoud$ unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ all the while the #tournament# was a doing she was with #queen# $dame_guenever$ and ever the #queen# asked her for what #cause# she came into that country
madam she answered i come for #none# other #cause# but from my $lady_la_beale_isoud$ to #wit# of your welfare
for in no wise she would not tell the #queen# that she came for sir $tristram_de_liones$ sake so this #lady# $dame_bragwaine$ took her leave of #queen# $dame_guenever$ and she rode after sir $tristram_de_liones$
and as she rode through the forest she heard a great cry then she commanded her squire to go into the forest to #wit# what was that noise
and so he came to a well and there he found a $black_knight$ bounden till a tree crying as he had been #wood# and his horse and his harness standing by him
and when he espied that squire therewith he abraid and #brake# himself loose and took his sword in his hand and ran to have slain the squire
then he took his horse and fled all that ever he might unto $dame_bragwaine$ and told her of his adventure
then she rode unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ #pavilion# and told sir $tristram_de_liones$ what adventure she had found in the forest alas said sir $tristram_de_liones$ upon my #head# there is some good $black_knight$ at mischief
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his horse and his sword and rode thither and there he heard how the $black_knight$ complained unto himself and said i woful $black_knight$ sir $palomides$ what misadventure befalleth me that thus am defoiled with falsehood and #treason# through sir $bors_de_ganis$ and sir $ector_de_maris$
and then he gat his sword in his hands and made many strange signs and tokens and so through his raging he threw his sword into that #fountain#
alas he said why live i so long then sir $palomides$ wailed and wrang his hands and at the last for pure #sorrow# he ran into that #fountain# over his belly and sought after his sword
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw that and ran upon sir $palomides$ and held him in his #arm# fast what art thou said $palomides$ that holdeth me
so i am a man of this forest that would thee #none# harm alas said sir $palomides$ i may never win worship where sir $tristram_de_liones$ is for ever where he is an
then get i no worship and if he be away for the most part i have the gree unless that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ be there or sir $lamorak_de_galis$
then sir $palomides$ said once in ireland sir $tristram_de_liones$ put me to the worse and another time in cornwall and in other places in this #land#
i would fight with him said sir $palomides$ and ease my heart upon him and yet to say thee sooth sir $tristram_de_liones$ is the gentlest $black_knight$ in this world living
i be there what would #ye# do said sir $tristram_de_liones$ an #ye# had sir $tristram_de_liones$ what will #ye# do said sir $tristram_de_liones$ will #ye# go with me to your lodging
nay said he i will go to the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# for he rescued me from sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $ector_de_maris$ and else had i been slain traitorly
sir $tristram_de_liones$ said him such kind words that sir $palomides$ went with him to his lodging then $gouvernail$ went to #fore# and charged $dame_bragwaine$ to go out of the #way# to her lodging and bid
and so they rode together till they came to sir $tristram_de_liones$ #pavilion# and there sir $palomides$ had all the #cheer# that might be had all that night
but in no wise sir $palomides$ might not know what was sir $tristram_de_liones$ and so after supper they yede to #rest# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ for great travail slept till it was #day#
and sir $palomides$ might not sleep for anguish and in the dawning of the #day# he took his horse privily and rode his #way# unto sir $gaheris$ and unto sir $sagramore$ le desirous where they were in their #pavilion# for they three were fellows at the beginning of the #tournament#
#ye# sir $persides$ that he make him no quarrels and then upon the morn the $king_arthur_s_court$ blew unto the #tournament# upon the third #day#
so the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis and the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# they two encountered with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and with the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland and there the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# smote down $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_carados$ and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis smote down the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland
chapter xxxiii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down sir $palomides$ and how he jousted with $king_arthur_s_court$ and other #feat# with that came in sir $palomides$ and when he came he made great work for by his indented shield
so came in $king_arthur_s_court$ and did great deeds of #arm# together and put the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis and the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# to the worse
with this came in sir $tristram_de_liones$ with his black shield and anon he jousted with sir $palomides$ and there by fine #force# sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote sir $palomides$ over his horse croup
he was well known then $king_arthur_s_court$ cried $black_knight$ with the black shield make thee ready to me and in the same wise sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote $king_arthur_s_court$
then $king_arthur_s_court$ with a great eager heart he gat a spear in his hand and there upon the one side he smote sir $tristram_de_liones$ over his horse
and then by #force# of $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight# the $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $palomides$ were horsed again then foot hot sir $palomides$ came upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ as he was upon foot to have overridden him
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ was #ware# of him and there he stooped aside and with great ire he gat him by the #arm# and pulled him down from his horse
then sir $palomides$ lightly arose and then they dashed together mightily with their swords and many #king# #queen# and lords stood and beheld them
and at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote sir $palomides$ upon the #helm# three mighty #stroke# and at every #stroke# that he gave him
he said this for sir $tristram_de_liones$ sake with that sir $palomides$ fell to the earth grovelling then came the $king_arthur_s_court$ with the hundred #knight# and brought sir $tristram_de_liones$ an horse and so was he horsed again
by then was sir $palomides$ horsed and with great ire he jousted upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ with his spear as it was in the #rest# and gave him a great dash with his sword
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ avoided his spear and gat him by the #neck# with his both hands and pulled him clean out of his saddle and so he bare him
afore him the length of ten spears and then in the presence of them all he let him fall at his adventure
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ was #ware# of $king_arthur_s_court$ with a naked sword in his hand and with his spear sir $tristram_de_liones$ ran upon $king_arthur_s_court$ and then $king_arthur_s_court$ boldly abode him and with his sword he smote a two his spear and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ stonied and so $king_arthur_s_court$ gave him three or four #stroke# or he might get out his sword and at the last sir $tristram_de_liones$ drew his sword and either assailed other passing hard
with that the great press departed them then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode here and there and did his great pain that eleven of the good #knight# of the blood of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_ban$ that was of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ kin that #day# sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down that all the estates marvelled of his great deeds and all cried upon the $black_knight$ with the black shield
chapter xxxiv how sir $launcelot_du_lake$ #hurt# sir $tristram_de_liones$ and how after sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down sir $palomides$ then this cry was so large that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ heard it
and then he gat a great spear in his hand and came towards the cry then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ cried the $black_knight$ with the black shield make thee ready to joust with me
when sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard him say so he gat his spear in his hand and either abashed down their #head# and came together as thunder and sir $tristram_de_liones$ spear #brake# in pieces and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ by malfortune struck sir $tristram_de_liones$ on the side a deep #wound# #nigh# to the death but yet sir $tristram_de_liones$ avoided not his saddle and so the spear #brake#
therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ that was wounded gat out his sword and he rushed to sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and gave him three great #stroke# upon the #helm# that the fire sprang thereout and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ abashed his #head# lowly toward his saddle bow
and therewithal sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed from the field for he felt him so wounded that he weened he should have died and sir $dinadan$ espied him and followed him into the forest
so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was departed by the forest side he alighted and unlaced his harness and freshed his #wound# then weened sir $dinadan$ that he should have died
nay nay said sir $tristram_de_liones$ $dinadan$ never dread thee for i am heart whole and of this #wound# i shall soon be whole by the mercy of god
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ abode and did many marvellous deeds by that sir $dinadan$ was #ware# where came $palomides$ riding straight upon them
and so sir $dinadan$ gave him warning and said sir $tristram_de_liones$ my lord #ye# are so sore wounded that #ye# may not have ado with him therefore i will ride against him and do to him what i may and if i be slain #ye# may pray for my #soul# and in the meanwhile #ye# may withdraw you and go into the castle or in the forest that he shall not meet with you
sir $tristram_de_liones$ smiled and said i thank you sir $dinadan$ of your good will but #ye# shall #wit# that i am able to handle him
and then anon hastily he armed him and took his horse and a great spear in his hand and said to sir $dinadan$ adieu and rode toward sir $palomides$ a soft pace
then when sir $palomides$ saw that he made #countenance# to amend his horse but he did it for this #cause# for he abode sir $gaheris$ that came after him
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ was #ware# that sir $palomides$ came to have destroyed him and when he was come he rode toward sir $tristram_de_liones$
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ sent unto sir $palomides$ and required him to joust with him and if he smote down sir $palomides$ he would do no more to him and if it so happened that sir $palomides$ smote down sir $tristram_de_liones$ he bade him do his utterance
then they met together and sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down sir $palomides$ that he had a grievous fall so that he lay still as he had been dead
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ ran upon sir $gaheris$ and he would not have jousted but whether he would or not sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote him over his horse croup that he lay still as though he had been dead
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ rode his #way# and left sir $persides$ squire within the #pavilion# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $dinadan$ rode to an old $black_knight$ place to lodge them
so they were accorded and that old $black_knight$ had five sons at the #tournament# for whom he prayed god heartily for their coming home
and when sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed into the forest sir $launcelot_du_lake$ held alway the stour like hard as a man araged that took no heed to himself and #wit#
and so as the french book saith they came home all five well beaten #ye# well there was many a noble $black_knight$ against him
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ do so marvellous deeds of #arm# he then armed him and took his horse and his armour and rode into the field to #help# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and so many #knight# came in with $king_arthur_s_court$
and to make short tale in conclusion the $king_arthur_s_court$ of northgalis and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of the hundred #knight# were put to the worse and because sir $launcelot_du_lake$ abode and was the last in the field the #prize# was given him
but sir $launcelot_du_lake$ would neither for $king_arthur_s_court$ #queen# nor $black_knight$ have the #prize# but where the cry was cried through the field sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ hath won the field this #day# sir $launcelot_du_lake$ let make another cry contrary sir $tristram_de_liones$ hath won the field for he began first and last he hath endured and so hath he done the first #day# the second and the third #day#
chapter xxxv how the #prize# of the third #day# was given to sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ gave it to sir $tristram_de_liones$
then all the estates and degrees high and low said of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ great worship for the honour that he did unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ and for that honour doing to sir $tristram_de_liones$ he was at that time more praised and renowned than an he had overthrown five hundred #knight# and all the people wholly for this gentleness first the estates both high and low and after the commonalty cried at once sir $launcelot_du_lake$ hath won the field whosoever say nay
then was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ wroth and ashamed and so therewithal he rode to $king_arthur_s_court$ alas said the $king_arthur_s_court$ we are all dismayed that sir $tristram_de_liones$ is thus departed from us
by god said $king_arthur_s_court$ he is one of the noblest #knight# that ever i saw hold spear or sword in hand and the most courteoust $black_knight$ in his fighting for full hard i saw him said $king_arthur_s_court$ when he smote sir $palomides$ upon the #helm# thrice that he abashed his #helm# with his #stroke# and also he said here is a #stroke# for sir $tristram_de_liones$ and thus thrice he said
then $king_arthur_s_court$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir dodinas le $balin_le_savage$ took their horses to seek sir $tristram_de_liones$ and by the #mean# of sir $persides$ he had told $king_arthur_s_court$ where sir $tristram_de_liones$ was in his #pavilion#
then $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ were heavy and returned again to the castle of #maiden# making great dole for the #hurt# of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and his sudden #departing#
so god me #help# said $king_arthur_s_court$ i am more heavy that i cannot meet with him than for all the #hurt# that all my #knight# have had at the #tournament#
right so came sir $gaheris$ and told $king_arthur_s_court$ how sir $tristram_de_liones$ had smitten down sir $palomides$ and it was at sir $palomides$ own request
alas said $king_arthur_s_court$ that was great dishonour to sir $palomides$ inasmuch as sir $tristram_de_liones$ was sore wounded and now may we all #king# and #knight# and men of worship say that sir $tristram_de_liones$ may be called a noble $black_knight$ and one of the best #knight# that ever i saw the #day# of my life
for i will that #ye# all #king# and #knight# know said $king_arthur_s_court$ that i never saw $black_knight$ do so marvellously as he hath done these three #day# for he was the first that began and that longest held on save this last #day#
and though he was #hurt# it was a manly adventure of two noble #knight# and when two noble men encounter needs must the one have the worse like as god will suffer at that time
as for me said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ for all the #land# that ever my father left me i would not have #hurt# sir $tristram_de_liones$ an
but when they came there sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $dinadan$ were gone i had known him at that time that i #hurt# him was for i saw not his shield
for an i had seen his black shield i would not have meddled with him for many #cause# for late he did as much for me as ever did $black_knight$ and that is well known that he had ado with thirty #knight# and no #help# save sir $dinadan$
and one #thing# shall i promise said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir $palomides$ shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow that noble $black_knight$ that i by mishap hurted thus
sir $launcelot_du_lake$ said all the worship that might be said by sir $tristram_de_liones$ then $king_arthur_s_court$ made a great feast to all that would come
and thus we let pass $king_arthur_s_court$ and a little we will turn unto sir $palomides$ that after he had a fall of sir $tristram_de_liones$ he was #nigh# hand araged out of his #wit# for despite of sir $tristram_de_liones$
and as he came by a river in his woodness he would have made his horse to have leapt over and the horse failed footing and fell in the river wherefore sir $palomides$ was adread lest he should have been drowned and then he avoided his horse and swam to the #land# and let his horse go down by adventure
how $palomides$ came to the castle where sir $tristram_de_liones$ was and of the #quest# that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and ten #knight# made for sir $tristram_de_liones$
and when he came to the #land# he took off his harness and sat roaring and crying as a man out of his mind
right so came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ even by sir $palomides$ that was sent from $sir_gawaine$ and his brother unto sir $mordred$ that lay sick in the same place with that old $black_knight$ where sir $tristram_de_liones$ was
for as the french book saith sir $persides$ #hurt# so sir $mordred$ a ten #day# afore and had it hot been for the love of $sir_gawaine$ and his brother sir $persides$ had slain sir $mordred$
and so this $damosel_of_the_lake$ came by sir $palomides$ and she and he had language together the which pleased neither of them and so the $damosel_of_the_lake$ rode her #way# till she came to the old $black_knight$ place and there she told that old $black_knight$ how she met with the woodest $black_knight$ by adventure that ever she met withal
and so he followed him by adventure chapter xxxvi what bare he in his shield said sir $tristram_de_liones$ it was indented with white and black said the $damosel_of_the_lake$
ah said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that was sir $palomides$ the good $black_knight$ for well i know him said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for one of the best #knight# living in this realm
then that old $black_knight$ took a little hackney and rode for sir $palomides$ and brought him unto his own manor and full well knew sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $palomides$ but he said but little for at that time sir $tristram_de_liones$ was walking upon his feet and well amended of his #hurt# and always when sir $palomides$ saw sir $tristram_de_liones$ he would behold him full marvellously and ever him seemed that he had seen him
then would he say unto sir $dinadan$ an ever i may meet with sir $tristram_de_liones$ he shall not escape mine hands
i #marvel# said sir $dinadan$ that #ye# boast behind sir $tristram_de_liones$ for it is but late that he was in your hands and #ye# in his hands why would #ye# not hold him when #ye# had him
for i saw myself twice or thrice that #ye# gat but little worship of sir $tristram_de_liones$ then was sir $palomides$ ashamed
now shall we speak of $king_arthur_s_court$ that said to sir $launcelot_du_lake$ had not #ye# been we had not lost sir $tristram_de_liones$ for he was here daily unto the time #ye# met with him and in an evil time said $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# encountered with him
my lord $king_arthur_s_court$ said $launcelot_du_lake$ #ye# put upon me that i should be #cause# of his departition god knoweth it was against my will
so leave we them a little while in the old castle with the old $black_knight$ sir $darras$ but when men be hot in deeds of #arm# oft they #hurt# their friends as well as their foes
and my lord said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ #ye# shall understand that sir $tristram_de_liones$ is a man that i am loath to offend for he hath done for me more than ever i did for him as yet
but then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ made bring forth a book and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ said here we are ten #knight# that will swear upon a book never to #rest# one night where we #rest# another this twelvemonth until that we find sir $tristram_de_liones$
and as for me said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i promise you upon this book that an i may meet with him either with fairness or foulness i shall bring him to this #court# or else i shall die therefore
and the names of these ten #knight# that had undertaken this #quest# were these following first was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir $ector_de_maris$ sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and $lucan$ the butler sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ sir galihud $lionel$ and galiodin
so these ten noble #knight# departed from the #court# of $king_arthur_s_court$ and so they rode upon their #quest# together until they came to a cross where departed four #way# and there departed the fellowship in four to seek sir $tristram_de_liones$
and as sir $launcelot_du_lake$ rode by adventure he met with $dame_bragwaine$ that was sent into that country to seek sir $tristram_de_liones$ and she fled as fast as her palfrey might go
so sir $launcelot_du_lake$ met with her and asked her why she fled ah fair $black_knight$ said $dame_bragwaine$ i flee for dread of my life for here followeth me
then when sir $launcelot_du_lake$ saw sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ sir $launcelot_du_lake$ cried unto him and said false $black_knight$ destroyer of #lady# and damosels now thy last #day# be come
when sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ saw sir $launcelot_du_lake$ shield he knew it well for at that time he bare not the #arm# of cornwall but he bare his own shield
sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ to slay me hold you #nigh# me said sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and then sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ fled and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ followed after him
but sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ was so well horsed that when him list to flee he might well flee and also abide when him list
and then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ returned unto $dame_bragwaine$ and she thanked him of his great labour chapter xxxvii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $palomides$ and sir $dinadan$ were taken and put in prison
now will we speak of sir $lucan$ the butler that by #fortune# he came riding to the same place thereas was sir $tristram_de_liones$ and in he came in #none# other intent but to ask harbour
then the porter asked what was his name tell your lord that my name is sir $lucan$ the butler a $black_knight$ of the round table
nay nay said sir daname that was nephew to sir $darras$ say him that he shall not be lodged here but let him #wit# that i sir daname will meet with him anon and bid him make him ready
so sir daname came forth on horseback and there they met together with spears and sir $lucan$ smote down sir daname over his horse croup and then he fled into that place and sir $lucan$ rode after him and asked after him many times
so the porter went unto sir $darras$ lord of the place and told him who was there to ask harbour then sir $dinadan$ said to sir $tristram_de_liones$ it is shame to see the lord cousin of this place defoiled
and in the meanwhile sir $dinadan$ was on horseback and he jousted with $lucan$ the butler and there sir $lucan$ smote $dinadan$ through the thick of the thigh and so he rode his #way# and sir $tristram_de_liones$ was wroth that sir $dinadan$ was #hurt# and followed after and thought to avenge him and within a while he overtook sir $lucan$ and bade him turn and so they met together so that sir $tristram_de_liones$ #hurt# sir $lucan$ passing sore and gave him a fall
with that came sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ a gentle $black_knight$ and when he saw sir $lucan$ so #hurt# he called sir $tristram_de_liones$ to joust with him
abide said sir $tristram_de_liones$ and i shall redress it fair $black_knight$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ tell me your name i require you
sir $black_knight$ #wit# #ye# well my name is sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ le fise de roy ureine ah said sir $tristram_de_liones$ by my will
i would not have ado with you at no time #ye# shall not so said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ but #ye# shall have ado with me
and then sir $tristram_de_liones$ saw #none# other bote but rode against him and overthrew sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and #hurt# him in the side and so he departed unto his lodging again
and when sir $dinadan$ understood that sir $tristram_de_liones$ had #hurt# sir $lucan$ he would have ridden after sir $lucan$ for to have slain him but sir $tristram_de_liones$ would not suffer him
then sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ let ordain an horse litter and brought sir $lucan$ to the abbey of $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and the castle thereby hight the castle of $bleoberis_de_ganis$ of the which
sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ was lord and at that castle sir $launcelot_du_lake$ promised all his fellows to meet in the #quest# of sir $tristram_de_liones$
so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was come to his lodging there came a $damosel_of_the_lake$ that told sir $darras$ that three of his sons were slain at that #tournament# and two grievously wounded that they were never like to #help# themself
and all this was done by a noble $black_knight$ that bare the black shield and that was he that bare the #prize#
then came there one and told sir $darras$ that the same $black_knight$ was within him that bare the black shield then sir $darras$ yede unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ chamber and there he found his shield and showed it to the $damosel_of_the_lake$
then without any tarrying sir $darras$ put sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $palomides$ and sir $dinadan$ within a strong prison and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ was like to have died of great sickness and every #day# sir $palomides$ would reprove sir $tristram_de_liones$ of old hate betwixt them
ah sir said the $damosel_of_the_lake$ that same is he that slew your three sons and ever sir $tristram_de_liones$ spake fair and said little
but when sir $palomides$ saw the falling of sickness of sir $tristram_de_liones$ then was he heavy for him and comforted him in all the best wise he could
and as the french book saith there came forty #knight# to sir $darras$ that were of his own kin and they would have slain sir $tristram_de_liones$ and his two fellows but sir $darras$ would not suffer that but kept them in prison and meat and drink they had
so sir $tristram_de_liones$ endured there great pain for sickness had undertaken him and that is the greatest pain a #prisoner# may have
for all the while a #prisoner# may have his health of body he may endure under the mercy of god and in hope of good deliverance but when sickness toucheth a #prisoner# body then may a #prisoner# say all wealth is him bereft and then he hath #cause# to wail and to weep
right so did sir $tristram_de_liones$ when sickness had undertaken him for then he took such #sorrow# that he had almost slain himself
chapter xxxviii how $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ was sorry for the good renown of sir $tristram_de_liones$ some of $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight# jousted with #knight# of cornwall
now will we speak and leave sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $palomides$ and sir $dinadan$ in prison and speak we of other #knight# that sought after sir $tristram_de_liones$
and some yede into cornwall and by adventure sir $gaheris$ nephew unto $king_arthur_s_court$ came unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and there he was well received and sat at $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ own table and ate of his own mess
many #diver# parts of this #land# then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ asked sir $gaheris$ what tidings there were in the realm of logris
sir said sir $gaheris$ the $king_arthur_s_court$ reigneth as a noble $black_knight$ and now but late there was a great jousts and #tournament#
but there was one $black_knight$ that did marvellously three #day# and he bare a black shield and of all #knight# that ever i saw he proved the best $black_knight$
as ever i saw any in the realm of logris and the most noble #knight# were at that jousts then said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ that was sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or sir $palomides$ the paynim
not so said sir gheris for both sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and sir $palomides$ were on the contrary party against the $black_knight$ with the black shield
and therewithal the $king_arthur_s_court$ smote down his #head# and in his heart he feared sore that sir $tristram_de_liones$ should get him such worship in the realm of logris wherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand him
thus sir $gaheris$ had great #cheer# with $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and with #queen# $lady_la_beale_isoud$ the which was glad of sir $gaheris$ words for well she wist by his deeds and manners that it was sir $tristram_de_liones$
and then the $king_arthur_s_court$ made a feast royal and to that feast came sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ le fise de roy ureine and some called him $uwaine_les_avoutres$ le blanchemains
then was it sir $tristram_de_liones$ said the $king_arthur_s_court$ yea said sir $gaheris$ and this sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ challenged all the #knight# of cornwall
then was the $king_arthur_s_court$ #wood# wroth that he had no #knight# to #answer# him then sir $andred$ nephew unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ leapt up and said i will encounter with sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$
then he yede and armed him and horsed him in the best manner and there sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ met with sir $andred$ and smote him down that he swooned on the earth
then was $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ sorry and wroth out of measure that he had no $black_knight$ to revenge his nephew sir $andred$
so the $king_arthur_s_court$ called unto him sir $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ and prayed him for his sake to take upon him to joust with sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$
sir said sir $dinas$ i am full loath to have ado with any $black_knight$ of the round table yet said the $king_arthur_s_court$ for my love take upon thee to joust
so sir $dinas$ made him ready and anon they encountered together with great spears but sir $dinas$ was overthrown horse and man a great fall
who was wroth but $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ alas he said have i no $black_knight$ that will encounter with yonder $black_knight$ sir said sir $gaheris$ for your sake i will joust
so sir $gaheris$ made him ready and when he was armed he rode into the field and when sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ saw sir $gaheris$ shield he rode to him and said
for sir the first time #ye# were made $black_knight$ of the round table #ye# sware that #ye# should not have ado with your fellowship wittingly
and pardie sir $gaheris$ #ye# knew me well enough by my shield and so do i know you by your shield and though #ye# would break your #oath# i would not break mine for there is not one here nor #ye# that shall think i am afeard of you
sir #ye# do not your part but i durst right well have ado with you and yet we be sisters sons
then was sir $gaheris$ ashamed and so therewithal every $black_knight$ went their #way# and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ rode into the country then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ armed him and took his horse and his spear with a squire with him
and then he rode afore sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and suddenly at a gap he ran upon him as he that was not #ware# of him and there he smote him almost through the body and there left him
i wot not said sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ why nor wherefore but by #treason# i am sure i gat this #hurt# for here came a $black_knight$ suddenly upon me or that i was #ware# and suddenly #hurt# me
so within a while there came sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and found sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ and asked him how he was #hurt# then there was come sir $andred$ to seek $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
thou traitor $black_knight$ said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ an i wist it were thou that thus traitorly hast #hurt# this noble $black_knight$ thou shouldst never pass my hands
sir said sir $andred$ i did never #hurt# him and that i will report me to himself fie on you false $black_knight$ said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ for #ye# of cornwall are nought worth
and then sir $gaheris$ took his leave of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ but or he departed he said sir $king_arthur_s_court$ #ye# did a foul shame unto you and your #court# when #ye# banished sir $tristram_de_liones$ out of this country for #ye# needed not to have doubted no $black_knight$ an he had been here
so sir $kay_the_seneschal$ made carry sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ to the abbey of the black cross and there he was healed and so he departed
chapter xxxix of the #treason# of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and how sir $gaheris$ smote him down and $andred$ his cousin then there came sir $kay_the_seneschal$ unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and there he had good #cheer# showing outward
now fair lords said he will #ye# prove any adventure in the forest of morris in the which i know well is as hard an adventure as i know any
and sir $gaheris$ said he would be avised for $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ was ever full of #treason# and therewithal sir $gaheris$ departed and rode his #way#
and by the same #way# that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ should ride he laid him down to #rest# charging his squire to wait upon sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and warn me when he cometh
so within a while sir $kay_the_seneschal$ came riding that #way# and then sir $gaheris$ took his horse and met him and said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ #ye# are not wise to ride at the request of $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ for he dealeth all with #treason#
sir said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ i will prove it then said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ i require you let us prove this adventure i shall not fail you said sir $gaheris$
and so they rode that time till a lake that was that time called the perilous lake and there they abode under the shaw of the #wood#
the meanwhile $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ within the castle of tintagil avoided all his barons and all other save such as were privy with him were avoided out of his chamber
and then he let call his nephew sir $andred$ and bade #arm# him and horse him lightly and by that time it was midnight
and so $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ was armed in black horse and all and so at a privy postern they two issued out with their varlets with them and
rode till they came to that lake then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ espied them first and gat his spear and proffered to joust
and there at that jousts sir $kay_the_seneschal$ horse fell down for his horse was not so big as the $king_arthur_s_court$ horse and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ horse bruised him full sore
and $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ rode against him and smote each other full hard for the moon shone as the bright #day# then sir $gaheris$ was wroth that sir $kay_the_seneschal$ had a fall
then $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ was afeard of sir $gaheris$ and so with evil will $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ rode against him and sir $gaheris$ gave him such a #stroke# that he fell down
so then forthwithal sir $gaheris$ ran unto sir $andred$ and smote him from his horse quite that his #helm# smote in the earth and #nigh# had broken his #neck#
then he cried $black_knight$ sit thou fast in thy saddle for i will revenge my fellow and therewithal sir $gaheris$ alighted and gat up sir $kay_the_seneschal$
and then they yode both on foot to them and bade them yield them and tell their names outher they should die
then with great pain sir $andred$ spake first and said it is $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ of cornwall therefore be #ye# #ware# what #ye# do and i am sir $andred$ his cousin
fie on you both said sir $gaheris$ for a false traitor and false #treason# hast thou wrought and he both under the feigned #cheer# that #ye# made us
it were pity said sir $gaheris$ that thou shouldst live any longer save my life said $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ and i will make amends and consider that i am a $king_arthur_s_court$ anointed
it were the more shame said sir $gaheris$ to save thy life thou art a $king_arthur_s_court$ anointed with cream and therefore thou shouldst hold with all men of worship and therefore thou art worthy to die
with that he lashed at $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ without saying any more and covered him with his shield and defended him as he might
and then he kneeled adown and made his #oath# upon the cross of the sword that never while he lived he would be against errant #knight#
and then sir $kay_the_seneschal$ lashed at sir $andred$ and therewithal $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$ yielded him unto sir $gaheris$ and also he sware to be good friend unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ if ever he came into cornwall
by then sir $andred$ was on the earth and sir $kay_the_seneschal$ would have slain him let be said sir $gaheris$ slay him
it were pity said sir $kay_the_seneschal$ that he should live any longer for this is #nigh# cousin unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ and ever he hath been a traitor unto him and by him he was exiled out of cornwall and therefore i will slay him said sir $kay_the_seneschal$
not i pray you #ye# shall not said sir $gaheris$ sithen i have given the $king_arthur_s_court$ his life i pray you give him his life
and so sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $gaheris$ rode their #way# unto $dinas$ the $kay_the_seneschal$ for because they heard say that he loved well sir $tristram_de_liones$
and therewithal sir $kay_the_seneschal$ let him go so they reposed them there and soon after they rode unto the realm of logris
and so within a little while they met with sir $launcelot_du_lake$ that always had $dame_bragwaine$ with him to that intent he weened to have met the sooner with sir $tristram_de_liones$ and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ asked what tidings in cornwall and whether they heard of sir $tristram_de_liones$ or not
sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $gaheris$ answered and said that they heard not of him then they told sir $launcelot_du_lake$ word by word of their adventure
then sir $launcelot_du_lake$ smiled and said hard it is to take out of the flesh that is bred in the bone and so made them merry together
now leave we off this tale and speak we of sir $dinas$ that had within the castle a #paramour# and she loved another $black_knight$ better than him
and so when sir $dinas$ went out a hunting she slipped down by a towel and took with her two brachets and so she yede to the $black_knight$ that she loved and he her again
and when sir $dinas$ came home and missed his #paramour# and his brachets then was he the more wrother for his brachets than for the #lady#
chapter xl how after that sir $tristram_de_liones$ sir $palomides$ and sir $dinadan$ had been long in prison they were delivered so then he rode after the $black_knight$ that had his #paramour# and bade him turn and joust
and then his #lady# and #paramour# cried sir $dinas$ mercy and said she would love him better than ever she did
nay said sir $dinas$ i shall never trust them that once betrayed me and therefore as #ye# have begun so end for i will never meddle with you
so sir $dinas$ smote him down that with the fall he #brake# his leg and his #arm# and so sir $dinas$ departed and took his brachets with him and so rode to his castle
that was right heavy that he could never hear no tidings of sir $tristram_de_liones$ for all this while he was in prison with sir $darras$ $palomides$ and $dinadan$
then $dame_bragwaine$ took her leave to go into cornwall and sir $launcelot_du_lake$ sir $kay_the_seneschal$ and sir $gaheris$ rode to seek sir $tristram_de_liones$ in the country of surluse
now speaketh this tale of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and of his two fellows for every #day# sir $palomides$ brawled and said language against sir $tristram_de_liones$
now will we turn unto sir $launcelot_du_lake$ i #marvel# said sir $dinadan$ of thee sir $palomides$ an thou haddest sir $tristram_de_liones$ here
thou wouldst do him no harm for an a wolf and a sheep were together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in #peace#
and #wit# thou well said sir $dinadan$ this same is sir $tristram_de_liones$ at a word and now must thou do thy best with him and let see now if #ye# can skift it with your hands
sir $palomides$ then said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i have heard much of your maugre against me but i will not meddle with you as at this time by my will because i dread the lord of this place that hath us in governance
for an i dread him not more than i do thee soon it should be skift so they peaced themself
right so came in a $damosel_of_the_lake$ and said #knight# be of good #cheer# for #ye# are sure of your lives and that i heard say my lord sir $darras$
then was sir $palomides$ abashed and said little then were they glad all three for daily they weened they should have died
then soon after this sir $tristram_de_liones$ fell sick that he weened to have died then sir $dinadan$ wept and so did sir $palomides$ under them both making great #sorrow#
then she went unto sir $darras$ and told him how that mighty $black_knight$ that bare the black shield was likely to die
that shall not be said sir $darras$ for god defend when #knight# come to me for succour that i should suffer them to die within my prison
so a $damosel_of_the_lake$ came in to them and found them mourning therefore said sir $darras$ to the $damosel_of_the_lake$ fetch that $black_knight$ and his fellows afore me
he said sir $black_knight$ me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art called a full noble $black_knight$ and so it seemeth by thee and #wit# #ye#
well it shall never be said that sir $darras$ shall destroy such a noble $black_knight$ as thou art in prison howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons whereby i was greatly aggrieved
thou go and thy fellows and your harness and horses have been fair and clean kept and #ye# shall go where it liketh you upon this covenant
that thou $black_knight$ wilt promise me to be good friend to my sons two that be now alive and also that thou tell me thy name
sir said he as for me my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ and in cornwall was i born and nephew i am unto $king_arthur_s_court$ $king_mark$
and as for the death of your sons i might not do withal for an they had been the next kin that i have i might have done #none# otherwise
and then anon sir $darras$ saw sir $tristram_de_liones$ brought afore him but now shalt and if i had slain them by #treason# or treachery i had been worthy to have died
all this i consider said sir $darras$ that all that #ye# did was by #force# of knighthood and that was the #cause# i would not put you to death
but sith #ye# be sir $tristram_de_liones$ the good $black_knight$ i pray you heartily to be my good friend and to my sons
ever while i live i will do you service for #ye# have done to us but as a natural $black_knight$ ought to do
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ reposed him there till that he was amended of his sickness and when he was big and strong they took their leave and every $black_knight$ took their horses and so departed and rode together till they came to a cross #way#
sir said sir $tristram_de_liones$ i promise you by the faith of my body now fellows said sir $tristram_de_liones$ here will we depart in sundry #way#
how sir $dinadan$ rescued a #lady# from sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ received a shield of $queen_morgan_le_fay$
and because sir $dinadan$ had the first adventure of him i will begin chapter xli so as sir $dinadan$ rode by a well he found a #lady# making great dole
sir $black_knight$ said the #lady# i am the wofullest #lady# of the world for within these five #day# here came a $black_knight$ called sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ and he slew mine own brother and ever since he hath kept me at his own will and of all men in the world i hate him most and therefore i require you of knighthood to avenge me for he will not tarry but be here anon
what aileth you said sir $dinadan$ let him come said sir $dinadan$ and because of honour of all women i will do my part
with this came sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ and when he saw a $black_knight$ with his #lady# he was #wood# wroth and then he said sir $black_knight$ keep thee from me
so they hurtled together as thunder and either smote other passing sore but sir $dinadan$ put him through the shoulder a grievous #wound# and or ever sir $dinadan$ might turn him
then the #lady# prayed him to bring her to a castle there beside but four mile thence and so sir $dinadan$ brought her there and she was welcome for the lord of that castle was her uncle and so sir $dinadan$ rode his #way# upon his adventure
now turn we this tale unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that by adventure he came to a castle to ask lodging wherein was $queen_morgan_le_fay$ and so when sir $tristram_de_liones$ was let into that castle he had good #cheer# all that night
and upon the morn when he would have departed the #queen# said #wit# #ye# well #ye# shall not depart lightly for #ye# are here as a #prisoner#
sir $breuse_saunce_pite$ was gone and fled $o_jesu$ defend said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for i was but late a #prisoner# fair $black_knight$ said the #queen# #ye# shall abide with me till
that i #wit# what #ye# are and from whence #ye# come and ever the #queen# would set sir $tristram_de_liones$ on her own side and her #paramour# on the other side
and ever $queen_morgan_le_fay$ would behold sir $tristram_de_liones$ and thereat the $black_knight$ was jealous and was in will suddenly to have run upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ with a sword but he left it for shame
then the #queen# said to sir $tristram_de_liones$ tell me thy name and i shall suffer you to depart when #ye# will
upon that covenant i tell you my name is sir $tristram_de_liones$ ah said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ an i had wist that thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou shalt
but sithen i have made a promise i will hold it with that thou wilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield that i shall deliver thee unto the castle of the hard rock where $king_arthur_s_court$ had cried a great #tournament# and there i pray you that #ye# will be and to do for me as much deeds of #arm# as #ye# may do
for at the castle of #maiden# sir $tristram_de_liones$ #ye# did marvellous deeds of #arm# as ever i heard $black_knight$ do madam said sir $tristram_de_liones$ let me see the shield that i shall bear
then the shield was brought forth and the field was goldish with a $king_arthur_s_court$ and a #queen# therein painted and a $black_knight$ standing above them one foot upon the $king_arthur_s_court$ #head# and the other upon the #queen#
madam said sir $tristram_de_liones$ this is a fair shield and a mighty but what signifieth this $king_arthur_s_court$ and this #queen# and the $black_knight$ standing upon both their #head#
i shall tell you said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ it signifieth $king_arthur_s_court$ and #queen# $dame_guenever$ and a $black_knight$ who holdeth them both in bondage and in servage
but as the french book saith $queen_morgan_le_fay$ loved sir $launcelot_du_lake$ best and ever she desired him and he would never love her nor do nothing at her request and therefore she held many #knight# together for to have taken him by strength
and because she deemed that sir $launcelot_du_lake$ loved #queen# $dame_guenever$ #paramour# and she him again therefore $queen_morgan_le_fay$ ordained that shield to put sir $launcelot_du_lake$ to a #rebuke# to that intent that $king_arthur_s_court$ might understand the love between them
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ took that shield and promised her to bear it at the #tournament# at the castle of the hard rock
who is that $black_knight$ said sir $tristram_de_liones$ that shall #ye# not #wit# as at this time said the #queen# but sir $tristram_de_liones$ knew not that that shield was ordained against sir $launcelot_du_lake$ but afterward he knew it
chapter xlii how sir $tristram_de_liones$ took with him the shield and also how he slew the #paramour# of $queen_morgan_le_fay$
then came the $black_knight$ that held $queen_morgan_le_fay$ his name was sir hemison and he made him ready to follow sir $tristram_de_liones$
so then sir $tristram_de_liones$ took his leave of the #queen# and took the shield with him fair friend said $queen_morgan_le_fay$ ride not after that $black_knight$ for #ye# shall not win no worship of him
fie on him coward said sir hemison for i wist never good $black_knight$ come out of cornwall but if it were sir $tristram_de_liones$
what an that be he said she nay nay said he he is with $lady_la_beale_isoud$ and this is but a daffish $black_knight$
alas my fair friend #ye# shall find him the best $black_knight$ that ever #ye# met withal for i know him better than #ye# do
ah fair friend said the #queen# me repenteth that #ye# will follow that $black_knight$ for i fear me sore of your again coming
with this this $black_knight$ rode his #way# #wood# wroth and he rode after sir $tristram_de_liones$ as fast as he had been chased with #knight#
for your sake said sir hemison i shall slay him when sir $tristram_de_liones$ heard a $black_knight$ come after him so fast he returned about and saw a $black_knight$ coming against him
then they rushed together as it had been thunder and sir hemison brised his spear upon sir $tristram_de_liones$ but his harness was so good that he might not #hurt# him
and when he came #nigh# to sir $tristram_de_liones$ he cried on high sir $black_knight$ keep thee from me and sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote him harder and bare him through the body and he fell over his horse croup
then sir $tristram_de_liones$ turned to have done more with his sword but he saw so much blood go from him that him seemed he was likely to die and so he departed from him and came to a fair manor to an old $black_knight$ and there sir $tristram_de_liones$ lodged
chapter xliii how $queen_morgan_le_fay$ buried her #paramour# and how sir $tristram_de_liones$ praised sir $launcelot_du_lake$ and his kin now leave to speak of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and speak we of the $black_knight$ that was wounded to the death
then his varlet alighted and took off his #helm# and then he asked his lord whether there were any life in him
life said the $black_knight$ but it is but little and therefore leap thou up behind me when thou hast holpen me up and hold me fast that i fall not and bring me to $queen_morgan_le_fay$ for deep draughts of death draw to my heart that i may not live for i would fain speak with her or
there is in me i died for else my #soul# will be in great peril an i die for thwith with great pain his varlet brought him to the castle and there sir hemison fell down dead
when $queen_morgan_le_fay$ saw him dead she made great #sorrow# out of reason and then she let despoil him unto his shirt and so she let him put into a #tomb#
and about the #tomb# she let write here lieth sir hemison slain by the hands of sir $tristram_de_liones$ now turn we unto sir $tristram_de_liones$ that asked the $black_knight$ his host if he saw late any #knight# adventurous
sir he said the last night here lodged with me $ector_de_maris$ and a $damosel_of_the_lake$ with him and that $damosel_of_the_lake$ told me that he was one of the best #knight# of the world
that is not so said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for i know four better #knight# of his own blood and the first is sir $launcelot_du_lake$ call him the best $black_knight$ and sir $bors_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ sir $bleoberis_de_ganis$ sir $blamore_de_ganis$ de $bleoberis_de_ganis$ and sir $gaheris$
that is not so said sir $tristram_de_liones$ for i have met with them both and i felt sir $gaheris$ for the better $black_knight$ and sir $lamorak_de_galis$
nay said his host $sir_gawaine$ is a better $black_knight$ than he i call him as good as any of them except sir $launcelot_du_lake$
why name #ye# not sir $tristram_de_liones$ said his host for i account him as good as any of them i know not sir $tristram_de_liones$ said $tristram_de_liones$
and on the morn sir $tristram_de_liones$ departed and took his leave of his host and rode toward the roche dure and #none# adventure had sir $tristram_de_liones$ but that and so he rested not till he came to the castle where he saw five hundred tents
thus they talked and bourded as long as them list and then went to #rest# chapter xliv how sir $tristram_de_liones$ at a #tournament# bare the shield that $queen_morgan_le_fay$ delivered to him
then the $king_arthur_s_court$ of scots and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland held against $king_arthur_s_court$ #knight# and there began a great medley
so came in sir $tristram_de_liones$ and did marvellous deeds of #arm# for there he smote down many #knight# and ever he was afore $king_arthur_s_court$ with that shield
and when $king_arthur_s_court$ saw that shield he marvelled greatly in what intent it was made but #queen# $dame_guenever$ deemed as it was wherefore
then was there a $damosel_of_the_lake$ of $queen_morgan_le_fay$ in a chamber by $king_arthur_s_court$ and when she heard $king_arthur_s_court$ speak of that shield then she spake openly unto $king_arthur_s_court$
sir $king_arthur_s_court$ #wit# #ye# well this shield was ordained for you to warn you of your shame and dishonour and that longeth to you and your #queen#
she was heavy and then anon that $damosel_of_the_lake$ picked her away privily that no man wist where she was become then was $king_arthur_s_court$ sad and wroth and asked from whence came that $damosel_of_the_lake$
then #queen# $dame_guenever$ called to her sir $ector_de_maris$ and there she made her #complaint# to him and said i wot well this shield was made by $queen_morgan_le_fay$ in despite of me and of sir $launcelot_du_lake$ wherefore i dread me sore lest i should be destroyed
and ever the $king_arthur_s_court$ beheld sir $tristram_de_liones$ that did so marvellous deeds of #arm# that he wondered sore what $black_knight$ he might be and well he wist it was not sir $launcelot_du_lake$
and it was told him that sir $tristram_de_liones$ was in petit britain with $lady_la_beale_isoud$ la $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ for he deemed an he had been in the realm of logris sir $launcelot_du_lake$ or some of his fellows that were in the #quest# of sir $tristram_de_liones$ that they should have found him or that time
there was not one that knew her nor wist where she was become so $king_arthur_s_court$ had #marvel# what $black_knight$ he might be
then ever sir $tristram_de_liones$ smote down #knight# wonderly to behold what upon the right hand and upon the left hand that unnethe no $black_knight$ might withstand him
and ever sir $king_arthur_s_court$ eye was on that shield all that espied the #queen# and that made her sore afeard and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of scots and the $king_arthur_s_court$ of ireland began to withdraw them
when $king_arthur_s_court$ espied that he thought that that $black_knight$ with the strange shield should not escape him then he called unto him sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ le $isoud_la_blanche_mains$ and bade him #arm# him and make him ready
so anon $king_arthur_s_court$ and sir $uwaine_les_avoutres$ dressed them before sir $tristram_de_liones$ and required him to tell them where he had that shield
so here endeth this history of this book for it is the first book of sir $tristram_de_liones$ and the second book of sir $tristram_de_liones$ followeth
