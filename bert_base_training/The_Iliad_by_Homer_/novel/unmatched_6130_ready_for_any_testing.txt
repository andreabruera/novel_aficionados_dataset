to be content with what we at present know is for the most part to shut our ear against conviction since from the very gradual character of our education we must continually forget and emancipate ourselves from knowledge previously acquired we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones and as we learn we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire
and this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice and in which persons and things are day by day finding their real level in lieu of their conventional value
the same principles which have swept away traditional abuses and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists and stripping the thin tawdry veil from attractive superstitions are working as actively in literature as in society
the credulity of one writer or the partiality of another finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists as the dreams of conservatism or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the church
history and tradition whether of ancient or comparatively recent time are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former age could allow
mere statements are jealously watched and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history as the facts he records
probability is a powerful and troublesome test and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is sifted
funeral of stern_hector introduction scepticism is as much the result of knowledge as knowledge is of scepticism consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands
in brief to write a history we must know more than mere facts human nature viewed under an induction of extended experience is the best help to the criticism of human history
to form correct view of individuals we must regard them as forming part of a great whole we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded and in contemplating the incidents in their life or condition which tradition has handed down to us we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative than the respective probability of its details
historical character can only be estimated by the standard which human experience whether actual or traditionary has furnished it is unfortunate for us that of some of the greatest man we know least and talk most
homer socrates and shakespere have perhaps contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow
the personality of shakespere is perhaps the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy but upon everything else even down to the authorship of plays there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty
of socrates we know as little as the contradictions of plato and xenophon will allow us to know he was one of the dramatis personae in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style
he appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down
when we have read plato or xenophon we think we know something of socrates when we have fairly read and examined both we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant
it has been an easy and a popular expedient of late year to deny the personal or real existence of man and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief
this system which has often comforted the religious sceptic and substituted the consolations of strauss for those of the new testament has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries
to question the existence of alexander the great would be a more excusable act than to believe in that of romulus
to deny a fact related in herodotus because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way is more pardonable than to believe in the good natured old king whom the elegant pen of florian has idealized numa pompilius
scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to homer and the state of our homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory provided we throw overboard all written tradition concerning the author or author of the iliad and odyssey
what few authorities exist on the subject are summarily dismissed although the arguments appear to run in a circle this cannot be true because it is not true and that is not true because it cannot be true
such seems to be the style in which testimony upon testimony statement upon statement is consigned to denial and oblivion
it is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of homer are partly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in which truth is the requisite most wanting
before taking a brief review of the homeric theory in its present conditions some notice must be taken of the treatise on the life of homer which has been attributed to herodotus
according to this document the city of cumae in ćolia was at an early period the seat of frequent immigrations from various part of greece
among the immigrants was menapolus the son of ithagenes although poor he married and the result of the union was a girl named critheis
the girl was left an orphan at an early age under the guardianship of cleanax of argos it is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we are indebted for so much happiness
homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty and received the name of melesigenes from having been born near the river meles in boeotia whither critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation
at this time continues our narrative there lived at smyrna a man named phemius a teacher of literature and music who not being married engaged critheis to manage his household and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labour
so satisfactory was her performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he made proposals of marriage declaring himself as a further inducement willing to adopt her son who he asserted would become a clever man if he were carefully brought up
they were married careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed and melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment and when older rivalled his preceptor in wisdom
melesigenes carried on his adopted father school with great success exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of smyrna but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there especially in the exportation of corn attracted to that city
among these visitors one mentes from leucadia the modern santa maura who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those time persuaded melesigenes to close his school and accompany him on his travels
he promised not only to pay his expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that while he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his own eye the country and city which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses
melesigenes consented and set out with his patron examining all the curiosities of the country they visited and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met
we may also suppose that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation having set sail from tyrrhenia and iberia they reached ithaca
here melesigenes who had already suffered in his eye became much worse and mentes who was about to leave for leucadia left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his named mentor the son of alcinor
under his hospitable and intelligent host melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting ulysses which afterwards formed the subject of the odyssey
the inhabitants of ithaca assert that it was here that melesigenes became blind but the colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune
phemius died leaving him sole heir to his property and his mother soon followed he then returned to smyrna where he applied himself to the study of poetry
but poverty soon drove him to cumae having passed over the hermaean plain he arrived at neon teichos the new wall a colony of cumae
and up to my time continued the author the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot
here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one tychias an armourer here also a poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since melesigenes arrived
here the cumans say he composed an epitaph on gordius king of phrygia which has however and with greater probability been attributed to cleobulus of lindus
arrived at cumae he frequented the converzationes of the old man and delighted all by the charm of his poetry
encouraged by this favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a public maintenance he would render their city most gloriously renowned
but poverty still drove him on and he went by way of larissa as being the most convenient road they avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed and procured him an audience in the council
having made the speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal
the greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet demand but one man observed that if they were to feed homers they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people
with a love of economy which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary man the pension was denied and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory
from this circumstance says the writer melesigenes acquired the name of homer for the cumans call blind man homers at phocoea homer was destined to experience another literary distress
one thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius kept homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name
having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable thestorides like some would be literary publishers neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him
at his departure homer is said to have observed thestorides of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible than
the human heart homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some chian merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite acquainted him with the fact that thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poem
no vessel happened then to be setting sail thither but he found one ready to start for erythrae a town of ionia which face that island and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them
having embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of thestorides who by his breach of hospitality had drawn down the wrath of which_jove the hospitable
at erythrae homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in phocoea by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty reached the little hamlet of pithys
this at once determined him to set out for chios here he met with an adventure which we will continue in the word of our author
having set out from pithys homer went on attracted by the cry of some goats that were pasturing the dog barked on his approach and he cried out
glaucus for that was the name of the goat herd heard his voice ran up quickly called off his dog and drove them away from homer
for or some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone and what could be his design in coming
he then went up to him and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate place and untrodden spots and of what he stood in need
homer by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup
the dog instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according to their usual habit whereupon homer addressed glaucus thus glaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest
first give the dog their supper at the doors of the hut for so it is better since whilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold
glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author having finished supper they banqueted afresh on conversation homer narrating his wanderings and telling of the city he had visited
at length they retired to rest but on the following morning glaucus resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting with homer
having arrived at bolissus a place near the farm and finding his mate he told him the whole story respecting homer and his journey
he paid little attention to what he said and blamed glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons
having left the goats in charge of a fellow servant he left homer at home promising to return quickly however he bade him bring the stranger to him
glaucus told homer what had taken place and bade him follow him assuring him that good fortune would be the result
conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge and the chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake the charge of his children
besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor thestorides from the island homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher in the town of chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry
to this day says chandler the most curious remain is that which has been named without reason the school of homer
it is on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open temple of cybele formed on the top of a rock
the shape is oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess the head and an arm wanting
she is represented as usual sitting the chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back the area is bounded by a low rim or seat and about five yards over
the whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity so successful was this school that homer realised a considerable fortune
the following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poem with the history of the poet which has already been mentioned
in his poetical compositions homer displays great gratitude towards mentor of ithaca in the odyssey whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of ulysses in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness
he married and had two daughter one of whom died single the other married a chian he also testifies his gratitude to phemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction
having it is said made some additions to his poem calculated to please the vanity of the athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention he sent out for samos
here being recognized by a samian who had met with him in chios he was handsomely received and invited to join in celebrating the apaturian festival
he recited some verses which gave great satisfaction and by singing the eiresione at the new moon festivals he earned a subsistence visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was very popular
in the spring he sailed for athens and arrived at the island of ios now ino where he fell extremely ill and died
it is said that his death arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermen children
such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of homer we possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail
let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering patient and learned but by no means consistent series of investigations has led
his celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him to visit greece whither his reputation had now extended in doing so i profess to bring forward statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability
the history of this poet and his work is lost in doubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first mind who have done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness
the majestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the nile through many land and nation and like the sources of the nile its fountains will ever remain concealed
such are the word in which one of the most judicious german critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the homeric question is involved
with no less truth and feeling he proceeds it seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible
homer appeared if the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light
the creations of genius always seem like miracles because they are for the most part created far out of the reach of observation
if we were in possession of all the historical testimonies we never could wholly explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssey for their origin in all essential point must have remained the secret of the poet
from this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire drawings of scholastic investigation let us pass on to the main question at issue
was homer an individual or were the iliad and odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poet
well has landor remarked some tell us there were twenty homers some deny that there was ever one it were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase in order to let them settle at last
we are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure our devotion to superior power of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us
my opinion is that what is best for us is our admiration of good no man living venerates homer more than i do
but greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the homeric question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period to prefer his judgment to his imagination and to condescend to dry details
before however entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the homeric poem at least of the iliad i must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks
we cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better the poetic age of greece almost conclusive testimony to its original composition
it was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question nor is it injustice to assert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole
the most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame and we would take the opinion of chantrey or westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form rather than that of mr brodie or sir astley cooper
there is some truth though some malicious exaggeration in the line of pope the critic eye that microscope of wit
sees hair and pores examines bit by bit how part relate to part or they to whole the body harmony the beaming soul are things which kuster burmann wasse shall see when man whole frame is obvious to a flea
long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the homeric poem
the grave and cautious thucydides quoted without hesitation the hymn to apollo the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics
longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the odyssey to the iliad and among a mass of ancient author whose very name it would be tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal non existence of homer ever arose
so far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim
at the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on the subject and we find bentley remarking that homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and good cheer at festivals and other day of merriment
these loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about peisistratus time about five hundred year after
two french writers hedelin and perrault avowed a similar scepticism on the subject but it is in the scienza nuova of battista vico that we first meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by wolf with so much learning and acuteness
indeed it is with the wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following bold hypothesis which we will detail in the word of grote
half a century ago the acute and valuable prolegomena of a wolf turning to account the venetian scholia which had then been recently published first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the homeric text
a considerable part of that dissertation though by no means the whole is employed in vindicating the position previously announced by bentley amongst other that the separate constituent portions of the iliad and odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order until the day of peisistratus in the sixth century before christ
as a step towards that conclusion wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier time to which their composition is referred and that without writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him transmitted with assurance to posterity
the absence of easy and convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts among the early greeks was thus one of the point in wolf case against the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey
by nitzsch and other leading opponents of wolf the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the iliad and odyssey to maintain that they were written poem from the beginning
to me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by wolf to peisistratus and his associates in reference to the homeric poem are nowise admissible
but much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poem in the ninth century before the christian aera
few things in my opinion can be more improbable and mr payne knight opposed as he is to the wolfian hypothesis admits this no less than wolf himself
we have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth olympiad and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed nor can we even assure ourselves whether archilochus simonides of amorgus kallinus tyrtaeus xanthus and the other early elegiac and lyric poet committed their compositions to writing or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar
the first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of homer is in the famous ordinance of solon with regard to the rhapsodies at the panathenaea but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed we are unable to say
those who maintain the homeric poem to have been written from the beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry for they admit generally that the iliad and odyssey were not read but recited and heard but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poem the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy
but here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater for the existence of trained bards gifted with extraordinary memory
is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts in an age essentially non reading and non writing and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious
moreover there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript for if such had been the fact blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession which we know that it was not as well from the example of demodokus in the odyssey as from that of the blind bard of chios in the hymn to the delian apollo whom thucydides as well as the general tenor of grecian legend identifies with homer himself
the author of that hymn be he who he may could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest
the traces of writing in greece even in the seventh century before the christian aera are exceedingly trifling
the loss of the digamma that crux of critics that quicksand upon which even the acumen of bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyond a doubt that the pronunciation of the greek language had undergone a considerable change
now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the homeric poem could have suffered by this change had written copies been preserved
if chaucer poetry for instance had not been written it could only have come down to us in a softened form more like the effeminate version of dryden than the rough quaint noble original
at what period continues grote these poem or indeed any other greek poem first began to be written must be matter of conjecture though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of solon
if in the absence of evidence we may venture upon naming any more determinate period the question a once suggests itself what were the purposes which in that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer
not for the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the memory but also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice pauses and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce
not for the general public they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival
the only persons for whom the written iliad would be suitable would be a select few studious and curious man a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the written word realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter
incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present there is in all early societies and there was in early greece a time when no such reading class existed
if we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poem were first committed to writing
now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in greece is the middle of the seventh century before the christian aera c to c the age of terpander kallinus archilochus simonides of amorgus
i ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of grecian poetry and music the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life
such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable yet
it argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect and the man who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from their own individual point of view the written word of the homeric rhapsodies just as we are told that kallinus both noticed and eulogized the thebais as the production of homer
there seems therefore ground for conjecturing that for the use of this newly formed and important but very narrow class manuscripts of the homeric poem and other old epics the thebais and the cypria as well as the iliad and the odyssey began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century c and the opening of egypt to grecian commerce which took place about the same period would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon
a reading class when once formed would doubtless slowly increase and the number of manuscripts along with it so that before the time of solon fifty year afterwards both readers and manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained a certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes
but even peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations
there are several incidental circumstances which in our opinion throw some suspicion over the whole history of the peisistratid compilation at least over the theory that the iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the athenian ruler
for whom was a written iliad necessary the nearest approaching to the sense if the great poet who flourished at the bright period of grecian song of which alas
we have inherited little more than the fame and the faint echo if stesichorus anacreon and simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the iliad and odyssey so much must have been done to arrange to connect to harmonize that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of athenian manufacture should not remain
whatever occasional anomalies may be detected anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the homeric age however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our bentleys to whom the name of argive_helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the hero of her age however mr knight may have failed in reducing the homeric language to its primitive form however finally the attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics still it is difficult to suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and transitions and connecting part should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern form of expression
it is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original as sir walter scott has done in his continuation of sir tristram
if however not even such faint and indistinct traces of athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poem the total absence of athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation
in later and it may fairly be suspected in earlier time the athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors
but amid all the traditions of the glory of early greece embodied in the iliad the athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part
it is possible indeed that in its leading outline the iliad may be true to historic fact that in the great maritime expedition of western greece against the rival and half kindred empire of the laomedontiadae the chieftain of thessaly from his valour and the number of his force may have been the most important ally of the peloponnesian sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the athenians to yield to their taste
the songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and popularity or at first sight a theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an athenian synod of compilers of ancient song than an achilleid or an olysseid
even the few passage which relate to their ancestors mr knight suspects to be interpolations could france have given birth to a tasso tancred would have been the hero of the jerusalem
if however the homeric ballads as they are sometimes called which related the wrath of achilles with all its direful consequences were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle as to admit no rivalry it is still surprising that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an athenian hand and that the national spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours the french should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors or at least to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age
while it is to be confessed that wolf objections to the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey have never been wholly got over we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset are rather augmented than otherwise if we admit his hypothesis
he divides the first twenty two book of the iliad into sixteen different songs and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of peisistratus
to return to the wolfian theory nor is lachmann modification of his theory any better this as grote observes explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else
moreover we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the so called sixteen poet concur in getting rid of the following leading man in the first battle after the secession of achilles
elphenor chief of the euboeans tlepolemus of the rhodians pandarus of the lycians odius of the halizonians pirous and acamas of the thracians
none of these hero again make their appearance and we can but agree with colonel mure that it seems strange that any number of independent poet should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel
the discrepancy by which pylaemenes who is represented as dead in the fifth book weeps at his son funeral in the thirteenth can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation
grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the wolfian theory and of lachmann modifications with the character of peisistratus
but he has also shown and we think with equal success that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poem or supposing that impossible the unison of these part by peisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct
in short a man may believe the iliad to have been put together out of pre existing songs without recognising the age of peisistratus as the period of its first compilation
the friend or literary employes of peisistratus must have found an iliad that was already ancient and the silence of the alexandrine critics respecting the peisistratic recension goes far to prove that among the numerous manuscripts they examined this was either wanting or thought unworthy of attention
there is nothing either in the iliad or odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age of peisistratus nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two centuries in the greek language the coined money the habits of writing and reading the despotisms and republican governments the close military array the improved construction of ship the amphiktyonic convocations the mutual frequentation of religious festivals the oriental and egyptian veins of religion familiar to the latter epoch
these alterations onomakritus and the other literary friend of peisistratus could hardly have failed to notice even without design had they then for the first time undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate
everything in the two great homeric poem both in substance and in language belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than peisistratus
indeed even the interpolations or those passage which on the best ground are pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before christ and may well have been heard by archilochus and kallinus in some cases even by arktinus and hesiod as genuine homeric matter
as far as the evidences on the case as well internal as external enable us to judge we seem warranted in believing that the iliad and odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand always allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations in c our first trustworthy mark of grecian time and this ancient date let it be added as it is the best authenticated fact so it is also the most important attribute of the homeric poem considered in reference to grecian history for they thus afford us an insight into the anti historical character of the greeks enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition
on the whole i am inclined to believe that the labour of peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although i must confess that i can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labour
at the same time so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poem in their present form was the work of peisistratus i am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poem rather than to patch and re construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis
i will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poem were written or not or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author
moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poem themselves confirms what is here remarked suffice it to say that the more we read the less satisfied we are upon either subject
i cannot however help thinking that the story which attributes the preservation of these poem to lycurgus is little else than a version of the same story as that of peisistratus while its historical probability must be measured by that of many other relating to the spartan confucius
i will conclude this sketch of the homeric theories with an attempt made by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like consistency
no doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common sailors of some fifty year ago some one qualified to discourse in excellent music among them
many of these like those of the negroes in the united state were extemporaneous and allusive to events passing around them
the grand events of a spirit stirring war occurrences likely to impress themselves as the mystical legends of former time had done upon their memory besides which a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient time
it is as follows but what was passing around them ballads at first and down to the beginning of the war with troy were merely recitations with an intonation
then followed a species of recitative probably with an intoned burden tune next followed as it aided the memory considerably
it was at this period about four hundred year after the war that a poet flourished of the name of melesigenes or moeonides but most probably the former
he saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of hellas and as a collection he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own
the author however did not affix his own name to the poem which in fact was great part of it remodelled from the archaic dialect of crete in which tongue the ballads were found by him
he therefore called it the poem of homeros or the collector but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people ideas for as grote has finely observed arguing for the unity of authorship a great poet might have re cast pre existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so
this poem now exists under the title of the odyssea while employed on the wild legend of odysseus he met with a ballad recording the quarrel of achilles and agamemnon
unity of design however caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together like those relating to the cid into a chronicle history named the iliad
melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved but first the poem were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions by the people who took to singing them in the streets assemblies and agoras
however solon first and then peisistratus and afterwards aristoteles and other revised the poem and restored the work of melesigenes homeros to their original integrity in a great measure
having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject i must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the homeric poem
to deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist would be an absurd and captious assumption but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoy these poem
his noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself and the achilleis grew under his hand in maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author be he homer or melesigenes quocunque
i feel conscious that while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great work to a plurality of author the most powerful internal evidence and that which spring from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul also speaks eloquently to the contrary
nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit the minutiae of verbal criticism i am far from seeking to despise indeed considering the character of some of my own book such an attempt would be gross inconsistency
but while i appreciate its importance in a philological view i am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic value especially in poetry
three part of the emendations made upon poet are mere alterations some of which had they been suggested to the author by his maecenas or africanus he would probably have adopted
moreover those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation are often least competent to carry out their own precepts
i do not at this moment remember two emendations on homer calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage although a mass of remarks from herodotus down to loewe have given us the history of a thousand minute point without which our greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune
grammarians are not poet by profession but may be so per accidens but it is not on word only that grammarians mere grammarians will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity
binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his word and sentences they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything
but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out book after book passage after passage till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments or till those who fancied they possessed the work of some great man find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand
if we compare the theories of knight wolf lachmann and other we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of homer
one rejects what another considers the turning point of his theory one cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else
justus lipsius a scholar of no ordinary skill seems to revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies attributed to seneca are by four different author
now i will venture to assert that these tragedies are so uniform not only in their borrowed phraseology a phraseology with which writers like boethius and saxo grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves in their freedom from real poetry and last but not least in an ultra refined and consistent abandonment of good taste that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman be he seneca or not to produce not only these but a great many more equally bad
with equal sagacity father hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the ćneid of virgil and the satires of horace were literary deceptions
now without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning nay the refined acuteness which scholars like wolf have bestowed upon this subject i must express my fear that many of our modern homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity
nor can i help thinking that the literary history of more recent time will account for many point of difficulty in the transmission of the iliad and odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation
i have already expressed my belief that the labour of peisistratus were of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of homer may not have been abroad in his day than that the poem of valerius flaccus and tibullus should have given so much trouble to poggio scaliger and other
but after all the main fault in all the homeric theories is that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals and which are its most fitting judges
the ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of homer does too much violence to that inward emotion which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of chios
to believe the author of the iliad a mere compiler is to degrade the power of human invention to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus
nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty there is a catholicity so to speak in the very name of homer
our faith in the author of the iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has taught us a better
while however i look upon the belief in homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring while i can join with old ennius in believing in homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hovers round the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gift from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust still
i am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poem found a rich fund of tradition a well stocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and embellishment
but it is one thing to use existing romances in the embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem itself from such materials
what consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt or rather what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result
a blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other bards are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality
in fact the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions nay even his own thought are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination
but unless there be some grand pervading principle some invisible yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole a poem like the iliad can never come to the birth
local associations teeming with the thought of god and great man may crowd in one mighty vision or reveal themselves in more substantial form to the mind of the poet but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have nought but a scrap book a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento of rags and tatters which will require little acuteness to detect
sensible as i am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and aware as i must be of the weighty ground there are for opposing my belief it still seems to me that the homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained
we are not by nature intended to know all things still less to compass the power by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal
traditions the most picturesque episodes the most pathetic were faith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why god willed our ignorance on any matter
but we are too well taught the contrary lesson and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the man and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity
and there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter
long and habitual reading of homer appears to familiarize our thought even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover
in reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into hero of the time being we in imagination must fight over the same battle woo the same love burn with the same sense of injury as an achilles or a stern_hector
and if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of homer we shall feel that the poem of homer are not only the work of one writer but of the greatest writer that ever touched the heart of man by the power of song
and it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poem their powerful influence over the mind of the man of old
heeren who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely observes it was homer who formed the character of the greek nation
prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the character of other nation it was reserved to a poet to form that of the greeks
no poet has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his countrymen this is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy
when lawgivers and sages appeared in greece the work of the poet had already been accomplished and they paid homage to his superior genius
he held up before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world of god and hero no less than of feeble mortal and to behold them reflected with purity and truth
his poem are founded on the first feeling of human nature on the love of children wife and country on that passion which outweighs all other the love of glory
his songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man and therefore they enter and will continue to enter every breast which cherishes the same sympathies
if it is granted to his immortal spirit from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the nation from the field of asia to the forests of hercynia performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand of elevated of glorious productions which had been called into being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may reside this alone would suffice to complete his happiness
can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the apotheosis of homer is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our mind is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition
the more we read and the more we think think as becomes the readers of homer the more rooted becomes the conviction that the father of poetry gave us this rich inheritance whole and entire
whatever were the means of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other
as the hymns and some other poem usually ascribed to homer are not included in pope translation i will content myself with a brief account of the battle of the frogs and mice from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice this poem says coleridge is a short mock heroic of ancient date
the text varies in different editions and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of homer genius other have attributed it to the same pigrees mentioned above and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit the author of which was uncertain so little did the greeks before the age of the ptolemies know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings
as to this little poem being a youthful prolusion of homer it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody not only of the general spirit but of the numerous passage of the iliad itself and even if no such intention to parody were discernible in it the objection would still remain that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste which the history of every other people in europe and of many in asia has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the iliad that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the god as is contained in this poem and the fact of there having existed three other poem of the same kind attributed for aught we can see with as much reason to homer is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the homeric age
knight infers from the usage of the word deltos writing tablet instead of diphthera skin which according to herod was the material employed by the asiatic greeks for that purpose that this poem was another offspring of attic ingenuity and generally that the familiar mention of the cock is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition
having thus given a brief account of the poem comprised in pope design i will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation and on my own purpose in the present edition
pope was not a grecian his whole education had been irregular and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of ogilby
it is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language
there are to be sure certain conventional anecdotes which prove that pope consulted various friend whose classical attainments were sounder than his own during the undertaking but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original
hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation and in those day what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present
if something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if the charm of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet meaning his word were less jealously sought for and those who could read so good a poem as pope iliad had fair reason to be satisfied
we must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itself a work which is as much a part of english literature as homer himself is of greek
we must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old iliad that once was our most cherished companion or our most looked for prize merely because buttmann loewe and liddell have made us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being an adjective and not a substantive
far be it from us to defend the faults of pope especially when we think of chapman fine bold rough old english far be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation of homer might be
but we can still dismiss pope iliad to the hand of our readers with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of book before they have read its fellow
as to the notes accompanying the present volume they are drawn up without pretension and mainly with the view of helping the general reader
having some little time since translated all the work of homer for another publisher i might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter sometimes of a critical character to bear upon the text
but pope version was no field for such a display and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions to notice occasionally some departures from the original and to give a few parallel passage from our english homer milton
in the latter task i cannot pretend to novelty but i trust that my other annotations while utterly disclaiming high scholastic view will be found to convey as much as is wanted at least as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit
to write a commentary on homer is not my present aim but if i have made pope translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers i shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished
it would be absurd therefore to test pope translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text theodore alois buckley
pope preface to the iliad of homer homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever
the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him and other may have their pretensions as to particular excellences but his invention remains yet unrivalled
nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poet who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry
it is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses the utmost stretch of human study learning and industry which masters everything besides can never attain to this
it furnishes art with all her materials and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a prudent steward that life on managing the riches of nature
whatever praise may be given to work of judgment there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute as in the most regular gardens art can only reduce beauty of nature to more regularity and such a figure which the common eye may better take in and is therefore more entertained with
and perhaps the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature
our author work is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all the beauty so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater
it is like a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify
if some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil and if other are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature
it is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in homer that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him
what he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every thing life and is put in action
if a council be called or a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poet imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a spectator
the course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes hoid ar isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito
it is however remarkable that his fancy which is everywhere vigorous is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and other and becomes on fire like a chariot wheel by its own rapidity
exact disposition just thought correct elocution polished number may have been found in a thousand but this poetic fire this vivida vis animi in a very few
even in work where all those are imperfect or neglected this can overpower criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove
nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour
this fire is discerned in virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected from homer more shining than fierce but everywhere equal and constant in lucan and statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted flashes
in milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art in shakspeare it strikes before we are aware like an accidental fire from heaven but in homer and in him only it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly
i shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent part of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other author
this strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star which in the violence of its course drew all things within its vortex
it seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of art and the whole compass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections all the inward passions and affections of mankind to furnish his character and all the outward form and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable
that which aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into it by homer i shall begin with considering him in his part as it is naturally the first and i speak of it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction
christ church they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the marvellous
the probable fable is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such as though they did became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them
of this sort is the main story of an epic poem the return of ulysses the settlement of the trojans in italy or the like
that of the iliad is the anger of achilles the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet
yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events and crowded with a greater number of council speeches battle and episodes of all kind than are to be found even in those poem whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity
the action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty day
virgil for want of so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both homer poem into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his
the other epic poet have used the same practice but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time
nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story
if he has funeral games for patroclus virgil has the same for anchises and statius rather than omit them destroys the unity of his actions for those of archemorus
if he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their force in the same order if ulysses visit the shade the ćneas of virgil and scipio of silius are sent after him
if he be detained from his return by the allurements of calypso so is ćneas by dido and rinaldo by armida
if achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account
virgil has not only observed this close imitation of homer but where he had not led the way supplied the want from other greek author
thus the story of sinon and the taking of troy was copied says macrobius almost word for word from pisander as the love of dido and ćneas are taken from those of medea and jason in apollonius and several other in the same manner
to proceed to the allegorical fable if we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us
how fertile will that imagination appear which as able to clothe all the properties of elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in form and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed
this is a field in which no succeeding poet could dispute with homer and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it
for when the mode of learning changed in the following age and science was delivered in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poet to lay it aside as it was in homer to make use of it
and perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for virgil that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical part of a poem
if he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour virgil and tasso make the same present to theirs the marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the machines of the god
if homer was not the first who introduced the deities as herodotus imagines into the religion of greece he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those author who have been offended at the literal notion of the god constantly laying their accusation against homer as the chief support of it
but whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various changes of time and religions his god continue to this day the god of poetry
we come now to the character of his persons and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them
every one has something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features than the poet has by their manner
nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices the single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several character of the iliad
that of achilles is furious and intractable that of diomede forward yet listening to advice and subject to command that of oilean_ajax is heavy and self confiding of stern_hector active and vigilant the courage of agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition that of great_menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people we find in idomeneus a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and generous one
nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character but even in the under part of it to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one
for example the main character of ulysses and wise_nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct in this that the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other natural open and regular
but they have besides character of courage and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other upon experience
the character of virgil are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of homer
his character of valour are much alike even that of turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the courage of mnestheus from that of sergestus cloanthus or the rest
in like manner it may be remarked of statius hero that an air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage courage appears in his capaneus tydeus hippomedon
it would be endless to produce instances of these kind they have a parity of character which makes them seem brother of one family
i believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of homer was to that of all other
the speeches are to be considered as they flow from the character being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manner of those who utter them
as there is more variety of character in the iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem
everything in it has manner as aristotle expresses it that is everything is acted or spoken it is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a number of line are employed in narration
in virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thought which might be equally just in any person mouth upon the same occasion
as many of his persons have no apparent character so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety
we oftener think of the author himself when we read virgil than when we are engaged in homer all which are the effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action described
if in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thought
homer makes us hearers and virgil leaves us readers longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part homer principally excelled
what were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the scripture
and it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that if virgil has not so many thought that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad
duport in his gnomologia homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort if we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the invention still predominant
to what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various view presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat
nay he not only gives us the full prospects of things but several unexpected peculiarities and side view unobserved by any painter but homer
nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battle which take up no less than half the iliad and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another such different kind of death that no two hero are wounded in the same manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rises above the last in greatness horror and confusion
it is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is evident of virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master
if we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination of homer shining out in the most enlivened form of it
his expression is like the colouring of some great masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity
we acknowledge him the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the god to man it is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with the greatest spirit
aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who had found out living word there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever
an arrow is impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it
it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and form itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense
this was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and filled the number with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images
on this last consideration i cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention since as he has managed them
to throw his language more out of prose homer seems to have affected the compound epithets they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined
we see the motion of stern_hector plumes in the epithet korythaiolos the landscape of mount neritus in that of einosiphyllos and so of other which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure
lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also
he was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of greece but searched through its different dialects with this particular view to beautify and perfect his number he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength
what he most affected was the ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables so as to make the word open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency
with this he mingled the attic contractions the broader doric and the feebler ćolic which often rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry
thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sound to what they signified
out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in the world
this is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of italian operas will find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other language of poetry
the beauty of his number is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by virgil himself though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the latin tongue indeed the greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its word and the turn and cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language
virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever grace it was capable of and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense
if the grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the roman the only reason is that fewer critics have understood one language than the other
dionysius of halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author beauty in this kind in his treatise of the composition of word
it suffices at present to observe of his number that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine
homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet
they roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while we are borne away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable
as a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets is a short description thus on whatever side we contemplate homer what principally strikes us is his invention
it is that which form the character of each part of his work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other his manner more lively and strongly marked his speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his expression more raised and daring and his number more rapid and various
i hope in what has been said of virgil with regard to any of these head i have no way derogated from his character
nothing is more absurd or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passage in them and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole
we ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him
no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty and as homer has done this in invention virgil has in judgment
not that we are to think that homer wanted judgment because virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that virgil wanted invention because homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great author had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have less in comparison with one another
homer was the greater genius virgil the better artist in one we most admire the man in the other the work
virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out his riches with a boundless overflow
homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream
homer boundless and resistless as achilles bears all before him and shines more and more as the tumult increases virgil calmly daring like ćneas appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity
and when we look upon their machines homer seems like his own jupiter in his terror shaking olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heaven
virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the god laying plans for empires and regularly ordering his whole creation
but after all it is with great part as with great virtues they naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins
as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness
if we look upon homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty
among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon which so much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of probability
perhaps it may be with great and superior soul as with gigantic body which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of part to become miracles in the whole and like the old hero of that make commit something near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances
thus homer has his speaking horse and virgil his myrtles distilling blood where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability
when we behold their battle methinks the two poet resemble the hero they celebrate it is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances
the force of this faculty is seen in nothing more than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one
his similes are like pictures where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects
the same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images
if there are other which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the time he lived in
such are his grosser representations of the god and the vicious and imperfect manner of his hero but i must here speak a word of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by the censurers and defenders of homer
it must be a strange partiality to antiquity to think with madame dacier that those time and manner are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours
who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those age when a spirit of revenge and cruelty joined with the practice of rapine and robbery reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest prince were put to the sword and their wife and daughter made slaves and concubines
on the other side i would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the hero of homer engaged
there is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding age in beholding monarch without their guards prince tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the spring
when we read homer we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in the perusal of him
let them think they are growing acquainted with nation and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand year back into the remotest antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found the only true mirror of that ancient world
the reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind by this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their dislike will become a satisfaction
this consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his god and hero such as the far darting phoebus the blue eyed pallas the swift footed achilles which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated
those of the god depended upon the power and offices then believed to belong to them and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rite and solemn devotions in which they were used they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions and which it was an irreverence to omit
boileau is of opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such for the greeks having no name derived from their father were obliged to add some other distinction of each person either naming his parent expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as alexander the son of philip herodotus of halicarnassus diogenes the cynic
as for the epithets of great man mons homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry
and indeed we have something parallel to these in modern time such as the name of harold harefoot edmund ironside edward longshanks edward the black prince
if yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition i shall add a further conjecture
hesiod dividing the world into its different age has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one of hero distinct from other man a divine race who fought at thebes and troy are called demi god and live by the care of jupiter in the islands of the blessed
now among the divine honour which were paid them they might have this also in common with the god not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families actions or qualities
what other cavils have been raised against homer are such as hardly deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work
many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt virgil which is much the same as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as heard of homer having written first a consideration which whoever compares these two poet ought to have always in his eye
some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the fable and moral of the ćneis to those of the iliad for the same reasons which might set the odyssey above the ćneis as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed as because achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as ćneas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character it is thus that rapin judges in his comparison of homer and virgil
other select those particular passage of homer which are not so laboured as some that virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of scaliger in his poetics
other quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement oftener from an ignorance of the grace of the original and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of perrault in his parallels
lastly there are other who pretending to a fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of homer and that of his work but when they come to assign the cause of the great reputation of the iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his time and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the city
the same might as well be said of virgil or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation
to be the cause of his fame which were in reality the consequences of his merit this is the method of mons
who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age homer had lived he must have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him
in all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself remains unequalled by his followers he still continues superior to them
a cooler judgment may commit fewer faults and be more approved in the eye of one sort of critics but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment
homer not only appears the inventor of poetry but excels all the inventors of other art in this that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him
he showed all the stretch of fancy at once and if he has failed in some of his flight it was but because he attempted everything
a work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit nature and art conspire to raise it pleasure and profit join to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance
having now spoken of the beauty and defects of the original it remains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief characteristic
as far as that is seen in the main part of the poem such as the fable manner and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions
as it also breaks out in every particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief character
it is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed and for the rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since these must be his own but the other he is to take as he finds them
it should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the grace of these in the greek
it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manner of expression
if there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal
i know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and i will venture to say there have not been more man misled in former time by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author
it is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place
it is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps
where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic
nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime other sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity
i see these different followers of homer some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain signs of false mettle other slowly and servilely creeping in his train while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them
however of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his friend must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world will call dulness
there is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bold and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dressed at all
de la mott what he has done admitted no increase it only left room for contraction or regulation methinks simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity
this pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the scripture and our author one may affirm with all respect to the inspired writings that the divine spirit made use of no other word
but what were intelligible and common to man at that time and in that part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred book than that of any other writer
this consideration together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thought may methinks induce a translator on the one hand to give in to several of those general phrases and manner of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the old testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the divinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion
for a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet
they have something venerable and as i may say oracular in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase
perhaps the mixture of some graecisms and old word after the manner of milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast
but certainly the use of modern terms of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like into which some of his translators have fallen cannot be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language
there are two peculiarities in homer diction which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who are seemed pleased with them as beauty
i speak of his compound epithets and of his repetitions many of the former cannot be done literally into english without destroying the purity of our language
i believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an english compound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poet and are become familiar through their use of them such as the cloud compelling which_jove
as for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one the course to be taken is obvious
some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two word may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leaf shaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountain shakes his waving wood
other that admit of different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced
for example the epithet of apollo hekaebolos or far shooting is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the dart and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such place where apollo is represented as a god in person i would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described i would make choice of the latter
upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in homer and which though it might be accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those time is by no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment
as for homer repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or hemistitch
i hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other
the repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his word as in the messages from god to man or from higher power to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemn form of prayer oaths or the like
in other cases i believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any if they be tedious the author is to answer for it
it only remains to speak of the versification homer as has been said is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new subject
this is indeed one of the most exquisite beauty of poetry and attainable by very few i only know of homer eminent for it in the greek and virgil in the latin
i am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fully possessed of his image however it may reasonably be believed they designed this in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all other
few readers have the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see i have endeavoured at this beauty
i attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done
upon the whole i must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to homer we have only those of chapman hobbes and ogilby
chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his
he has frequent interpolations of four or six line and i remember one in the thirteenth book of the odyssey ver
he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other place of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles
he appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in homer and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end
his expression is involved in fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as in the tragedy of bussy amboise
in a word the nature of the man may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in poetry
his own boast of having finished half the iliad in less than fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed
but that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived at year of discretion
hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them and often omits the most beautiful
as for its being esteemed a close translation i doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the contractions above mentioned
he sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen but through carelessness
where he has spun twenty verses out of two his poetry as well as ogilby is too mean for criticism
he has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some place not truly interpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in
he seems to have had too much regard to chapman whose word he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passage where he wanders from the original
however had he translated the whole work i would no more have attempted homer after him than virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language
but the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it
that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character in particular place where the sense can bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his number to preserve in the more active or descriptive part a warmth and elevation in the more sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fulness and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the word nor sometimes the very cast of the periods neither to omit nor confound any rite or customs of antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry
what i would further recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with virgil above all the ancients and with milton above all the moderns
next these the archbishop of cambray telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and bossu admirable treatise of the epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct
but after all with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few
it is a great loss to the poetical world that mr dryden did not live to translate the iliad those only who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning
for to satisfy such a want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that is not greek
what i have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions i am prepared to learn though i fear no judges so little as our best poet who are most sensible of the weight of this task
as for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they are unhappy man but none as they are malignant writers
i was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by persons for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to man of wit
mr addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as i cannot repeat without vanity
i was obliged to sir richard steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public dr swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend
i must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticisms of mr congreve who had led me the way in translating some part of homer
i must add the name of mr rowe and dr parnell though i shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature to give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning
the humanity and frankness of sir samuel garth are what i never knew wanting on any occasion the favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection
but what can i say of the honour so many of the great have done me while the first name of the age appear as my subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers
among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet that his grace the duke of buckingham was not displeased i should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent essay so complete a praise read homer once and you can read no more for all book else appear so mean so poor verse will seem prose but still persist to read and homer will be all the book you need
that the earl of halifax was one of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite art is more owing to his generosity or his example that such a genius as my lord bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scene of business than in all the useful and entertaining part of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that the noble author of the tragedy of heroic love has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the iliad
i cannot deny myself the pride of confessing that i have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation
i could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the earl of carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them
mr stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair
the particular zeal of mr harcourt the son of the late lord chancellor gave me a proof how much i am honoured in a share of his friendship
i must attribute to the same motive that of several other of my friend to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence and i am satisfied i can no way better oblige man of their turn than by my silence
he would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at athens that has been shown me by its learned rival the university of oxford
and i can hardly envy him those pompous honour he received after death when i reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easy friendships which make the satisfaction of life
this distinction is the more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular man
whatever the success may prove i shall never repent of an undertaking in which i have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit and in which i hope to pass some of those year of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to other nor disagreeable to myself
in short i have found more patrons than ever homer wanted the iliad book i argument the contention of achilles and agamemnon
in the war of troy the greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring town and taken from thence two beautiful captives chryseis and briseis allotted the first to agamemnon and the last to achilles
chryses the father of chryseis and priest of apollo comes to the grecian camp to ransom her with which the action of the poem opens in the tenth year of the siege
the priest being refused and insolently dismissed by agamemnon entreats for vengeance from his god who inflicts a pestilence on the greeks
achilles calls a council and encourages chalcas to declare the cause of it who attributes it to the refusal of chryseis
the king being obliged to send back his captive enters into a furious contest with achilles which wise_nestor pacifies however as he had the absolute command of the army he seizes on briseis in revenge
achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his force from the rest of the greeks and complaining to thetis she supplicates jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her son by giving victory to the trojans
jupiter granting her suit incenses juno between whom the debate runs high till they are reconciled by the address of vulcan
the time of two and twenty day is taken up in this book nine during the plague one in the council and quarrel of the prince and twelve for jupiter stay with the ćthiopians at whose return thetis prefers her petition
the scene lies in the grecian camp then changes to chrysa and lastly to olympus achilles wrath to greece the direful spring of woe unnumber heavenly goddess sing
that wrath which hurl to pluto gloomy reign the soul of mighty chief untimely slain whose limb unburied on the naked shore devouring dog and hungry vultures tore
since great achilles and atrides strove such was the sovereign doom and such the will of which_jove declare muse in what ill fated hour
sprung the fierce strife from what offended power latona son a dire contagion spread and heap the camp with mountain of the dead the king of man his reverent priest defied
and for the king offence the people died for chryses sought with costly gift to gain his captive daughter from the victor chain
suppliant the venerable father stands apollo awful ensigns grace his hand by these he begs and lowly bending down extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
he sued to all but chief implored for grace the brother king of atreus royal race ye king and warrior may your vows be
crown and troy proud wall lie level with the ground may which_jove restore you when your toil are er safe to the pleasures of your native shore
but oh relieve a wretched parent pain and give chryseis to these arm again if mercy fail yet let my presents move and dread avenging phoebus son of which_jove
not so atrides he with kingly pride repulsed the sacred sire and thus replied hence on thy life and fly these hostile plain nor ask presumptuous what the king detains
the greeks in shouts their joint assent declare the priest to reverence and release the fair hence with thy laurel crown and golden rod nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god
mine is thy daughter priest and shall remain and prayer and tear and bribes shall plead in vain till time shall rifle every youthful grace and age dismiss her from my cold embrace
in daily labour of the loom employ or doom to deck the bed she once enjoy hence then to argos shall the maid retire
far from her native soil and weeping sire illustration homer invoking the muse homer invoking the muse the trembling priest along the shore return
and in the anguish of a father mourn disconsolate not daring to complain silent he wander by the sounding main till safe at distance to his god he prays the god who dart around the world his rays
smintheus sprung from fair latona line thou guardian power of cilla the divine thou source of light whom tenedos adores and whose bright presence gilds thy chrysa shore
if er with wreaths i hung thy sacred fane or fed the flame with fat of oxen slain god of the silver bow
thy shafts employ avenge thy servant and the greeks destroy thus chryses pray the favouring power attends and from olympus lofty tops descends
bent was his bow the grecian heart to wound fierce as he moved his silver shafts resound breathing revenge a sudden night he spread and gloomy darkness roll about his head
the fleet in view he twang his deadly bow and hissing fly the feather fate below on mules and dog the infection first began
and last the vengeful arrow fix in man for nine long night through all the dusky air the pyres thick flaming shot a dismal glare
but ere the tenth revolving day was run inspired by juno thetis godlike son convened to council all the grecian train for much the goddess mourn her hero slain
the assembly seated rising er the rest achilles thus the king of man address why leave we not the fatal trojan shore and measure back the sea
we cross before the plague destroying whom the sword would spare tis time to save the few remains of war but let some prophet or some sacred sage
explore the cause of great apollo rage or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove by mystic dreams for dreams descend from which_jove
if broken vows this heavy curse have laid let altars smoke and hecatombs be paid so heaven atoned shall dying greece restore and phoebus dart his burning shafts no more
he said and sat when chalcas thus replied chalcas the wise_nestor the grecian priest and guide that sacred seer whose comprehensive view the past the present and the future knew
uprising slow the venerable sage thus spoke the prudence and the fear of age beloved of which_jove achilles would st thou know why angry phoebus bends his fatal bow
first give thy faith and plight a prince word of sure protection by thy power and sword for i must speak what wisdom would conceal and
truths invidious to the great reveal bold is the task when subjects grown too wise_nestor instruct a monarch where his error lies for though we deem the short lived fury past tis sure the mighty will revenge at last
to whom pelides from thy inmost soul speak what thou know st and speak without control en by that god i swear who rules the day to whom thy hand the vows of greece convey
and whose bless oracles thy lips declare long as achilles breathes this vital air no daring greek of all the numerous band against his priest shall lift an impious hand
encouraged thus the blameless man replies nor vows unpaid nor slighted sacrifice but he our chief provoked the raging pest apollo vengeance for his injured priest
not en the chief by whom our host are led the king of king shall touch that sacred head nor will the god awaken fury cease but plagues shall spread and funeral fire increase
till the great king without a ransom paid to her own chrysa send the black eyed maid perhaps with added sacrifice and prayer the priest may pardon and the god may spare
the prophet spoke when with a gloomy frown the monarch started from his shining throne black choler fill his breast
that boil with ire and from his eye balls flash the living fire augur accursed denouncing mischief still prophet of plagues for ever boding ill
still must that tongue some wounding message bring and still thy priestly pride provoke thy king for this are phoebus oracles explored to teach the greeks to murmur at their lord
for this with falsehood is my honour stain is heaven offended and a priest profaned because my prize my beauteous maid i hold and heavenly charm prefer to proffer gold
a maid unmatch in manner as in face skill in each art and crown with every grace not half so dear were clytaemnestra charm
yet if the god demand her let her sail our care are only for the public weal let me be deem the hateful cause of all and suffer rather than my people fall
when first her blooming beauty bless my arm the prize the beauteous prize i will resign so dearly valued and so justly mine
but since for common good i yield the fair my private loss let grateful greece repair nor unrewarded let your prince complain that he alone has fought and bled in vain
insatiate king achilles thus replies fond of the power but fonder of the prize would st thou the greeks their lawful prey should yield the due reward of many a well fought field
the spoil of city razed and warrior slain we share with justice as with toil we gain but to resume whate er thy avarice craves that trick of tyrants may be borne by slaves
yet if our chief for plunder only fight the spoil of ilion shall thy loss requite whene er by which_jove decree our conquering power shall humble to the dust her lofty tower
then thus the king shall i my prize resign with tame content and thou possess of thine great as thou art and like a god in fight think not to rob me of a soldier right
first let the just equivalent be paid such as a king might ask and let it be a treasure worthy her and worthy me
at thy demand shall i restore the maid or grant me this or with a monarch claim this hand shall seize some other captive dame

and darest thou threat to snatch my prize away due to the deed of many a dreadful day a prize as small tyrant

her thus returning from the furrow main ulysses led to phoebus sacred fane where at his solemn altar as the maid he gave to chryses thus the hero said hail reverend priest
next on the shore their hecatomb they land chryseis last descending on the strand to phoebus awful dome a suppliant

at this the sire embraced the maid again so sadly lost so lately sought in vain so chryses pray apollo heard his prayer
and now the greeks their hecatomb prepare between their horns the salted barley threw and with their head to heaven the victim slew

pours the black wine and sees the flame aspire the youth with instruments surround the fire the thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dress

repress with pure libations they conclude the feast the youth with wine the copious goblets crown and pleased dispense the flowing bowls around
with hymns divine the joyous banquet ends the paeans lengthen till the sun descends the greeks restored the grateful notes prolong apollo listens and approves the song
twas night the chief beside their vessel lie till rosy morn had purpled er the sky then launch and hoist the mast indulgent gales supplied by phoebus fill the swelling sails the milk white canvas bellying as they blow the parted ocean foams and roars below above the bounding billows swift they flew till now the grecian camp appear in view
far on the beach they haul their bark to land the crooked keel divides the yellow sand then part where stretch along the winding bay the ship and tent in mingled prospect lay

twelve day were past and now the dawning light the god had summon to the olympian height which_jove first ascending from the watery bowers leads the long order of ethereal power
but raging still amidst his navy sat the stern_hector achilles stedfast in his hate when like the morning mist in early day rose from the flood the daughter of the sea
there far apart and high above the rest the thunderer sat where old olympus shrouds his hundred head in heaven and props the cloud
and to the seat divine her flight address suppliant the goddess stood one hand she placed beneath his beard and one his knees embraced
my word could please thee or my actions aid some marks of honour on my son bestow and pay in glory what in life you owe
if er father of the god she said fame is at least by heavenly promise due to life so short and now dishonour too

to grace her fierce inexorable son perhaps in grecian blood to drench the plain and glut his vengeance with my people slain
then thus the god restless fate of pride that strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide vain is the search presumptuous and
abhorr anxious to thee and odious to thy lord let this suffice the immutable decree no force can shake what is that ought to be
goddess submit nor dare our will withstand but dread the power of this avenging hand the united strength of all the god above

thou goddess mother with our sire comply nor break the sacred union of the sky lest roused to rage he shake the bless abodes launch the red lightning and dethrone the god
thus vulcan spoke and rising with a bound the double bowl with sparkling nectar crown which held to juno in a cheerful way goddess he cried be patient and obey
dear as you are if which_jove his arm extend i can but grieve unable to defend what god so daring in your aid to move or lift his hand against the force of which_jove

the general who is deluded with the hope of taking troy without his assistance but fear the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague as well as by the length of time contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem
he first communicates his design to the prince in council that he would propose a return to the soldiers and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced
then he assembles the whole host and upon moving for a return to greece they unanimously agree to it and run to prepare the ship
the assembly is recalled several speeches made on the occasion and at length the advice of wise_nestor followed which was to make a general muster of the troop and to divide them into their several nation before they proceeded to battle
this gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the force of the greeks and trojans and in a large catalogue
they are detained by the management of ulysses who chastises the insolence of thersites the time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day

your own resistless eloquence employ and to the immortals trust the fall of troy the voice divine confess the warlike maid ulysses heard nor uninspired
thus graced attention and respect to gain he runs he fly through all the grecian train each prince of name or chief in arm approved he fired with praise or with persuasion moved
obey then meeting first atrides from his hand received the imperial sceptre of command warrior like you with strength and wisdom bless by brave examples should confirm the rest
the monarch will not yet reveal appears he tries our courage but resents our fear the unwary greeks his fury may provoke not thus the king in secret council spoke
which_jove love our chief from which_jove his honour spring beware for dreadful is the wrath of king but if a clamorous vile plebeian rose him with reproof he check or tamed with blow
be still thou slave and to thy betters yield unknown alike in council and in field ye god what dastards would our host command
swept to the war the lumber of a land be silent wretch and think not here allow that worst of tyrants an usurping crowd
to one sole monarch which_jove commits the sway his are the laws and him let all obey with word like these the troop ulysses ruled the loudest silenced and the fiercest cool
murmuring they move as when old ocean roars and heaves huge surges to the trembling shore the groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound the rock remurmur and the deeps rebound
back to the assembly roll the thronging train desert the ship and pour upon the plain at length the tumult sinks the noises cease and a still silence lulls the camp to peace
controll in scandal busy in reproaches bold with witty malice studious to defame scorn all his joy and laughter all his aim
thersites only clamour in the throng loquacious loud and turbulent of tongue awed by no shame by no respect but chief he gloried with licentious style to lash the great and monarch to revile
his figure such as might his soul proclaim one eye was blinking and one leg was lame his mountain shoulder half his breast erspread thin hair
spleen to mankind his envious heart possess and much he hated all but most the best ulysses or achilles still his theme
bestrew his long misshapen head but royal scandal his delight supreme long had he lived the scorn of every greek vex when he spoke yet still they heard him speak
sharp was his voice which in the shrillest tone thus with injurious taunts attack the throne amidst the glory of so bright a reign what moves the great atrides to complain
tis thine whate er the warrior breast inflames the golden spoil and thine the lovely dame with all the wealth our war and blood bestow thy tent are crowded and thy chests erflow
thus at full ease in heap of riches roll what grieves the monarch is it thirst of gold say shall we march with our unconquer power the greeks and i to ilion hostile tower
and bring the race of royal bastards here for troy to ransom at a price too dear but safer plunder thy own host supplies say wouldst thou seize some valiant leader prize
or if thy heart to generous love be led some captive fair to bless thy kingly bed whate er our master craves submit we must plagued with his pride or punish for his lust
oh women of achaia man no more hence let us fly and let him waste his store in love and pleasures on the phrygian shore
we may be wanted on some busy day when stern_hector comes so great achilles may from him he forced the prize we jointly gave from him the fierce the fearless and the brave
and durst he as he ought resent that wrong this mighty tyrant were no tyrant long fierce from his seat at this ulysses spring
with indignation sparkling in his eye he view the wretch and sternly thus replies peace factious monster born to vex the state with wrangling talents form for foul debate curb that impetuous tongue nor rashly vain and singly mad asperse the sovereign reign
in generous vengeance of the king of king have we not known thee slave of all our host the man who acts the least upbraids the most
think not the greeks to shameful flight to bring nor let those lips profane the name of king for our return we trust the heavenly power be that their care to fight like man be ours
but grant the host with wealth the general load except detraction what hast thou bestow suppose some hero should his spoil resign art thou that hero could those spoil be thine
if on thy next offence this hand forbear to strip those arm thou ill deserv st to wear expel the council where our prince meet and send thee scourged and howling through the fleet
god let me perish on this hateful shore and let these eye behold my son no more he said and cowering as the dastard bends the weighty sceptre on his bank descends
the tear spring starting from his haggard eye trembling he sat and shrunk in abject fear from his vile visage wiped the scalding tear while to his neighbour each
on the round bunch the bloody tumours rise express his thought ye god what wonders has ulysses wrought what fruits his conduct and his courage yield
generous he rises in the crown defence to curb the factious tongue of insolence such just examples on offenders shown sedition silence and assert the throne
great in the council glorious in the field twas thus the general voice the hero praised who rising high the imperial sceptre raised
the blue eyed pallas his celestial friend in form a herald bade the crowds attend the expecting crowds in still attention hung to hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue
then deeply thoughtful pausing ere he spoke his silence thus the prudent hero broke unhappy monarch whom the grecian race with shame deserting heap with vile disgrace
once all their voice but ah forgotten now ne er to return was then the common cry till troy proud structures should in ashes lie
not such at argos was their generous vow behold them weeping for their native shore what could their wife or helpless children more
few leagues removed we wish our peaceful seat when the ship tosses and the tempests beat then well may this long stay provoke their tear the tedious length of nine revolving year
what heart but melts to leave the tender train and one short month endure the wintry main not for their grief the grecian host i blame but vanquish
baffled oh eternal shame expect the time to troy destruction given and try the faith of chalcas and of heaven what pass at aulis greece can witness bear
beside a fountain sacred brink we raised our verdant altars and the victim blazed twas where the plane tree spread its shade around the altars heaved and from the crumbling ground
and all who live to breathe this phrygian air a mighty dragon shot of dire portent from which_jove himself the dreadful sign was sent
the topmost branch a mother bird possess eight callow infant fill the mossy nest herself the ninth the serpent as he hung stretch his black jaws and crush the crying young while hovering near with miserable moan
straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll and curl around in many a winding fold the drooping mother wail d
the mother last as round the nest she flew seized by the beating wing the monster slew nor long survived to marble turn he stands a lasting prodigy on aulis sands
her children gone such was the will of which_jove and hence we dare trust in his omen and support the war
for while around we gazed with wondering eye and trembling sought the power with sacrifice full of his god the reverend chalcas cried
as many birds as by the snake were slain so many year the toil of greece remain but wait the tenth for ilion fall decreed thus spoke the prophet thus the fate succeed
ye grecian warrior lay your fear aside this wondrous signal which_jove himself displays of long long labour but eternal praise obey ye grecians
with submission wait nor let your flight avert the trojan fate he said the shore with loud applauses sound the hollow ship each deafening shout rebound
then wise_nestor thus these vain debates forbear ye talk like children not like hero dare where now are all your high resolves at last
your leagues concluded your engagements past vow with libations and with victim then now vanish like their smoke the faith of man
while useless word consume the unactive hour no wonder troy so long resists our power rise great atrides and with courage sway we march to war if thou direct the way
but leave the few that dare resist thy laws the mean deserters of the grecian cause to grudge the conquest mighty which_jove prepares and view with envy our successful war
on that great day when first the martial train big with the fate of ilion plough the main which_jove on the right a prosperous signal sent and thunder rolling shook the firmament
encouraged hence maintain the glorious strife till every soldier grasp a phrygian wife till argive_helen woe at full revenged appear and troy proud matrons render tear for tear
before that day if any greek invite his country troop to base inglorious flight stand forth that greek and hoist his sail to fly and die the dastard first who dreads to die
among those counsel let not mine be vain in tribes and nation to divide thy train his separate troop let every leader call each strengthen each and all encourage all
what chief or soldier of the numerous band or bravely fight or ill obeys command when thus distinct they war shall soon be known
but now monarch all thy chief advise nor what they offer thou thyself despise and what the cause of ilion not erthrown
if fate resists or if our arm are slow if god above prevent or man below to him the king how much thy year excel in art of counsel and in speaking well
but ten such sages as they grant in thee such wisdom soon should priam force destroy and soon should fall the haughty tower of troy
but which_jove forbids who plunges those he hates in fierce contention and in vain debates now great achilles from our aid withdraws by me provoked a captive maid the cause
o would the god in love to greece decree if er as friend we join the trojan wall must shake and heavy will the vengeance fall
his sharpen spear let every grecian wield and every grecian fix his brazen shield let all excite the fiery steed of war and all for combat fit the rattling car
this day this dreadful day let each contend no rest no respite till the shade descend till darkness or till death shall cover all let the war bleed and let the mighty fall till bathed in sweat be every manly breast with the huge shield each brawny arm depress each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw and each spent courser at the chariot blow
who dares inglorious in his ship to stay who dares to tremble on this signal day that wretch too mean to fall by martial power the birds shall mangle and the dog devour
but now ye warrior take a short repast and well refresh to bloody conflict haste the monarch spoke and straight a murmur rose loud as the surges when the tempest blow
the troop dispersing bend the fire are kindled and the smokes ascend with hasty feasts they sacrifice and pray to avert the danger of the doubtful day

unbounded and alone hear be priam palace sunk in grecian fire in stern_hector breast be plunged this shining sword and slaughter hero groan around their lord
thus prayed the chief his unavailing prayer great which_jove refused and toss in empty air the god averse while yet the fumes arose prepared new toil and doubled woe on woe
their prayer perform the chief the rite pursue the barley sprinkled and the victim slew the limb they sever from the inclosing hide the thighs selected to the god divide
on these in double cauls involved with art the choicest morsels lie from every part from the cleft wood the crackling flame aspire while the fat victim feed the sacred fire
the thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dress the assistants part transfix and roast the rest then spread the tables the repast prepare each takes his seat and each receives his share
now bid thy herald sound the loud alarm and call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arm now seize the occasion now the troop survey and lead to war when heaven directs the way

thus from his flaggy wing when notus sheds a night of vapours round the mountain head swift gliding mists the dusky field invade to thieves more grateful than the midnight shade
while scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey lost and confused amidst the thicken day so wrapp in gathering dust the grecian train a moving cloud swept on and hid the plain
now front to front the hostile army stand eager of fight and only wait command when to the van before the son of fame whom troy sent forth the beauteous paris came
his bended bow across his shoulder flung his sword beside him negligently hung two pointed spear he shook with gallant grace and dared the bravest of the grecian race
as thus with glorious air and proud disdain he boldly stalk the foremost on the plain him great_menelaus loved of mars espies with heart elated and with joyful eye
so joy a lion if the branching deer or mountain goat his bulky prize appear eager he seizes and devours the slain press by bold youth and baying dog in vain
thus fond of vengeance with a furious bound in clanging arm he leaps upon the ground from his high chariot him approaching near
the beauteous champion view with marks of fear smit with a conscious sense retires behind and shuns the fate he well deserved to find
as when some shepherd from the rustling trees shot forth to view a scaly serpent sees trembling and pale he starts with wild affright
in form a god the panther speckled hide flow o er his armour with an easy pride and all confused precipitates his flight
so from the king the shining warrior fly and plunged amid the thickest trojans lies as godlike stern_hector sees the prince retreat he thus upbraids him with a generous heat unhappy paris
but to women brave so fairly form and only to deceive oh hadst thou died when first thou saw st the light or died at least before thy nuptial rite
a better fate than vainly thus to boast and fly the scandal of thy trojan host god how the scornful greeks exult to see their fear of danger undeceived in thee
in former day in all thy gallant pride when thy tall ship triumphant stemm the tide when greece beheld thy painted canvas flow and crowds stood wondering at the passing show say was it thus with such a baffled mien you met the approaches of the spartan queen thus from her realm
thy figure promised with a martial air but ill thy soul supplies a form so fair convey the beauteous prize and both her warlike lord outshined in argive_helen eye
this deed thy foe delight thy own disgrace thy father grief and ruin of thy race this deed recalls thee to the proffer fight or hast thou injured
whom thou dar st not right soon to thy cost the field would make thee know thou keep st the consort of a braver foe
thy graceful form instilling soft desire thy curling tresses and thy silver lyre beauty and youth in vain to these you trust when youth and beauty shall be laid in dust troy yet may wake and one avenging blow crush the dire author of his country woe
tis just my brother what your anger speaks but who like thee can boast a soul sedate so firmly proof to all the shocks of fate
thy force like steel a temper hardness shows still edged to wound and still untired with blow like steel uplifted by some strenuous swain with falling wood to strew the wasted plain
thy gift i praise nor thou despise the charm with which a lover golden venus arm soft moving speech and pleasing outward show no wish can gain them but the god bestow
yet would st thou have the proffer combat stand the greeks and trojans seat on either hand then let a midway space our host divide
and on that stage of war the cause be tried by paris there the spartan king be fought for beauteous argive_helen and the wealth she brought and who his rival can in arm subdue his be the fair and his the treasure too
his silence here with blushes paris breaks thus with a lasting league your toil may cease and troy possess her fertile field in peace
the challenge stern_hector heard with joy then with his spear restrain the youth of troy held by the midst athwart and near the foe advanced with steps majestically slow while round his dauntless head the grecians pour their stone and arrow in a mingled shower
thus may the greeks review their native shore much famed for generous steed for beauty more he said then thus the monarch great atrides cried forbear ye warrior lay the dart aside
a parley stern_hector asks a message bears we know him by the various plume he wears awed by his high command the greeks attend the tumult silence and the fight suspend
while from the centre stern_hector rolls his eye on either host and thus to both applies hear all ye trojan all ye grecian band what paris author of the war demands
here in the midst in either army sight he dares the spartan king to single fight and wills that argive_helen and the ravish spoil that caused the contest shall reward the toil
your shining sword within the sheath restrain and pitch your lance in the yielding plain let these the brave triumphant victor grace and different nation part in leagues of peace
he spoke in still suspense on either side each army stood the spartan chief replied me too ye warrior hear whose fatal right
a world engages in the toil of fight to me the labour of the field resign me paris injured all the war be mine
fall he that must beneath his rival arm and live the rest secure of future harms two lambs devoted by your country rite
to earth a sable to the sun a white prepare ye trojans while a third we bring select to which_jove the inviolable king
let reverend priam in the truce engage and add the sanction of considerate age his son are faithless headlong in debate and youth itself an empty wavering state cool age advances venerably wise_nestor
turns on all hand its deep discerning eye sees what befell and what may yet befall concludes from both and best provides for all
the nation hear with rising hope possess and peaceful prospects dawn in every breast within the line they drew their steed around
and from their chariot issued on the ground next all unbuckling the rich mail they wore laid their bright arm along the sable shore
on either side the meeting host are seen with lance fix and close the space between two herald now despatch to troy invite the phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite
meantime to beauteous argive_helen from the sky the various goddess of the rainbow fly like fair laodice in form and face the loveliest nymph of priam royal race her in the palace at her loom she found the golden web her own sad story crown the trojan war she weaved herself the prize and the dire triumphs of her fatal eye
talthybius hastens to the fleet to bring the lamb for which_jove the inviolable king to whom the goddess of the painted bow approach and view the wondrous scene below
each hardy greek and valiant trojan knight so dreadful late and furious for the fight now rest their spear or lean upon their shield ceased is the war and silent all the field
paris alone and sparta king advance in single fight to toss the beamy lance each met in arm the fate of combat tries thy love the motive and thy charm the prize
this said the many coloured maid inspires her husband love and wakes her former fire her country parent all that once were dear rush to her thought and force a tender tear er her fair face a snowy veil she threw
and softly sighing from the loom withdrew her handmaids clymene and ćthra wait her silent footsteps to the scaean gate
the king the first thymoetes at his side lampus and clytius long in council tried panthus and hicetaon once the strong and next the wisest of the reverend throng antenor grave and sage ucalegon lean on the wall and bask before the sun
chief who no more in bloody fight engage but wise_nestor through time and narrative with age in summer day like grasshoppers rejoice a bloodless race that send a feeble voice
there sat the seniors of the trojan race old priam chief and most in priam grace these when the spartan queen approach the tower
in secret own resistless beauty power they cried no wonder such celestial charm for nine long year have set the world in arm what winning grace
what majestic mien she moves a goddess and she looks a queen yet hence heaven convey that fatal face and from destruction save the trojan race
the good old priam welcomed her and cried approach my child and grace thy father side see on the plain thy grecian spouse appears the friend and kindred of thy former year
no crime of thine our present sufferings draws not thou but heaven disposing will the cause the god these army and this force employ the hostile god conspire the fate of troy
but lift thy eye and say what greek is he far as from hence these aged orbs can see around whose brow such martial grace shine so tall so awful and almost divine
though some of larger stature tread the green none match his grandeur and exalted mien he seems a monarch and his country pride
thus ceased the king and thus the fair replied before thy presence father i appear with conscious shame and reverential fear
ah had i died ere to these walk i fled false to my country and my nuptial bed my brother friend and daughter left behind false to them all to paris only kind
for this i mourn till grief or dire disease shall waste the form whose fault it was to please the king of king atrides you survey great in the war and great in art of sway
my brother once before my day of shame and oh that still he bore a brother name with wonder priam view the godlike man extoll the happy prince and thus began
bless atrides born to prosperous fate successful monarch of a mighty state how vast thy empire of your matchless train what number lost what number yet remain
in ancient time when otreus fill the throne when godlike mygdon led their troop of horse and i to join them raised the trojan force against the manlike amazons we stood
in phrygia once were gallant army known and sangar stream ran purple with their blood but far inferior those in martial grace and strength of number to this grecian race
this said once more he view the warrior train what he whose arm lie scatter on the plain broad is his breast his shoulder larger spread though great atrides overtops his head
nor yet appear his care and conduct small from rank to rank he moves and order all the stately ram thus measures er the ground and master of the flock surveys them round
then argive_helen thus whom your discerning eye have singled out is ithacus the wise_nestor a barren island boasts his glorious birth his fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth
when trusting which_jove and hospitable laws to troy he came to plead the grecian cause great_menelaus urged the same request
my house was honour with each royal guest i knew their persons and admired their part both brave in arm and both approved in art
antenor took the word and thus began myself king have seen that wondrous man erect the spartan most engaged our view ulysses seated greater reverence drew
when atreus son harangued the listening train just was his sense and his expression plain his word succinct yet full without a fault he spoke no more than just the thing he ought
his modest eye he fix upon the ground as one unskill or dumb he seem to stand nor raised his head nor stretch his sceptred hand
but when ulysses rose in thought profound but when he speaks what elocution flows soft as the fleeces of descending snows
the copious accents fall with easy art melting they fall and sink into the heart wondering we hear and fix in deep surprise our ear refute the censure of our eye
what chief is that with giant strength endued whose brawny shoulder and whose swelling chest and lofty stature far exceed the rest
the king then ask as yet the camp he view oilean_ajax the great the beauteous queen replied himself a host the grecian strength and pride
see bold idomeneus superior tower amid yon circle of his cretan power great as a god i saw him once before with great_menelaus on the spartan shore
yet two are wanting of the numerous train whom long my eye have sought but sought in vain castor and pollux first in martial force one bold on foot and one renown for horse
the rest i know and could in order name all valiant chief and man of mighty fame my brother these the same our native shore one house contain us as one mother bore
perhaps the chief from warlike toil at ease for distant troy refused to sail the sea perhaps their sword some nobler quarrel draws
so spoke the fair nor knew her brother doom wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb adorn with honour in their native shore silent they slept and heard of war no more
ashamed to combat in their sister cause meantime the herald through the crowded town bring the rich wine and destined victim down
idaeus arm the golden goblets press who thus the venerable king address arise father of the trojan state the nation call thy joyful people wait to seal the truce and end the dire debate
paris thy son and sparta king advance in measured lists to toss the weighty lance and who his rival shall in arm subdue his be the dame and his the treasure too
thus with a lasting league our toil may cease and troy possess her fertile field in peace so shall the greeks review their native shore
with grief he heard and bade the chief prepare to join his milk white courser to the car he mounts the seat antenor at his side the gentle steed through scaea gate they guide
much famed for generous steed for beauty more next from the car descending on the plain amid the grecian host and trojan train slow they proceed
on either side a sacred herald stands the wine they mix and on each monarch hand pour the full urn then draws the grecian lord his cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword from the sign victim crops the curling hair
the herald part it and the prince share then loudly thus before the attentive band he calls the god and spreads his lifted hand first and greatest power whom all obey who high on ida holy mountain sway eternal which_jove
the sage ulysses then arose and with him rose the king of man and you bright orb that roll from east to west and view from pole to pole
thou mother earth and all ye living flood infernal fury and tartarean god who rule the dead and horrid woe prepare for perjured king and all who falsely swear
if by paris slain great_menelaus press the fatal plain the dame and treasures let the trojan keep and greece returning plough the watery deep
hear and be witness if by my brother lance the trojan bleed be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed the appointed fine let ilion justly pay
and every age record the signal day this if the phrygians shall refuse to yield arm must revenge and mars decide the field
with that the chief the tender victim slew and in the dust their bleeding body threw the vital spirit issued at the wound and left the members quivering on the ground
from the same urn they drink the mingled wine and add libations to the power divine while thus their prayer united mount the sky hear mighty which_jove
and may their blood who first the league confound shed like this wine disdain the thirsty ground may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust and all their lust be scatter as the dust
and hear ye god on high thus either host their imprecations join which_jove refused and mingled with the wind the rite now finish reverend priam rose and thus express a heart ercharged with woe
ye greeks and trojans let the chief engage but spare the weakness of my feeble age in yonder wall that object let me shun nor view the danger of so dear a son
whose arm shall conquer and what prince shall fall heaven only knows for heaven disposes all this said the hoary king no longer stay
but on his car the slaughter victim laid then seized the rein his gentle steed to guide and drove to troy antenor at his side
bold stern_hector and ulysses now dispose the lists of combat and the ground inclose next to decide by sacred lots prepare who first shall launch his pointed spear in air
the people pray with elevated hand and word like these are heard through all the band immortal which_jove high heaven superior lord on lofty ida holy mount adored
whoe er involved us in this dire debate give that author of the war to fate and shade eternal let division cease and joyful nation join in leagues of peace
with eye averted stern_hector hastes to turn the lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn then paris thine leap forth by fatal chance ordain the first to whirl the weighty lance
both army sat the combat to survey beside each chief his azure armour lay and round the lists the generous courser neigh
with flowers adorn with silver buckles bound lycaon corslet his fair body dress braced in and fitted to his softer breast a radiant baldric er his shoulder tied sustain the sword that glitter at his side his youthful face a polish helm erspread the waving horse hair nodded on his head
the beauteous warrior now arrays for fight in gilded arm magnificently bright the purple cuishes clasp his thighs around his figured shield a shining orb he takes
and in his hand a pointed javelin shakes with equal speed and fired by equal charm the spartan hero sheathes his limb in arm
now round the lists the admiring army stand with javelin fix the greek and trojan band amidst the dreadful vale the chief advance all pale with rage and shake the threatening lance
full on atrides ringing shield it flew nor pierced the brazen orb but with a bound leap from the buckler blunted on the ground
the trojan first his shining javelin threw atrides then his massy lance prepares in act to throw but first prefers his prayer give me great which_jove
to punish lawless lust and lay the trojan gasping in the dust destroy the aggressor aid my righteous cause avenge the breach of hospitable laws
be said and poised in air the javelin sent through paris shield the forceful weapon went his corslet pierces and his garment rends and glancing downward near his flank descends
let this example future time reclaim and guard from wrong fair friendship holy name the wary trojan bending from the blow eludes the death and disappoints his foe
but fierce atrides waved his sword and strook full on his casque the crested helmet shook the brittle steel unfaithful to his hand broke short the fragments glitter on the sand
the raging warrior to the spacious sky raised his upbraiding voice and angry eye then is it vain in which_jove himself to trust
and is it thus the god assist the just when crimes provoke us heaven success denies the dart fall harmless and the falchion fly
furious he said and towards the grecian crew seized by the crest the unhappy warrior drew struggling he followed while the embroider thong that tied his helmet dragg the chief along
then had his ruin crown atrides joy but venus trembled for the prince of troy unseen she came and burst the golden band and left an empty helmet in his hand
the casque enraged amidst the greeks he threw the greeks with smiles the polish trophy view then as once more he lifts the deadly dart
in thirst of vengeance at his rival heart the queen of love her favour champion shrouds for god can all things in a veil of cloud
raised from the field the panting youth she led and gently laid him on the bridal bed with pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews
meantime the brightest of the female kind the matchless argive_helen er the wall reclined to her beset with trojan beauty came
and all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews in borrow form the laughter loving dame she seem an ancient maid well skill to cull the snowy fleece and wind the twisted wool
the goddess softly shook her silken vest that shed perfumes and whispering thus address illustration venus disguised inviting argive_helen to the chamber of paris
safe from the fight in yonder lofty wall fair as a god with odours round him spread he lies and waits thee on the well known bed not like a warrior parted from the foe but some gay dancer in the public show
venus disguised inviting argive_helen to the chamber of paris haste happy nymph for thee thy paris calls she spoke and argive_helen secret soul was moved she scorn the champion but the man she loved
fair venus neck her eye that sparkled fire and breast reveal the queen of soft desire struck with her presence straight the lively red forsook her cheek and trembling thus she said then is it still thy pleasure to deceive
and woman frailty always to believe say to new nation must i cross the main or carry war to some soft asian plain
for whom must argive_helen break her second vow what other paris is thy darling now left to atrides victor in the strife
an odious conquest and a captive wife hence let me sail and if thy paris bear my absence ill let venus ease his care
a handmaid goddess at his side to wait renounce the glory of thy heavenly state be fix for ever to the trojan shore his spouse or slave and mount the sky no more
for me to lawless love no longer led i scorn the coward and detest his bed else should i merit everlasting shame and keen reproach from every phrygian dame
ill suits it now the joy of love to know too deep my anguish and too wild my woe illustration venus presenting argive_helen to paris
obey the power from whom thy glory rise should venus leave thee every charm must fly fade from thy cheek and languish in thy eye
cease to provoke me lest i make thee more the world aversion than their love before now the bright prize for which mankind engage than the sad victim of the public rage
at this the fairest of her sex obey and veil her blushes in a silken shade unseen and silent from the train she moves led by the goddess of the smiles and love
venus presenting argive_helen to paris then thus incensed the paphian queen replies arrived and enter at the palace gate the maid officious round their mistress wait
then all dispersing various tasks attend the queen and goddess to the prince ascend full in her paris sight the queen of love had placed the beauteous progeny of which_jove where as he view d
her charm she turn away her glowing eye and thus began to say is this the chief who lost to sense of shame late fled the field and yet survives his fame
o hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword of that brave man whom once i call my lord the boaster paris oft desired the day
with sparta king to meet in single fray go now once more thy rival rage excite provoke atrides and renew the fight
the prince replies ah cease divinely fair nor add reproaches to the wound i bear this day the foe prevail by pallas power we yet may vanquish in a happier hour there want not god to favour us above but let the business of our life be love these softer moments let delights employ and kind embraces snatch the hasty joy
yet argive_helen bids thee stay lest thou unskill shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field not thus i loved thee when from sparta shore
my forced my willing heavenly prize i bore when first entranced in cranae isle i lay mix with thy soul and all dissolved away
thus having spoke the enamour phrygian boy rush to the bed impatient for the joy him argive_helen follow slow with bashful charm
while these to love delicious rapture yield the stern_hector atrides rage round the field so some fell lion whom the wood obey roars through the desert and demands his prey
and clasp the blooming hero in her arm paris he seeks impatient to destroy but seeks in vain along the troop of troy
even those had yielded to a foe so brave the recreant warrior hateful as the grave then speaking thus the king of king arose ye trojans dardans all our generous foe
hear and attest from heaven with conquest crown our brother arm the just success have found be therefore now the spartan wealth restor d
let argive_helen own her lawful lord the appointed fine let ilion justly pay and age to age record this signal day
he ceased his army loud applauses rise and the long shout runs echoing through the sky illustration venus venus illustration map titled graeciae antiquae
the god deliberate in council concerning the trojan war they agree upon the continuation of it and jupiter sends down minerva to break the truce
map titled graeciae antiquae book iv argument the breach of the truce and the first battle she persuades pandarus to aim an arrow at great_menelaus who is wounded but cured by machaon
agamemnon is distinguished in all the part of a good general he reviews the troop and exhorts the leader some by praise and other by reproof
in the meantime some of the trojan troop attack the greeks wise_nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline the battle joins and great number are slain on both side
the same day continues through this as through the last book as it does also through the two following and almost to the end of the seventh book
and now olympus shining gate unfold the god with which_jove assume their throne of gold immortal hebe fresh with bloom divine the golden goblet crowns with purple wine while the full bowls flow round the power employ their careful eye on long contended troy
when which_jove disposed to tempt saturnia spleen thus waked the fury of his partial queen two power divine the son of atreus aid imperial juno and the martial maid
the scene is wholly in the field before troy but high in heaven they sit and gaze from far the tame spectators of his deed of war
not thus fair venus helps her favour knight the queen of pleasures shares the toil of fight each danger wards and constant in her care saves in the moment of the last despair
her act has rescued paris forfeit life though great atrides gain the glorious strife then say ye power what signal issue waits
to crown this deed and finish all the fate shall heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare or rouse the fury and awake the war
yet would the god for human good provide atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride still priam wall in peaceful honour grow and through his gate the crowding nation flow
thus while he spoke the queen of heaven enraged and queen of war in close consult engaged apart they sit their deep designs employ and meditate the future woe of troy
minerva breast the prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress but juno impotent of passion broke her sullen silence and with fury spoke
though secret anger swell illustration the council of the god the council of the god shall then tyrant of the ethereal reign
my schemes my labour and my hope be vain have i for this shook ilion with alarm assembled nation set two world in arm
to spread the war i flew from shore to shore the immortal courser scarce the labour bore at length ripe vengeance er their head impends but which_jove himself the faithless race defends
loth as thou art to punish lawless lust not all the god are partial and unjust the sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy sky sighs from his inmost soul and thus replies
oh lasting rancour oh insatiate hate to phrygia monarch and the phrygian state what high offence has fired the wife of which_jove
can wretched mortal harm the power above that troy and troy whole race thou wouldst confound and yon fair structures level with the ground
haste leave the sky fulfil thy stern_hector desire burst all her gate and wrap her wall in fire let priam bleed
if yet you thirst for more bleed all his son and ilion float with gore to boundless vengeance the wide realm be given
till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven so let it be and which_jove his peace enjoy when heaven no longer hears the name of troy
on thy loved realm whose guilt demands their fate presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay remember troy and give the vengeance way
for know of all the numerous town that rise beneath the rolling sun and starry sky which god have raised or earth born man enjoy none stands so dear to which_jove as sacred troy
but should this arm prepare to wreak our hate no mortal merit more distinguish grace than godlike priam or than priam race
at this the goddess rolled her radiant eye then on the thunderer fix them and replies three town are juno on the grecian plain more dear than all the extended earth contains mycenae argos and the spartan wall
still to our name their hecatombs expire and altars blaze with unextinguish fire these thou mayst raze nor i forbid their fall tis not in me the vengeance to remove
the crime sufficient that they share my love of power superior why should i complain resent i may but must resent in vain
yet some distinction juno might require sprung with thyself from one celestial sire a goddess born to share the realm above and styled the consort of the thundering which_jove nor thou a wife and sister s
let both consent and both by terms comply so shall the god our joint decrees obey and heaven shall act as we direct the way
see ready pallas waits thy high command to raise in arm the greek and phrygian band their sudden friendship by her art may cease
the advice approved and bade minerva fly dissolve the league and all her art employ to make the breach the faithless act of troy
right deny and the proud trojans first infringe the peace the sire of man and monarch of the sky fired with the charge she headlong urged her flight and shot like lightning from olympus height
as the red comet from saturnius sent to fright the nation with a dire portent a fatal sign to army on the plain or trembling sailors on the wintry main with sweeping glory glides along in air and shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair
between both army thus in open sight shot the bright goddess in a trail of light with eye erect the gazing host admire the power descending and the heaven on fire
the god they cried the god this signal sent and fate now labour with some vast event which_jove seals the league or bloodier scene prepares
which_jove the great arbiter of peace and war they said while pallas through the trojan throng in shape a mortal pass disguised along
like bold laodocus her course she bent who from antenor traced his high descent amidst the rank lycaon son she found
the warlike pandarus for strength renown whose squadrons led from black ćsepus flood with flaming shield in martial circle stood to him the goddess phrygian
canst thou hear a well timed counsel with a willing ear what praise were thine couldst thou direct thy dart amidst his triumph to the spartan heart
what gift from troy from paris wouldst thou gain thy country foe the grecian glory slain then seize the occasion dare the mighty deed aim at his breast and may that aim succeed
but first to speed the shaft address thy vow to lycian phoebus with the silver bow and swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay on zelia altars to the god of day
he heard and madly at the motion pleased his polish bow with hasty rashness seized twas form of horn and smooth with artful toil
who pierced long since beneath his arrow bled the stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead and sixteen palms his brow large honour spread the workmen join and shaped the bended horns and beaten gold each taper point adorns
this by the greeks unseen the warrior bends screen by the shield of his surrounding friend there meditates the mark and couching low fits the sharp arrow to the well strung bow
one from a hundred feather death he chose fated to wound and cause of future woe then offers vows with hecatombs to crown apollo altars in his native town
now with full force the yielding horn he bends drawn to an arch and joins the doubling ends close to his breast he strains the nerve below
till the barb point approach the circling bow the impatient weapon whizzes on the wing sound the tough horn and twangs the quivering string
a mountain goat resign the shining spoil but thee atrides in that dangerous hour the god forget not nor thy guardian power pallas assists and weakened in its force
diverts the weapon from its destined course so from her babe when slumber seals his eye the watchful mother wafts the envenom fly
the shaft which hissing from above pass the broad belt and through the corslet drove the folds it pierced the plaited linen tore
just where his belt with golden buckles join where linen folds the double corslet lined she turn and razed the skin and drew the purple gore
as when some stately trappings are decreed to grace a monarch on his bounding steed a nymph in caria or maeonia bred stains the pure ivory with a lively red with equal lustre various colours vie the shining whiteness and the tyrian dye so great atrides
with horror seized the king of man descried the shaft infix and saw the gushing tide nor less the spartan fear before he found the shining barb appear above the wound then with a sigh that heaved his manly breast
the royal brother thus his grief express and grasp his hand while all the greeks around with answering sighs return the plaintive sound
show thy sacred blood as down thy snowy thigh distill the streaming flood oh dear as life did i for this agree the solemn truce a fatal truce to thee
wert thou exposed to all the hostile train to fight for greece and conquer to be slain the race of trojans in thy ruin join and faith is scorn by all the perjured line
those hand we plighted and those oaths we swore shall all be vain when heaven revenge is slow which_jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow
the day shall come that great avenging day when troy proud glory in the dust shall lay when priam power and priam self shall fall and one prodigious ruin swallow all
not thus our vows confirm with wine and gore i see the god already from the pole bare his red arm and bid the thunder roll
i see the eternal all his fury shed and shake his aegis er their guilty head such mighty woe on perjured prince wait
but thou alas deserv st a happier fate still must i mourn the period of thy day and only mourn without my share of praise
deprived of thee the heartless greeks no more shall dream of conquest on the hostile shore troy seized of argive_helen and our glory lost thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast while some proud trojan thus insulting cry and spurns the dust where great_menelaus lies
such are the trophies greece from ilion brings and such the conquest of her king of king lo his proud vessel
scatter o er the main and unrevenged his mighty brother slain oh ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame erwhelm me earth and hide a monarch shame
he said a leader and a brother fear possess his soul which thus the spartan cheers let not thy word the warmth of greece abate the feeble dart is guiltless of my fate stiff with the rich embroider work around my varied belt repell the flying wound
to whom the king my brother and my friend thus always thus may heaven thy life defend now seek some skilful hand whose powerful art may stanch the effusion and extract the dart
herald be swift and bid machaon bring his speedy succour to the spartan king pierced with a winged shaft the deed of troy the grecian sorrow and the dardan joy
with hasty zeal the swift talthybius fly through the thick files he dart his searching eye and finds machaon where sublime he stands
then thus machaon to the king repair his wounded brother claims thy timely care pierced by some lycian or dardanian bow a grief to us a triumph to the foe
in arm incircled with his native band the heavy tidings grieved the godlike man swift to his succour through the rank he ran
the dauntless king yet standing firm he found and all the chief in deep concern around where to the steely point the reed was join
straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced he loosed the corslet from his breast unbraced then suck the blood and sovereign balm infused
while round the prince the greeks employ their care the trojans rush tumultuous to the war once more they glitter in refulgent arm once more the field are fill with dire alarm
the shaft he drew but left the head behind which chiron gave and ćsculapius used nor had you seen the king of man appear confused unactive or surprised with fear
no longer with his warlike steed he stay or press the car with polish brass inlaid but left eurymedon the rein to guide the fiery courser snorted at his side
but fond of glory with severe delight his beating bosom claim the rising fight on foot through all the martial rank he moves
he cry to such who boldly dare urge their swift steed to face the coming war your ancient valour on the foe approve which_jove is with greece and let us trust in which_jove
whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head her son and matrons greece shall lead in chains and her dead warrior strew the mournful plain
and these encourages and those reproves brave man tis not for us but guilty troy to dread thus with new ardour he the brave inspires or thus the fearful with reproaches fire
shame to your country scandal of your kind born to the fate ye well deserve to find why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain prepared for flight but doom to fly in vain
confused and panting thus the hunted deer fall as he fly a victim to his fear still must ye wait the foe and still retire till yon tall vessel blaze with trojan fire
this said he stalk with ample strides along to crete brave monarch and his martial throng high at their head he saw the chief appear and bold meriones excite the rear
or trust ye which_jove a valiant foe shall chase to save a trembling heartless dastard race at this the king his generous joy
express and clasp the warrior to his armed breast divine idomeneus what thanks we owe to worth like thine what praise shall we bestow
for this in banquets when the generous bowls restore our blood and raise the warrior soul though all the rest with stated rules we bound unmix unmeasured are thy goblets crown

he drops the corpse of simoisius slain and sinks a breathless carcase on the plain a chief stood nigh who from abydos came old priam son democoon was his name

with grief the leader of the lycian band saw the wide waste of his destructive hand his bended bow against the chief he drew swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore
deep in his shoulder pierced and drank the gore the rushing stream his brazen armour dyed while the proud archer thus exulting cried hither ye trojans hither drive your steed

to him the lycian whom your eye behold if right i judge is diomed the bold such courser whirl him er the dusty field so tower his helmet and so flame his shield
if tis a god he wears that chief disguise or if that chief some guardian of the sky involved in cloud protects him in the fray and turns unseen the frustrate dart away
i wing an arrow which not idly fell the stroke had fix him to the gate of hell and but some god some angry god withstands his fate was due to these unerring hand
skill in the bow on foot i sought the war nor join swift horse to the rapid car ten polish chariot i possess at home
and still they grace lycaon princely dome there veil in spacious coverlets they stand and twice ten courser wait their lord command
the good old warrior bade me trust to these when first for troy i sail the sacred sea in field aloft the whirling car to guide and through the rank of death triumphant ride
but vain with youth and yet to thrift inclined i heard his counsel with unheedful mind and thought the steed your large supplies unknown might fail of forage in the straiten town
so took my bow and pointed dart in hand and left the chariot in my native land too late friend
my rashness i deplore these shafts once fatal carry death no more tydeus and atreus son their point have found and undissembled gore pursued the wound
in vain they bleed this unavailing bow serves not to slaughter but provoke the foe in evil hour these bended horns i strung and seized the quiver where it idly hung
cursed be the fate that sent me to the field without a warrior arm the spear and shield if er with life i quit the trojan plain
if er i see my spouse and sire again this bow unfaithful to my glorious aims broke by my hand shall feed the blazing flame
to whom the leader of the dardan race be calm nor phoebus honour gift disgrace the distant dart be praised though here we need the rushing chariot and the bounding steed
now mount my seat and from the chariot height observe my father steed renown in fight practised alike to turn to stop to chase to dare the shock or urge the rapid race secure with these through fighting field we go or safe to troy if which_jove assist the foe
haste seize the whip and snatch the guiding rein the warrior fury let this arm sustain or if to combat thy bold heart incline take thou the spear the chariot care be mine
against yon hero let us bend our course and hand to hand encounter force with force prince lycaon valiant son replied
as thine the steed be thine the task to guide the horse practised to their lord command shall bear the rein and answer to thy hand
but if unhappy we desert the fight thy voice alone can animate their flight else shall our fate be number with the dead and these the victor prize in triumph led
and now both hero mount the glittering car the bounding courser rush amidst the war their fierce approach bold sthenelus espied
thine be the guidance then with spear and shield myself will charge this terror of the field who thus alarm to great tydides cried friend
two chief of force immense i see dreadful they come and bend their rage on thee lo the brave heir of old lycaon line and great ćneas sprung from race divine
at this the hero cast a gloomy look fix on the chief with scorn and thus he spoke me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight
enough is given to fame ascend thy car and save a life the bulwark of our war me wouldst thou move to base inglorious flight
i hate the cumbrous chariot slow advance and the long distance of the flying lance but while my nerves are strong my force entire thus front the foe and emulate my sire
know tis not honest in my soul to fear nor was tydides born to tremble here nor shall yon steed that fierce to fight convey those threatening hero bear them both away
but if she dooms and if no god withstand that both shall fall by one victorious hand then heed my word my horse here detain fix to the chariot by the straiten rein swift to ćneas empty seat proceed and seize the courser of ethereal breed the race of those which once the thundering god
one chief at least beneath this arm shall die so pallas tells me and forbids to fly for ravish ganymede on
hence great anchises stole a breed unknown by mortal mares from fierce laomedon four of this race his ample stalls contain and two transport ćneas er the plain
tros bestow the best that er on earth broad surface run beneath the rising or the setting sun these were the rich immortal prize our own
through the wide world should make our glory known thus while they spoke the foe came furious on and stern_hector lycaon warlike race begun prince thou art met
he said then shook the ponderous lance and flung on his broad shield the sounding weapon rung pierced the tough orb and in his cuirass hung he bleeds
though late in vain assail the spear may enter where the arrow fail the pride of greece the boaster cry
our triumph now the mighty warrior lies mistaken vaunter diomed replied thy dart has erred and now my spear be tried ye scape not both one headlong from his car
with hostile blood shall glut the god of war he spoke and rising hurl his forceful dart which driven by pallas pierced a vital part
full in his face it enter and betwixt the nose and eye ball the proud lycian fix crash all his jaws and cleft the tongue within till the bright point look out beneath the chin
headlong he fall his helmet knocks the ground earth groans beneath him and his arm resound the starting courser tremble with affright the soul indignant seeks the realm of night
to guard his slaughter friend ćneas fly his spear extending where the carcase lies watchful he wheels protects it every way
as the grim lion stalks around his prey er the fall trunk his ample shield display he hides the hero with his mighty shade and threats aloud
the greeks with longing eye behold at distance but forbear the prize then fierce tydides stoops and from the field heaved with vast force a rocky fragment wields
not two strong man the enormous weight could raise such man as live in these degenerate day he swung it round and gathering strength to throw discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe
full on the bone the pointed marble light through both the tendons broke the rugged stone and stripp the skin and crack the solid bone
sunk on his knees and staggering with his pain his falling bulk his bended arm sustains lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies a sudden cloud comes swimming er his eye
there the brave chief who mighty number sway oppress had sunk to death eternal shade but heavenly venus mindful of the love she bore anchises in the idaean grove his danger view with anguish and despair and guards her offspring with a mother care
where to the hip the inserted thigh unites about her much loved son her arm she throws her arm whose whiteness match the falling snows
screen from the foe behind her shining veil the sword wave harmless and the javelin fail safe through the rushing horse and feather flight of sounding shafts she bears him from the fight
nor sthenelus with unassisting hand remain unheedful of his lord command his panting steed removed from out the war he fix with straiten traces to the car
next rushing to the dardan spoil detains the heavenly courser with the flowing manes these in proud triumph to the fleet convey
no longer now a trojan lord obey that charge to bold deipylus he gave whom most he loved as brave man love the brave
then mounting on his car resumed the rein and follow where tydides swept the plain meanwhile his conquest ravished from his eye
commission to the field like pallas dreadful with her sable shield or fierce bellona thundering at the wall while flame ascend and mighty ruin fall he knew soft combat suit the tender dame
the raging chief in chase of venus fly no goddess she new to the field and still a foe to fame
through breaking rank his furious course he bends and at the goddess his broad lance extends through her bright veil the daring weapon drove
the ambrosial veil which all the grace wove her snowy hand the razing steel profaned and the transparent skin with crimson
stain from the clear vein a stream immortal flow such stream as issues from a wounded god pure emanation uncorrupted flood
unlike our gross diseased terrestrial blood for not the bread of man their life sustains nor wine inflaming juice supplies their veins
with tender shrieks the goddess fill the place and dropp her offspring from her weak embrace him phoebus took he casts a cloud around the fainting chief and wards the mortal wound
ill with which_jove daughter bloody fight agree the field of combat is no scene for thee go let thy own soft sex employ thy care
then with a voice that shook the vaulted sky the king insults the goddess as she fly go lull the coward or delude the fair
taught by this stroke renounce the war alarm and learn to tremble at the name of arm tydides thus the goddess seized with dread confused distracted from the conflict fled
to aid her swift the winged iris flew wrapt in a mist above the warring crew the queen of love with faded charm she found
far on the left with cloud involved he lay beside him stood his lance distain with gore and rein with gold his foaming steed before
pale was her cheek and livid look the wound to mars who sat remote they bent their way low at his knee she begg with streaming eye her brother car to mount the distant sky
stern_hector mars attentive hears the queen complain and to her hand commits the golden rein she mounts the seat oppress with silent woe
and show the wound by fierce tydides given a mortal man who dares encounter heaven driven by the goddess of the painted bow
they stopp the car and there the courser stood fed by fair iris with ambrosial food before her mother love bright queen appears erwhelmed with anguish and dissolved in tear she raised her in her arm beheld her bleed
the lash resounds the rapid chariot fly and in a moment scales the lofty sky and ask what god had wrought this guilty deed
illustration venus wounded in the hand conducted by iris to mars venus wounded in the hand conducted by iris to mars
then she this insult from no god i found an impious mortal gave the daring wound behold the deed of haughty diomed
twas in the son defence the mother bled the war with troy no more the grecians wage but with the god the immortal god engage
dione then thy wrongs with patience bear and share those grief inferior power must share unnumber woe mankind from us sustain and man with woe afflict the god again
the mighty mars in mortal fetters bound and lodged in brazen dungeons underground full thirteen moons imprison roar in vain otus and ephialtes held the chain perhaps had perish d
great juno self has borne her weight of pain the imperial partner of the heavenly reign amphitryon son infix the deadly dart
had not hermes care restored the groaning god to upper air and fill with anguish her immortal heart en hell grim king
the shaft found entrance in his iron breast to which_jove high palace for a cure he fled pierced in his own dominions of the dead where paeon sprinkling heavenly balm around assuaged the glowing pangs and closed the wound
alcides power confess rash impious man to stain the bless abodes and drench his arrow in the blood of god illustration otus and ephialtes holding mars captive
but thou though pallas urged thy frantic deed whose spear ill fated makes a goddess bleed know thou whoe er with heavenly power contends short is his date and soon his glory ends
otus and ephialtes holding mars captive from field of death when late he shall retire no infant on his knees shall call him sire
strong as thou art some god may yet be found to stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground thy distant wife ćgiale the fair starting from sleep with a distracted air shall rouse thy slaves and her lost lord deplore the brave the great the glorious now no more
this said she wiped from venus wounded palm the sacred ichor and infused the balm juno and pallas with a smile survey
to tell how this mischance the cyprian queen befell as late she tried with passion to inflame the tender bosom of a grecian dame
allured the fair with moving thought of joy to quit her country for some youth of troy the clasping zone with golden buckles bound razed her soft hand with this lamented wound
the sire of god and man superior smiled and calling venus thus address his child not these daughter are thy proper care thee milder art befit and softer war sweet smiles are thine and kind endearing charm to mars and pallas leave the deed of arm

mindful of this in friendship let us join if heaven our steps to foreign land incline my guest in argos thou and i in lycia thine
enough of trojans to this lance shall yield in the full harvest of yon ample field enough of greeks shall dye thy spear with gore
but thou and diomed be foe no more now change we arm and prove to either host we guard the friendship of the line we boast
thus having said the gallant chief alight their hand they join their mutual faith they plight brave glaucus then each narrow thought resign which_jove warm his bosom and enlarged his mind
for diomed brass arm of mean device for which nine oxen paid a vulgar price he gave his own of gold divinely wrought
a hundred beeves the shining purchase bought meantime the guardian of the trojan state great stern_hector enter at the scaean gate
beneath the beech tree consecrated shade the trojan matrons and the trojan maid around him flock all press with pious care for husbands brother son engaged in war
he bids the train in long procession go and seek the god to avert the impending woe and now to priam stately courts he came rais on arch columns of stupendous frame
er these a range of marble structure runs the rich pavilions of his fifty son in fifty chambers lodged and rooms of state
opposed to those where priam daughter sate twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone of equal beauty and of polish stone
hither great stern_hector pass nor pass unseen of royal hecuba his mother queen with her laodice whose beauteous face surpass the nymphs of troy illustrious race
stern_hector say what great occasion calls my son from fight when greece surrounds our wall com st thou to supplicate the almighty power with lifted hand from ilion lofty tower
long in a strict embrace she held her son and press his hand and tender thus begun stay till i bring the cup with

bacchus crown in which_jove high name to sprinkle on the ground and pay due vows to all the god around far hence be bacchus gift the chief rejoin
inflaming wine pernicious to mankind unnerves the limb and dulls the noble mind let chief abstain and spare the sacred juice to sprinkle to the god its better use
by me that holy office were profaned ill fits it me with human gore distain to the pure sky these horrid hand to raise or offer heaven great sire polluted praise
the largest mantle your full wardrobes hold most prized for art and labour o er with gold before the goddess honour knees be spread and twelve young heifers to her altar led
so may the power atoned by fervent prayer our wife our infant and our city spare and far avert tydides wasteful ire
you with your matrons go a spotless train and burn rich odours in minerva fane who mows whole troop and makes all troy retire
be this mother your religious care i go to rouse soft paris to the war if yet not lost to all the sense of shame the recreant warrior hear the voice of fame
oh would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace that pest of troy that ruin of our race deep to the dark abyss might he descend troy yet should flourish and my sorrow end
this heard she gave command and summon came each noble matron and illustrious dame the phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went where treasured odours breathed a costly scent
there lay the vestures of no vulgar art sidonian maid embroider every part whom from soft sidon youthful paris bore with argive_helen touching on the tyrian shore
the various textures and the various dyes she chose a veil that shone superior far and glow refulgent as the morning star
here as the queen revolved with careful eye herself with this the long procession leads the train majestically slow proceeds soon as to ilion topmost tower they come and awful reach
the high palladian dome antenor consort fair theano waits as pallas priestess and unbars the gate with hand uplifted and imploring eye they fill the dome with supplicating cry
the priestess then the shining veil displays placed on minerva knees and thus she prays oh awful goddess ever dreadful maid troy strong defence unconquer pallas aid
break thou tydides spear and let him fall prone on the dust before the trojan wall so twelve young heifers guiltless of the yoke shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke
but thou atoned by penitence and prayer ourselves our infant and our city spare so pray the priestess in her holy fane so vow the matrons but they vow in vain
while these appear before the power with prayer stern_hector to paris lofty dome repairs himself the mansion raised from every part assembling architects of matchless art
near priam court and stern_hector palace stands the pompous structure and the town command a spear the hero bore of wondrous strength of full ten cubits was the lance length
before him brandish at each motion shined thus entering in the glittering rooms he found his brother chief whose useless arm lay round his eye delighting with their splendid show brightening the shield and polishing the bow
the steely point with golden ringlets join beside him argive_helen with her virgins stands guides their rich labour and instructs their hand
him thus inactive with an ardent look the prince beheld and high resenting spoke thy hate to troy is this the time to show
wretch ill fated and thy country foe paris and greece against us both conspire thy close resentment and their vengeful ire
for thee great ilion guardian hero fall till heap of dead alone defend her wall for thee the soldier bleeds the matron mourns and wasteful war in all its fury burns
ungrateful man deserves not this thy care our troop to hearten and our toil to share rise or behold the conquering flame ascend and all the phrygian glory at an end
brother tis just replied the beauteous youth thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth yet charge my absence less generous chief
on hate to troy than conscious shame and grief here hid from human eye thy brother sate and mourn in secret his and ilion fate
tis now enough now glory spreads her charm and beauteous argive_helen calls her chief to arm conquest to day my happier sword may bless tis man to fight but heaven to give success
but while i arm contain thy ardent mind or go and paris shall not lag behind illustration stern_hector chiding paris
stern_hector chiding paris he said nor answer priam warlike son when argive_helen thus with lowly grace begun oh generous brother if the guilty dame that caused these woe deserve a sister name
would heaven ere all these dreadful deed were done the day that show me to the golden sun had seen my death
why did not whirlwinds bear the fatal infant to the fowls of air why sunk i not beneath the whelming tide and midst the roarings of the water died
heaven fill up all my ills and i accursed bore all and paris of those ills the worst argive_helen at least a braver spouse might claim warm with some virtue some regard of fame
the god have link our miserable doom our present woe and infamy to come wide shall it spread and last through age long example sad
now tired with toil thy fainting limb recline with toil sustain for paris sake and mine and theme of future song
the chief replied this time forbids to rest the trojan band by hostile fury press demand their stern_hector and his arm require the combat urges and my soul on fire
urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls and timely join me ere i leave the wall ere yet i mingle in the direful fray my wife my infant claim a moment stay
this day perhaps the last that sees me here demands a parting word a tender tear this day some god who hates our trojan land may vanquish stern_hector by a grecian hand
he said and pass with sad presaging heart to seek his spouse his soul far dearer part at home he sought her but he sought in vain she with one maid of all her menial train had hence retired and with her second joy the young astyanax the hope of troy pensive she stood on ilion towery height beheld the war and sicken at the sight there her sad eye in vain her lord explore or weep the wound her bleeding country bore
but he who found not whom his soul desired whose virtue charm him as her beauty fired stood in the gate and ask d
if to the fane she went where late the mourning matrons made resort or sought her sisters in the trojan court
what way she bent her parting step not to the court replied the attendant train nor mix with matrons to minerva fane
to ilion steepy tower she bent her way to mark the fortunes of the doubtful day troy fled she heard before the grecian sword she heard and trembled for her absent lord
distracted with surprise she seem to fly fear on her cheek and sorrow her eye the nurse attended with her infant boy the young astyanax the hope of troy
stern_hector this heard return without delay swift through the town he trod his former way through streets of palaces and walks of state and met the mourner at the scaean gate
with haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair his blameless wife aetion wealthy heir cilician thebe great aetion sway
the nurse stood near in whose embraces press his only hope hung smiling at her breast whom each soft charm and early grace adorn
to this loved infant stern_hector gave the name scamandrius from scamander honour stream astyanax the trojans call the boy from his great father the defence of troy
silent the warrior smiled and pleased resign to tender passions all his mighty mind his beauteous princess cast a mournful look
and hippoplacus wide extended shade fair as the new born star that gilds the morn hung on his hand and then dejected spoke
her bosom laboured with a boding sigh and the big tear stood trembling in her eye illustration the meeting of stern_hector and andromache
the meeting of stern_hector and andromache too daring prince ah whither dost thou run ah too forgetful of thy wife and son
and think st thou not how wretched we shall be a widow i a helpless orphan he for sure such courage length of life denies and thou must fall thy virtue sacrifice
greece in her single hero strove in vain now host oppose thee and thou must be slain grant me god ere stern_hector meets his doom
all i can ask of heaven an early tomb so shall my day in one sad tenor run and end with sorrow as they first begun
no parent now remains my grief to share no father aid no mother tender care the fierce achilles wrapt our wall in fire laid thebe waste and slew my warlike sire
stern_hector as he was he yet revered the dead his radiant arm preserved from hostile spoil and laid him decent on the funeral pile then raised a mountain where his bones were burn the mountain nymphs the rural tomb adorn which_jove sylvan daughter bade their elms bestow
by the same arm my seven brave brother fell in one sad day beheld the gate of hell while the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed amid their field the hapless hero bled
my mother lived to wear the victor band the queen of hippoplacia sylvan land redeem too late she scarce beheld again her pleasing empire and her native plain when ah oppress by life consuming woe she fell a victim to diana bow
his fate compassion in the victor bred a barren shade and in his honour grow yet while my stern_hector still survives i see my father mother brother all in thee alas
my parent brother kindred all once more will perish if my stern_hector fall thy wife thy infant in thy danger share
that quarter most the skilful greeks annoy where yon wild fig trees join the wall of troy thou from this tower defend the important post there agamemnon point his dreadful host that pass tydides oilean_ajax strive to gain
oh prove a husband and a father care and there the vengeful spartan fire his train thrice our bold foe the fierce attack have given or led by hope or dictated from heaven
let other in the field their arm employ but stay my stern_hector here and guard his troy the chief replied that post shall be my care not that alone but all the work of war
how would the son of troy in arm renown and troy proud dame whose garments sweep the ground attaint the lustre of my former name should stern_hector basely quit the field of fame
my early youth was bred to martial pain my soul impels me to the embattled plain let me be foremost to defend the throne and guard my father glory and my own
yet come it will the day decreed by fate how my heart trembles while my tongue relates the day when thou imperial troy must bend and see thy warrior fall thy glory end
and yet no dire presage so wound my mind my mother death the ruin of my kind not priam hoary hair defiled with gore not all my brother gasping on the shore
as thine andromache thy grief i dread i see thee trembling weeping captive led in argive looms our battle to design and woe of which so large a part was thine
to bear the victor hard command or bring the weight of water from hyperia spring there while you groan beneath the load of life they cry behold the mighty stern_hector wife
some haughty greek who life thy tear to see imbitters all thy woe by naming me the thought of glory past and present shame a thousand grief shall waken at the name
may i lie cold before that dreadful day press with a load of monumental clay thy stern_hector wrapt in everlasting sleep shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep
thus having spoke the illustrious chief of troy stretch his fond arm to clasp the lovely boy the babe clung crying to his nurse breast scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest
with secret pleasure each fond parent smiled and stern_hector hasted to relieve his child the glittering terror from his brows unbound and placed the beaming helmet on the ground
then kiss the child and lifting high in air thus to the god preferr a father prayer thou whose glory fills the ethereal throne and all ye deathless power
grant him like me to purchase just renown to guard the trojans to defend the crown against his country foe the war to wage and rise the stern_hector of the future age
so when triumphant from successful toil of hero slain he bears the reeking spoil whole host may hail him with deserved acclaim and say this chief transcends his father fame while pleased amidst the general shouts of troy his mother conscious heart erflows with joy
he spoke and fondly gazing on her charm restored the pleasing burden to her arm soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid hush to repose and with a smile survey
protect my son the troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear she mingled with a smile a tender tear the soften chief with kind compassion view
and dried the falling drops and thus pursued andromache my soul far better part why with untimely sorrow heaves thy heart
no hostile hand can antedate my doom till fate condemns me to the silent tomb fix is the term to all the race of earth
and such the hard condition of our birth no force can then resist no flight can save all sink alike the fearful and the brave
no more but hasten to thy tasks at home there guide the spindle and direct the loom me glory summons to the martial scene the field of combat is the sphere for man
where hero war the foremost place i claim the first in danger as the first in fame thus having said the glorious chief resumes his towery helmet black with shading plumes
his princess part with a prophetic sigh unwilling part and oft reverts her eye that stream at every look then moving slow sought her own palace and indulged her woe
there while her tear deplored the godlike man through all her train the soft infection ran the pious maid their mingled sorrow shed and mourn the living stern_hector as the dead
but now no longer deaf to honour call forth issues paris from the palace wall in brazen arm that cast a gleamy ray swift through the town the warrior bends his way
breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground pamper and proud he seeks the wonted tide and laves in height of blood his shining side his head now freed he tosses to the sky his mane dishevell o er his shoulder fly he snuffs the females in the distant plain and spring exulting to his field again
in arm refulgent as the god of day the son of priam glorying in his might rush forth with stern_hector to the field of fight
the wanton courser thus with rein unbound with equal triumph sprightly bold and gay and now the warrior passing on the way the graceful paris first excused his stay
to whom the noble stern_hector thus replied chief in blood and now in arm allied thy power in war with justice none contest
known is thy courage and thy strength confess what pity sloth should seize a soul so brave or godlike paris live a woman slave
my heart weeps blood at what the trojans say and hope thy deed shall wipe the stain away haste then in all their glorious labour share for much they suffer for thy sake in war
these ills shall cease whene er by which_jove decree we crown the bowl to heaven and liberty while the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns and greece indignant through her sea return
illustration bow and bow case bow and bow case illustration iris iris book vii argument the single combat of stern_hector and oilean_ajax
the battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of stern_hector minerva is under apprehensions for the greeks apollo seeing her descend from olympus joins her near the scaean gate
they agree to put off the general engagement for that day and incite stern_hector to challenge the greeks to a single combat
nine of the prince accepting the challenge the lot is cast and fall upon oilean_ajax these hero after several attacks are parted by the night
the trojans calling a council antenor purposes the delivery of argive_helen to the greeks to which paris will not consent but offers to restore them her riches
priam sends a herald to make this offer and to demand a truce for burning the dead the last of which only is agreed to by agamemnon
when the funerals are performed the greeks pursuant to the advice of wise_nestor erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp flanked with tower and defended by a ditch and palisades
neptune testifies his jealousy at this work but is pacified by a promise from jupiter both army pass the night in feasting but jupiter disheartens the trojans with thunder and other signs of his wrath
the three and twentieth day ends with the duel of stern_hector and oilean_ajax the next day the truce is agreed another is taken up in the funeral rite of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ship
so that somewhat about three day is employed in this book the scene lies wholly in the field so spoke the guardian of the trojan state then rush impetuous through the scaean gate
as when to sailors labouring through the main that long have heaved the weary oar in vain which_jove bids at length the expected gales arise the gales blow grateful and the vessel fly
him paris follow to the dire alarm both breathing slaughter both resolved in arm so welcome these to troy desiring train the band are cheer the war awakes again
bold paris first the work of death begun on great menestheus areithous son sprung from the fair philomeda embrace the pleasing arne was his native place
then sunk eioneus to the shade below beneath his steely casque he felt the blow full on his neck from stern_hector weighty hand and roll with limb relax along the land
by glaucus spear the bold iphmous bleeds fix in the shoulder as he mounts his steed headlong he tumbles his slack nerves unbound
drop the cold useless members on the ground when now minerva saw her argives slain from vast olympus to the gleaming plain
fierce she descends apollo marked her flight nor shot less swift from ilion towery height radiant they met beneath the beechen shade when thus apollo to the blue eyed maid
what cause daughter of almighty which_jove thus wing thy progress from the realm above once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way to give to greece the long divided day
too much has troy already felt thy hate now breathe thy rage and hush the stern_hector debate this day the business of the field suspend war soon shall kindle and great ilion bend since vengeful goddess confederate join to raze her wall though built by hand divine
to whom the progeny of which_jove replies i left for this the council of the sky but who shall bid conflicting host forbear what art shall calm the furious son of war
to her the god great stern_hector soul incite to dare the boldest greek to single fight till greece provoked from all her number show a warrior worthy to be stern_hector foe
at this agreed the heavenly power withdrew sage helenus their secret counsel knew stern_hector inspired he sought to him address
thus told the dictates of his sacred breast son of priam let thy faithful ear receive my word thy friend and brother hear
go forth persuasive and a while engage the warring nation to suspend their rage then dare the boldest of the hostile train to mortal combat on the listed plain
he said the warrior heard the word with joy then with his spear restrain the youth of troy held by the midst athwart
for not this day shall end thy glorious date the god have spoke it and their voice is fate on either hand the squadrons part the expecting trojans stand great agamemnon bids the greeks forbear
they breathe and hush the tumult of the war the athenian maid and glorious god of day with silent joy the settling host survey
in form of vultures on the beech height they sit conceal and wait the future fight the thronging troop obscure the dusky field horrid with bristling spear and gleaming shield
the wave scarce heave the face of ocean sleeps and a still horror saddens all the deeps thus in thick order settling wide around at length composed they sit and shade the ground
great stern_hector first amidst both army broke the solemn silence and their power bespoke hear all ye trojan all ye grecian band what my soul prompts and what some god command
great which_jove averse our warfare to compose erwhelms the nation with new toil and woe war with a fiercer tide once more return till ilion fall or till yon navy burns
you then prince of the greeks appear tis stern_hector speaks and calls the god to hear from all your troop select the boldest knight
as when a general darkness veils the main soft zephyr curling the wide wat ry plain and him the boldest stern_hector dares to fight
here if i fall by chance of battle slain be his my spoil and his these arm remain but let my body to my friend return
and if apollo in whose aid i trust shall stretch your daring champion in the dust if mine the glory to despoil the foe on phoebus temple i ll his arm bestow
the breathless carcase to your navy sent greece on the shore shall raise a monument which when some future mariner surveys wash by broad hellespont resounding sea thus shall he say a valiant greek lies there
by trojan hand and trojan flame be burn by stern_hector slain the mighty man of war the stone shall tell your vanquish hero name
and distant age learn the victor fame this fierce defiance greece astonish heard blush to refuse and to accept it fear
whose coward soul your manly form disgrace how great the shame when every age shall know that not a grecian met this noble foe
stern_hector great_menelaus first the silence broke and inly groaning thus opprobrious spoke women of greece scandal of your race go then
be what ye seem unanimated clay myself will dare the danger of the day tis man bold task the generous strife to try
resolve to earth from whence ye grew a heartless spiritless inglorious crew but in the hand of god is victory
these word scarce spoke with generous ardour press his manly limb in azure arm he dress that day atrides a superior hand had stretch d
but all at once thy fury to compose the king of greece an awful band arose even he their chief great agamemnon press thy daring hand and this advice address
thee breathless on the hostile strand whither great_menelaus wouldst thou run and tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun
grieved though thou art forbear the rash design great hectors arm is mightier far than thine even fierce achilles learn its force to fear and trembling met this dreadful son of war
the mightiest warrior of the achaian name though bold and burning with desire of fame content the doubtful honour might forego so great the danger and so brave the foe
sit thou secure amidst thy social band greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand he said and turn his brother vengeful mind
he stoop to reason and his rage resign no longer bent to rush on certain harms his joyful friend unbrace his azure arm
he from whose lips divine persuasion flows grave wise_nestor then in graceful act arose thus to the king he spoke what grief what shame attend on greece and all the grecian name
how shall alas her hoary hero mourn their son degenerate and their race a scorn what tear shall down thy silvery beard be
once with what joy the generous prince would hear of every chief who fought this glorious war participate their fame and pleased inquire
should he see our warrior trembling stand and trembling all before one hostile hand how would he lift his aged arm on high lament inglorious greece and beg to die
roll o peleus old in arm in wisdom old each name each action and each hero sire god oh would to all the immortal power above minerva phoebus and almighty which_jove
year might again roll back my youth renew and give this arm the spring which once it knew when fierce in war where jardan water fall i led my troop to phea trembling wall
there ereuthalion braved us in the field proud areithous dreadful arm to wield great areithous known from shore to shore by the huge knotted iron mace he bore no lance he shook nor bent the twanging bow but broke with this the battle of the foe
and with the arcadian spear my prowess tried where celadon rolls down his rapid tide him not by manly force lycurgus slew whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew
deep in a winding way his breast assailed nor aught the warrior thundering mace avail supine he fell those arm which mars before had given the vanquish now the victor bore
furious with this he crush our levell band and dared the trial of the strongest hand nor could the strongest hand his fury stay all saw and fear his huge tempestuous sway
but when old age had dimm lycurgus eye to ereuthalion he consign the prize till i the youngest of the host appear and youngest met whom all our army fear
i fought the chief my arm minerva crown prone fell the giant er a length of ground what then i was were your wise_nestor now
but warrior you that youthful vigour boast the flower of greece the examples of our host sprung from such father who such number sway can you stand trembling and desert the day
his warm reproofs the listening king inflame and nine the noblest of the grecian name up started fierce but far before the rest
not stern_hector self should want an equal foe the king of man advanced his dauntless breast then bold tydides great in arm
and merion dreadful as the god of war with these eurypylus and thoas stand and wise_nestor ulysses closed the daring band
appear and next his bulk gigantic oilean_ajax rear oileus follow idomen was there all these alike inspired with noble rage demand the fight
to whom the pylian sage lest thirst of glory your brave soul divide what chief shall combat let the god decide
whom heaven shall choose be his the chance to raise his country fame his own immortal praise the lots produced each hero signs his own then in the general helm the fate are thrown
in whose hand is fate a worthy champion for the grecian state this task let oilean_ajax or tydides prove or he the king of king beloved by which_jove
the people pray with lifted eye and hand and vows like these ascend from all the band grant thou almighty
this from the right to left the herald bears held out in order to the grecian peers each to his rival yields the mark unknown till godlike oilean_ajax finds the lot his own surveys the inscription with rejoicing eye then casts before him and with transport cry
old wise_nestor shook the casque by heaven inspired leap forth the lot of every greek desired warrior i claim the lot and arm with joy be mine the conquest of this chief of troy
now while my brightest arm my limb invest to saturn son be all your vows address but pray in secret lest the foe should hear and deem your prayer the mean effect of fear
said i in secret no your vows declare in such a voice as fills the earth and air life there a chief whom oilean_ajax ought to dread
oilean_ajax in all the toil of battle bred from warlike salamis i drew my birth and born to combat fear no force on earth
he said the troop with elevated eye implore the god whose thunder rends the sky father of mankind superior lord
on lofty ida holy hill adored who in the highest heaven hast fix thy throne supreme of god unbounded and alone
the praise and conquest of this doubtful day or if illustrious stern_hector be thy care that both may claim it and that both may share
now oilean_ajax braced his dazzling armour on sheathed in bright steel the giant warrior shone he moves to combat with majestic pace so stalks in arm the grisly god of thrace
grant thou that ajax_telamon may bear away when which_jove to punish faithless man prepares and gives whole nation to the waste of war
thus march the chief tremendous as a god grimly he smiled earth trembled as he strode his massy javelin quivering in his hand he stood the bulwark of the grecian band
through every argive heart new transport ran all troy stood trembling at the mighty man even stern_hector paused and with new doubt oppress felt his great heart suspended in his breast twas vain to seek retreat and vain to fear himself had challenged and the foe drew near
huge was its orb with seven thick folds ercast of tough bull hides of solid brass the last the work of tychius who in hyle dwell d
and in all art of armoury excell this oilean_ajax bore before his manly breast and threatening thus his adverse chief address
stern_hector ajax_telamon behind his ample shield as from a brazen tower erlook the field stern_hector approach my arm and singly know what strength thou hast and what the grecian foe
let him unactive on the sea beat shore indulge his wrath and aid our arm no more whole troop of hero greece has yet to boast and sends thee one a sample of her host such as i am i come to prove thy might
achilles shuns the fight yet some there are not void of soul and not unskill in war no more be sudden and begin the fight
son of ajax_telamon thy country pride to oilean_ajax thus the trojan prince replied me as a boy or woman wouldst thou fright new to the field and trembling at the fight
to combat born and bred amidst alarm i know to shift my ground remount the car turn charge and answer every call of war to right to left the dexterous lance i wield and bear thick battle on my sounding shield
thou meet st a chief deserving of thy arm but open be our fight and bold each blow i steal no conquest from a noble foe
he said and rising high above the field whirl the long lance against the sevenfold shield full on the brass descending from above through six bull hides the furious weapon drove
then oilean_ajax threw through stern_hector shield the forceful javelin flew his corslet enters and his garment rends and glancing downwards near his flank descends
till in the seventh it fix the wary trojan shrinks and bending low beneath his buckler disappoints the blow from their bored shield the chief their javelin drew then close impetuous and the charge renew
at oilean_ajax stern_hector his long lance extends the blunted point against the buckler bends but oilean_ajax watchful as his foe drew near drove through the trojan targe the knotty spear
fierce as the mountain lion bathed in blood or foaming boars the terror of the wood it reach his neck with matchless strength impell
yet ceased not stern_hector thus but stooping down in his strong hand up heaved a flinty stone black craggy vast to this his force he bends full on the brazen boss the stone descends the hollow brass resounded with the shock then oilean_ajax seized the fragment of a rock applied each nerve and swinging round on high
with force tempestuous let the ruin fly the huge stone thundering through his buckler broke his slacken knees received the numbing stroke great stern_hector fall extended on the field his bulk supporting on the shatter shield nor wanted heavenly aid
spouts the black gore and dims his shining shield apollo might confirm his sinews and restored to fight and now both hero their broad falchions drew
in flaming circle round their head they flew but then by herald voice the word was given the sacred ministers of earth and heaven divine talthybius whom the greeks employ
and sage idaeus on the part of troy between the sword their peaceful sceptres rear and first idaeus awful voice was heard illustration stern_hector and oilean_ajax separated by the herald
stern_hector and oilean_ajax separated by the herald forbear my son your further force to prove both dear to man and both beloved of which_jove
to either host your matchless worth is known each sound your praise and war is all your own but now the night extends her awful shade the goddess part you be the night obey
let him who first provoked our chief to fight let him demand the sanction of the night if first he ask it
to whom great oilean_ajax his high soul express o sage to stern_hector be these word address i content obey and cease the strife when stern_hector shows the way
first of greeks his noble foe rejoin whom heaven adorns superior to thy kind with strength of body and with worth of mind
now martial law command us to forbear hereafter we shall meet in glorious war some future day shall lengthen out the strife and let the god decide of death or life
return brave oilean_ajax to thy grecian friend and joy the nation whom thy arm defends as i shall glad each chief and trojan wife who wearies heaven with vows for stern_hector life
but let us on this memorable day exchange some gift that greece and troy may say not hate but glory made these chief contend and each brave foe was in his soul a friend
since then the night extends her gloomy shade and heaven enjoins it be the night obey with that a sword with stars of silver graced the baldric studded and the sheath enchased he gave the greek
the generous greek bestow a radiant belt that rich with purple glow then with majestic grace they quit the plain this seeks the grecian that the phrygian train
the trojan band returning stern_hector wait and hail with joy the champion of their state escaped great oilean_ajax they survey him round alive unarm and vigorous from his wound to troy high gate the godlike man they bear their present triumph as their late despair
but oilean_ajax glorying in his hardy deed the well arm greeks to agamemnon lead a steer for sacrifice the king design of full five year and of the nobler kind
the victim fall they strip the smoking hide the beast they quarter and the joints divide then spread the tables the repast prepare
each takes his seat and each receives his share the king himself an honorary sign before great oilean_ajax placed the mighty chine
when now the rage of hunger was removed wise_nestor in each persuasive art approved the sage whose counsel long had sway d
the rest in word like these his prudent thought express how dear king this fatal day has cost what greeks are perish what a people lost
what tide of blood have drench scamander shore what crowds of hero sunk to rise no more then hear me chief nor let the morrow light
awake thy squadrons to new toil of fight some space at least permit the war to breathe while we to flame our slaughter friend bequeath from the red field their scatter body bear and nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear so decent urns their snowy bones may keep and pious children er their ashes weep
here where on one promiscuous pile they blazed high er them all a general tomb be raised next to secure our camp and naval power raise an embattled wall with lofty tower from space to space be ample gate around
for passing chariot and a trench profound so greece to combat shall in safety go nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe
twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved the sceptred king of greece his word approved meanwhile convened at priam palace gate
the trojan peers in nightly council sate a senate void of order as of choice their heart were fearful and confused their voice
tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires and i but move what every god requires let sparta treasures be this hour restored and argive_helen own her ancient lord
antenor rising thus demands their ear ye trojans dardans and auxiliars hear the ties of faith the sworn alliance broke our impious battle the just god provoke
as this advice ye practise or reject so hope success or dread the dire effect the senior spoke and sate

to whom replied the graceful husband of the spartan bride cold counsel trojan may become thy year then hear me prince of the trojan name
their treasures i ll restore but not the dame my treasures too for peace i will resign but be this bright possession ever mine
twas then the growing discord to compose slow from his seat the reverend priam rose his godlike aspect deep attention drew he paused and these pacific word ensue ye trojans dardans and auxiliar band
now take refreshment as the hour demands guard well the wall relieve the watch of night till the new sun restores the cheerful light
next let a truce be ask that troy may burn her slaughter hero and their bones inurn that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty which_jove decide
then shall our herald to the atrides sent before their ship proclaim my son intent the monarch spoke the warrior snatch with haste each at his post in arm a short repast
idaeus bent his way there to the son of mars in council found he raised his voice the host stood listening round
soon as the rosy morn had waked the day to the black ship ye son of atreus and ye greeks give ear
the word of troy and troy great monarch hear pleased may ye hear so heaven succeed my prayer what paris author of the war declares
the spoil and treasures he to ilion bore oh had he perish ere they touch our shore he proffers injured greece with large increase of added trojan wealth to buy the peace
but to restore the beauteous bride again this greece demands and troy requests in vain next ye chief we ask a truce to burn our slaughter hero and their bones inurn
that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty which_jove decide the greeks gave ear but none the silence broke at length tydides rose and rising spoke
oh take not friend defrauded of your fame their proffer wealth nor even the spartan dame let conquest make them ours fate shakes their wall and troy already totters to her fall
the admiring chief and all the grecian name with general shouts return him loud acclaim then thus the king of king rejects the peace herald
in him thou hear st the voice of greece for what remains let funeral flame be fed with hero corps i war not with the dead
go search your slaughtered chief on yonder plain and gratify the manes of the slain be witness which_jove whose thunder rolls on high
he said and rear his sceptre to the sky to sacred troy where all her prince lay to wait the event the herald bent his way
he came and standing in the midst explain the peace rejected but the truce obtain straight to their several care the trojans move some search the plain some fell the sounding grove
and now from forth the chambers of the main to shed his sacred light on earth again arose the golden chariot of the day and tipp the mountain with a purple ray
nor less the greeks descending on the shore hew the green forests and the body bore in mingled throng the greek and trojan train through heap of carnage search the mournful plain
scarce could the friend his slaughter friend explore with dust dishonour and deformed with gore the wound they wash their pious tear they shed and laid along their car deplored the dead
with silent haste the body decent on the piles were placed with melting heart the cold remains they burn and sadly slow to sacred troy return
nor less the greeks their pious sorrow shed and decent on the pile dispose the dead the cold remains consume with equal care and slowly sadly to their fleet repair
now ere the morn had streak with reddening light the doubtful confines of the day and night about the dying flame
sage priam check their grief the greeks appear and round the pile a general tomb they rear then to secure the camp and naval power they raised embattled wall with lofty tower
from space to space were ample gate around for passing chariot and a trench profound of large extent and deep in earth below strong piles infix stood adverse to the foe
in shining circle round their father which_jove amazed beheld the wondrous work of man then he whose trident shakes the earth began what mortal henceforth shall our power adore our fanes frequent our oracles implore if the proud grecians thus successful boast their rising bulwarks on the sea beat coast
so toil the greeks meanwhile the god above see the long wall extending to the main no god consulted and no victim slain
their fame shall fill the world remotest ends wide as the morn her golden beam extends while old laomedon divine abodes those radiant structures raised by labouring god shall razed and lost in long oblivion sleep
thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep the almighty thunderer with a frown replies that cloud the world and blackens half the sky strong god of ocean
thou whose rage can make the solid earth eternal basis shake what cause of fear from mortal work could move the meanest subject of our realm above
where er the sun refulgent rays are cast thy power is honour and thy fame shall last but yon proud work no future age shall view no trace remain where once the glory grew
the sapp foundations by thy force shall fall and whelm beneath the wave drop the huge wall vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore
the ruin vanish and the name no more thus they in heaven while er the grecian train the rolling sun descending to the main beheld the finish work
their bulls they slew back from the tent the savoury vapour flew and now the fleet arrived from lemnos strands with bacchus blessings cheered the generous band
of fragrant wines the rich eunaeus sent a thousant measures to the royal tent eunaeus whom hypsipyle of yore to jason shepherd of his people bore
the rest they purchased at their proper cost and well the plenteous freight supplied the host each in exchange proportion treasures gave some brass or iron some an ox or slave
but which_jove averse the signs of wrath display and shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade humbled they stood pale horror seized on all while the deep thunder shook the aerial hall
all night they feast the greek and trojan power those on the field and these within their tower each pour to which_jove before the bowl was
crown and large libations drench the thirsty ground then late refresh with sleep from toil of fight enjoy the balmy blessings of the night

neptune with wrath rejects the rash design what rage what madness furious queen is thine i war not with the highest
now godlike stern_hector to whose matchless might which_jove gave the glory of the destined fight squadrons on squadrons drives and fills the field with close ranged chariot and with thicken shield
all above submit and tremble at the hand of which_jove where the deep trench in length extended lay compacted troop stand wedged in firm array a dreadful front
they shake the brands and threat with long destroying flame the hostile fleet the king of man by juno self inspired toil through the tent and all his army fired
swift as he moved he lifted in his hand his purple robe bright ensign of command high on the midmost bark the king
appear there from ulysses deck his voice was heard to oilean_ajax and achilles reach the sound whose distant ship the guarded navy bound
he cried the hollow vessel to his voice replied where now are all your glorious boasts of yore your hasty triumphs on the lemnian shore
each fearless hero dares a hundred foe while the feast lasts and while the goblet flows but who to meet one martial man is found when the fight rage and the flame surround
argives shame of human race mighty which_jove sire of the distress was ever king like me like me oppress
with power immense with justice arm in vain my glory ravish and my people slain to thee my vows were breathed from every shore
what altar smoked not with our victim gore with fat of bulls i fed the constant flame and ask destruction to the trojan name
now gracious god far humbler our demand give these at least to scape from stern_hector hand and save the relics of the grecian land
thus pray the king and heaven great father heard his vows in bitterness of soul preferr the wrath appeased by happy signs declares and gives the people to their monarch prayer
his eagle sacred bird of heaven he sent a fawn his talons truss divine portent high er the wondering host he soar above
who paid their vows to panomphaean which_jove then let the prey before his altar fall the greeks beheld and transport seized on all
tydides first of all the grecian force er the broad ditch impell his foaming horse pierced the deep rank their strongest battle tore and dyed his javelin red with trojan gore
encouraged by the sign the troop revive and fierce on troy with doubled fury drive young agelaus phradmon was his sire
with flying courser shunn his dreadful ire struck through the back the phrygian fell oppress the dart drove on and issued at his breast headlong he quits the car his arm resound his ponderous buckler thunder on the ground
forth rush a tide of greeks the passage freed the atridae first the ajaces next succeed meriones like mars in arm renown and godlike idomen now passed the mound evaemon son next issues to the foe and last young teucer with his bended bow
secure behind the telamonian shield the skilful archer wide survey the field with every shaft some hostile victim slew then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew
the conscious infant so when fear alarm retires for safety to the mother arm thus oilean_ajax guards his brother in the field
moves as he moves and turns the shining shield who first by teucer mortal arrow bled orsilochus then fell ormenus dead
the godlike lycophon next press the plain with chromius daetor ophelestes slain bold hamopaon breathless sunk to ground the bloody pile great melanippus crown
heap fell on heap sad trophies of his art a trojan ghost attending every dart great agamemnon view with joyful eye
thus always thus thy early worth be tried thy brave example shall retrieve our host thy country saviour and thy father boast
the rank grow thinner as his arrow fly youth forever dear the monarch cried sprung from an alien bed thy sire to grace the vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace
now hear a monarch vow if heaven high power give me to raze troy long defended tower whatever treasures greece for me design the next rich honorary gift be thine
some golden tripod or distinguished car with courser dreadful in the rank of war or some fair captive whom thy eye approve shall recompense the warrior toil with love
proud of his boy he own the generous flame and the brave son repays his care with fame to this the chief with praise the rest inspire nor urge a soul already fill with fire
what strength i have be now in battle tried till every shaft in phrygian blood be dyed since rallying from our wall we forced the foe still aim at stern_hector
have i bent my bow eight forky arrow from this hand have fled and eight bold hero by their point lie dead
but sure some god denies me to destroy this fury of the field this dog of troy he said and twang the string
the weapon fly at stern_hector breast and sings along the sky he miss the mark but pierced gorgythio heart and drench in royal blood the thirsty dart
decline the head and drooping kiss the plain so sinks the youth his beauteous head depress beneath his helmet drops upon his breast
fair castianira nymph of form divine this offspring added to king priam line as full blown poppies overcharged with rain another shaft the raging archer drew that other shaft with erring fury flew from stern_hector phoebus turn the flying wound
yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground thy breast brave archeptolemus it tore and dipp its feathers in no vulgar gore
headlong he fall his sudden fall alarm the steed that startle at his sounding arm stern_hector with grief his charioteer beheld all pale and breathless on the sanguine field
then bids cebriones direct the rein quits his bright car and issues on the plain dreadful he shouts from earth a stone he took and rush on teucer with the lifted rock
the forceful yew the shaft already to his shoulder drew the feather in his hand just wing for flight touch where the neck and hollow chest unite there where the juncture knits the channel bone the furious chief discharged the craggy stone
he fell but oilean_ajax his broad shield display and screen his brother with the mighty shade till great alaster and mecistheus bore the batter archer groaning to the shore
the youth already strain the bow string burst beneath the ponderous blow and his numb hand dismiss his useless bow troy yet found grace before the olympian sire
he arm their hand and fill their breast with fire the greeks repulsed retreat behind their wall or in the trench on heap confusedly fall
first of the foe great stern_hector march along with terror clothed and more than mortal strong as the bold hound that gives the lion chase with beating bosom and with eager pace
hangs on his haunch or fastens on his heels guards as he turns and circle as he wheels thus oft the grecians turn but still they flew
thus following stern_hector still the hindmost slew when flying they had pass the trench profound and many a chief lay gasping on the ground
before the ship a desperate stand they made and fired the troop and called the god to aid fierce on his rattling chariot stern_hector came his eye like gorgon shot a sanguine flame
that wither all their host like mars he stood dire as the monster dreadful as the god their strong distress the wife of which_jove survey
then pensive thus to war triumphant maid daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the sable shield
now in this moment of her last despair shall wretched greece no more confess our care condemn to suffer the full force of fate and drain the dregs of heaven relentless hate
god shall one raging hand thus level all what number fell what number yet shall fall what power divine shall stern_hector wrath assuage
so spake the imperial regent of the sky to whom the goddess with the azure eye long since had stern_hector stain these field with gore stretch by some argive on his native shore but he above the sire of heaven withstands mocks our attempts and slights our just demands the stubborn god inflexible and hard forgets my service and deserved reward
still swells the slaughter and still grows the rage saved i for this his favourite son distress by stern_hector eurystheus with long labour press
oh had my wisdom known this dire event when to grim pluto gloomy gate he went the triple dog had never felt his chain
he begg with tear he begg in deep dismay i shot from heaven and gave his arm the day nor styx been cross nor hell explored in vain
averse to me of all his heaven of god at thetis suit the partial thunderer nods to grace her gloomy fierce resenting son my hope are frustrate and my greeks undone
some future day perhaps he may be moved to call his blue eyed maid his best beloved haste launch thy chariot through yon rank to ride myself will arm and thunder at thy side
then goddess say shall stern_hector glory then that terror of the greeks that man of man when juno self and pallas shall appear all dreadful in the crimson walks of war
what mighty trojan then on yonder shore expiring pale and terrible no more shall feast the fowls and glut the dog with gore
she ceased and juno rein the steed with care heaven awful empress saturn other heir pallas meanwhile her various veil unbound with flowers adorn with art immortal

huge ponderous strong that when her fury burns proud tyrants humbles and whole host erturns saturnia lends the lash the courser fly smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky
they stand the sun bright portals and the sky command close or unfold the eternal gate of day bar heaven with cloud or roll those cloud away
heaven gate spontaneous open to the power heaven golden gate kept by the winged hour commission in alternate watch the sounding hinges ring the cloud divide
prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide but which_jove incensed from ida top survey and thus enjoin the many colour maid
illustration juno and minerva going to assist the greeks juno and minerva going to assist the greeks thaumantia mount the wind and stop their car against the highest who shall wage the war
if furious yet they dare the vain debate thus have i spoke and what i speak is fate their courser crush beneath the wheels shall lie
my lightning these rebellious shall confound and hurl them flaming headlong to the ground condemn for ten revolving year to weep the wound
their car in fragments scatter o er the sky impress by burning thunder deep so shall minerva learn to fear our ire nor dare to combat hers and nature sire
swift as the wind the various colour maid from ida top her golden wing display to great olympus shining gate she fly there meets the chariot rushing down the sky restrains their progress from the bright abodes and speaks the mandate of the sire of god
for juno headstrong and imperious still she claims some title to transgress our will what frenzy goddess what rage can move celestial mind to tempt the wrath of which_jove
his lightning your rebellion shall confound and hurl ye headlong flaming to the ground your horse crush beneath the wheels shall lie your car in fragments
desist obedient to his high command this is his word and know his word shall stand scatter o er the sky yourselves condemn ten rolling year to weep the wound impress d
by burning thunder deep so shall minerva learn to fear his ire nor dare to combat hers and nature sire for juno headstrong and imperious still she claims some title to transgress his will
then mounting on the pinions of the wind she flew and juno thus her rage resign o daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
no more let beings of superior birth contend with which_jove for this low race of earth triumphant now now miserably slain they breathe or perish as the fate ordain
but thee what desperate insolence has driven to lift thy lance against the king of heaven but which_jove high counsel full effect shall find
and ever constant ever rule mankind she spoke and backward turn her steed of light adorn with manes of gold and heavenly bright
there tied they rest in high celestial stalls the chariot propp against the crystal wall the pensive goddess abash controll mix with the god and fill their seat of gold
the hour unloosed them panting as they stood and heap their mangers with ambrosial food illustration the hour taking the horse from juno car
the hour taking the horse from juno car and now the thunderer meditates his flight from ida summits to the olympian height
swifter than thought the wheels instinctive fly flame through the vast of air and reach the sky twas neptune charge his courser to unbrace and fix the car on its immortal base
there stood the chariot beaming forth its rays till with a snowy veil he screen the blaze he whose all conscious eye the world behold the eternal thunderer sat enthroned in gold
high heaven the footstool of his foot he makes and wide beneath him all olympus shakes trembling afar the offending power appear confused and silent for his frown they fear
he saw their soul and thus his word imparts pallas and juno say why heave your heart soon was your battle er proud troy retired before your face and in your wrath expired
but know whoe er almighty power withstand unmatch our force unconquer is our hand who shall the sovereign of the sky control
not all the god that crown the starry pole your heart shall tremble if our arm we take and each immortal nerve with horror shake
for thus i speak and what i speak shall stand what power soe er provokes our lifted hand on this our hill no more shall hold his place cut off and exiled from the ethereal race
juno and pallas grieving hear the doom but feast their soul on ilion woe to come though secret anger swell d
minerva breast the prudent goddess yet her wrath repress but juno impotent of rage replies what hast thou said tyrant of the sky
strength and omnipotence invest thy throne tis thine to punish ours to grieve alone for greece we grieve abandon by her fate to drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate
from field forbidden we submiss refrain with arm unaiding see our argives slain yet grant our counsel still their breast may move lest all should perish in the rage of which_jove
the goddess thus and thus the god replies who swells the cloud and blackens all the sky the morning sun awaked by loud alarm shall see the almighty thunderer in arm
nor shall great stern_hector cease the rage of fight the navy flaming and thy greeks in flight even till the day when certain fate ordain that stern_hector achilles his patroclus slain
what heap of argives then shall load the plain those radiant eye shall view and view in vain shall rise in vengeance and lay waste the plain
for such is fate nor canst thou turn its course with all thy rage with all thy rebel force fly if thy wilt to earth remotest bound where on her utmost verge the sea resound
where cursed iapetus and saturn dwell fast by the brink within the stream of hell no sun er gilds the gloomy horror there no cheerful gales refresh the lazy air
now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light and drew behind the cloudy veil of night the conquering trojans mourn his beams decay d
there arm once more the bold titanian band and arm in vain for what i will shall stand the greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade
the victor keep the field and stern_hector calls a martial council near the navy wall these to scamander bank apart he led where thinly
a massy spear he bore of mighty strength of full ten cubits was the lance length the point was brass refulgent to behold fix to the wood with circling rings of gold the noble stern_hector on his lance reclined and bending forward thus reveal his mind
scatter lay the heap of dead the assembled chief descending on the ground attend his order and their prince surround ye valiant trojans with attention hear
ye dardan band and generous aid give ear this day we hoped would wrap in conquering flame greece with her ship and crown our toil with fame
but darkness now to save the cowards fall and guards them trembling in their wooden wall obey the night and use her peaceful hour
straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought and strengthening bread and generous wine be brought wide er the field high blazing to the sky
let numerous fire the absent sun supply the flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise till the bright morn her purple beam displays lest in the silence and the shade of night greece on her sable ship attempt her flight
not unmolested let the wretches gain their lofty decks or safely cleave the main some hostile wound let every dart bestow some lasting token of the phrygian foe wound that long hence may ask their spouses care
our steed to forage and refresh our power and warn their children from a trojan war now through the circuit of our ilion wall let sacred herald sound the solemn call to bid the sire with
firm be the guard while distant lie our power and let the matrons hang with light the tower lest under covert of the midnight shade the insidious foe the naked town invade
hoary honour crown and beardless youth our battlements surround suffice to night these order to obey a nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day
the god i trust shall give to stern_hector hand from these detested foe to free the land who plough with fate averse
our common safety must be now the care but soon as morning paints the field of air sheathed in bright arm let every troop engage and the fired fleet behold the battle rage
the watery way for trojan vultures a predestined prey then then shall stern_hector and tydides prove whose fate are heaviest in the scales of which_jove
shall see his bloody spoil in triumph borne with this keen javelin shall his breast be gored and prostrate hero bleed around their lord
certain as this oh might my day endure from age inglorious and black death secure so might my life and glory know no bound like pallas worshipp like the sun renown
to morrow light haste the glorious morn as the next dawn the last they shall enjoy shall crush the greeks and end the woe of troy
the leader spoke from all his host around shouts of applause along the shore resound each from the yoke the smoking steed untied and fix their headstalls to his chariot side
fat sheep and oxen from the town are led with generous wine and all sustaining bread full hecatombs lay burning on the shore
the wind to heaven the curling vapours bore ungrateful offering to the immortal power whose wrath hung heavy er the trojan tower
nor priam nor his son obtain their grace proud troy they hated and her guilty race the troop exulting sat in order round and beaming fire illumined all the ground

unnumber gild the glowing pole er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed and tip with silver every mountain head then shine the vales the rock in prospect rise a flood of glory bursts from all the sky the conscious swains rejoicing in the sight eye the blue vault and bless the useful light
as when the moon refulgent lamp of night and stars so many flame before proud ilion blaze and lighten glimmering xanthus with their rays

agamemnon pursues this advice and wise_nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to achilles in order to move him to a reconciliation
diomed opposes this and wise_nestor seconds him praising his wisdom and resolution ulysses and oilean_ajax are made choice of who are accompanied by old phoenix
they make each of them very moving and pressing speeches but are rejected with roughness by achilles who notwithstanding retains phoenix in his tent
this book and the next following take up the space of one night which is the twenty seventh from the beginning of the poem

as from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth a double tempest of the west and north swells er the sea from thracia frozen shore heap wave on wave and bids the ćgean roar
this way and that the boiling deeps are toss such various passions urged the troubled host great agamemnon grieved above the rest
himself his order to the herald bears to bid to council all the grecian peers but bid in whispers these surround their chief in solemn sadness and majestic grief
superior sorrow swell his royal breast the king amidst the mournful circle rose down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows

the embassy to achilles he said and all approved the herald bring the cleansing water from the living spring the youth with wine the sacred goblets crown and large libations drench the sands around
then from the royal tent they take their way wise_nestor turns on each his careful eye forbids to offend instructs them to apply much he advised them all
the rite perform the chief their thirst allay ulysses most to deprecate the chief and save the host through the still night they march and hear the roar of murmuring billows on the sounding shore
to neptune ruler of the sea profound whose liquid arm the mighty globe surround they pour forth vows their embassy to bless and calm the rage of stern_hector ćacides
the myrmidonian tent and vessel lay amused at ease the godlike man they found pleased with the solemn harp harmonious sound
and now arrived where on the sandy bay the well wrought harp from conquered thebae came of polish silver was its costly frame
with this he soothes his angry soul and sings the immortal deed of hero and of king patroclus only of the royal train placed in his tent attends the lofty strain
full opposite he sat and listen long in silence waiting till he ceased the song unseen the grecian embassy proceeds to his high tent the great ulysses leads
achilles starting as the chief he spied leap from his seat and laid the harp aside with like surprise arose menoetius son pelides grasp their hand and thus begun

meanwhile patroclus sweats the fire to raise the tent is brighten with the rising blaze health to achilles happy are thy guests
not those more honour whom atrides feasts though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards that agamemnon regal tent affords but greater care sit heavy on our soul nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls
the dead we mourn and for the living fear greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands and owns no help
troy and her aid for ready vengeance call their threatening tent already shade our wall hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim and point at every ship their vengeful flame
what scene of slaughter in yon field appear but from thy saving hand for them the father of the god declares theirs are his omens and his thunder theirs

he waits but for the morn to sink in flame the ship the greeks and all the grecian name heaven how my country woe distract my mind lest fate accomplish all his rage design
oh return though late to save thy greeks and stop the course of fate if in that heart or grief or courage lies rise to redeem ah yet to conquer rise
and must we god our head inglorious lay in trojan dust and this the fatal day return achilles the day may come when all our warrior slain that heart shall melt that courage rise in vain

ćpea fair the pastures hira yields and rich antheia with her flowery field the whole extent to pylos sandy plain along the verdant margin of the main
there heifers graze and labouring oxen toil bold are the man and generous is the soil there shalt thou reign with power and justice crown and rule the tributary realm around
but if all this relentless thou disdain if honour and if interest plead in vain yet some redress to suppliant greece afford and be amongst her guardian god adored
such are the proffers which this day we bring such the repentance of a suppliant king if no regard thy suffering country claim hear thy own glory and the voice of fame
for now that chief whose unresisted ire made nation tremble and whole host retire proud stern_hector now the unequal fight demands and only triumphs to deserve thy hand
then thus the goddess born ulysses hear a faithful speech that knows nor art nor fear what in my secret soul is understood my tongue shall utter and my deed make good
let greece then know my purpose i retain nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain who dares think one thing and another tell my heart detests him as the gate of hell
then thus in short my fix resolves attend which nor atrides nor his greeks can bend long toil long perils in their cause i bore
but now the unfruitful glory charm no more fight or not fight a like reward we claim the wretch and hero find their prize the same
alike regretted in the dust he lies who yields ignobly or who bravely dies of all my danger all my glorious pain a life of labour lo
as the bold bird her helpless young attends from danger guards them and from want defends in search of prey she wing the spacious air
for thankless greece such hardships have i braved her wife her infant by my labour saved long sleepless night in heavy arm i stood and sweat laborious day in dust and blood
and twelve lay smoking on the trojan plain then at atrides haughty foot were laid the wealth i gathered and the spoil i made
what fruit remains and with the untasted food supplies her care i sack twelve ample city on the main your mighty monarch these in peace possess some few my soldiers had himself the rest
some present too to every prince was paid and every prince enjoys the gift he made i only must refund of all his train see what pre eminence our merits gain
his greedy soul delights my spouse alone must bless his lustful night the woman let him as he may enjoy but what the quarrel then of greece to troy
my spoil alone what to these shore the assembled nation draws what calls for vengeance but a woman cause are fair endowments and a beauteous face
beloved by none but those of atreus race the wife whom choice and passion doth approve sure every wise_nestor and worthy man will love
nor did my fair one less distinction claim slave as she was my soul adored the dame wrong in my love all proffers i disdain deceived for once i trust not king again
ye have my answer what remains to do your king ulysses may consult with you what needs he the defence this arm can make
has he not wall no human force can shake has he not fenced his guarded navy round with piles with ramparts and a trench profound
and will not these the wonders he has done repel the rage of priam single son there was a time twas when for greece i fought
when stern_hector prowess no such wonders wrought he kept the verge of troy nor dared to wait achilles fury at the scaean gate he tried it once and scarce was saved by fate
but now those ancient enmities are er to morrow we the favouring god implore then shall you see our parting vessel crown and hear with oars the hellespont resound
the third day hence shall pthia greet our sails if mighty neptune send propitious gales pthia to her achilles shall restore the wealth he left for this detested shore
the ruddy gold the steel and shining brass my beauteous captives thither i ll convey and all that rests of my unravish prey
thither the spoil of this long war shall pass one only valued gift your tyrant gave and that resumed the fair lyrnessian slave
then tell him loud that all the greeks may hear and learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear for arm in impudence mankind he braves and meditates new cheats on all his slaves though shameless as he is to face these eye is what he dares not if he dares he dies tell him all terms all commerce i decline nor share his council nor his battle join for once deceiv was his but twice were mine

though bribes were heap on bribes in number more than dust in field or sands along the shore should all these offers for my friendship call tis he that offers and i scorn them all
atrides daughter never shall be led an ill match consort to achilles bed like golden venus though she charm the heart and vied with pallas in the work of art some greater greek let those high nuptials grace i hate alliance with a tyrant race
if heaven restore me to my realm with life the reverend peleus shall elect my wife thessalian nymphs there are of form divine and king that sue to mix their blood with mine
bless in kind love my year shall glide away content with just hereditary sway there deaf for ever to the martial strife enjoy the dear prerogative of life
no let the stupid prince whom which_jove deprives of sense and justice run where frenzy drives not all proud life is not to be bought with heap of gold
not all apollo pythian treasures hold or troy once held in peace and pride of sway can bribe the poor possession of a day
lost herds and treasures we by arm regain and steed unrivall on the dusty plain but from our lips the vital spirit fled return no more to wake the silent dead
my fate long since by thetis were disclosed and each alternate life or fame proposed here if i stay before the trojan town short is my date but deathless my renown if i return i quit immortal praise for year on year and long extended day
convinced though late i find my fond mistake and warn the greeks the wiser choice to make to quit these shore their native seat enjoy nor hope the fall of heaven defended troy

they pass on with success kill rhesus with several of his officers and seize the famous horse of that prince with which they return in triumph to the camp
all night the chief before their vessel lay and lost in sleep the labour of the day all but the king with various thought oppress
as when by lightnings which_jove ethereal power foretels the rattling hail or weighty shower or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore or bids the brazen throat of war to roar by fits one flash succeeds as one expires and heaven flame thick with momentary fire
the same night continues the scene lies in the two camp his country care lay rolling in his breast so bursting frequent from atrides breast sighs following sighs his inward fear confess
now er the field dejected he surveys from thousand trojan fire the mounting blaze hears in the passing wind their music blow and marks distinct the voice of the foe
he rends his hair in sacrifice to which_jove and sues to him that ever life above inly he groans while glory and despair divide his heart and wage a double war
a thousand care his labouring breast revolves to seek sage wise_nestor now the chief resolves with him in wholesome counsel to debate what yet remains to save the afflicted state
he rose and first he cast his mantle round next on his foot the shining sandals bound a lion yellow spoil
now looking backwards to the fleet and coast anxious he sorrow for the endangered host his back conceal his warlike hand a pointed javelin held
alike denied the gift of soft repose laments for greece that in his cause before so much had suffer and must suffer more
a brazen helmet glitter on his head thus with a javelin in his hand he went to wake atrides in the royal tent
meanwhile his brother press with equal woe a leopard spotted hide his shoulder spread already waked atrides he descried his armour buckling at his vessel side
joyful they met the spartan thus begun why puts my brother his bright armour on sends he some spy amidst these silent hour to try yon camp and watch the trojan power
but say what hero shall sustain that task such bold exploits uncommon courage ask guideless alone through night dark shade to go and midst a hostile camp explore the foe
to whom the king in such distress we stand no vulgar counsel our affairs demand greece to preserve is now no easy part but asks high wisdom deep design and art
witness or what ear believed in one great day by one great arm achieved such wondrous deed as stern_hector hand has done and we beheld the last revolving sun
for which_jove averse our humble prayer denies and bow his head to stern_hector sacrifice what eye has what honour the beloved of which_jove adorn
sprung from no god and of no goddess born yet such his acts as greeks unborn shall tell and curse the battle where their father fell
now speed thy hasty course along the fleet there call great oilean_ajax and the prince of crete ourself to hoary wise_nestor will repair to keep the guards on duty be his care for wise_nestor influence best that quarter guides whose son with merion
er the watch presides to whom the spartan these thy order borne say shall i stay or with despatch return
there shall thou stay the king of man replied else may we miss to meet without a guide the paths so many and the camp so wide
still with your voice the slothful soldiers raise urge by their father fame their future praise forget we now our state and lofty birth not titles here but work must prove our worth
to labour is the lot of man below and when which_jove gave us life he gave us woe this said each parted to his several care
the king to wise_nestor sable ship repairs the sage protector of the greeks he found stretch in his bed with all his arm around the various colour scarf the shield he rears the shining helmet and the pointed spear the dreadful weapon of the warrior rage that old in arm disdain the peace of age
then leaning on his hand his watchful head the hoary monarch raised his eye and said what art thou speak that on designs unknown while other sleep thus range the camp alone
seek st thou some friend or nightly sentinel stand off approach not but thy purpose tell son of neleus thus the king rejoin
lo here the wretched agamemnon stands the unhappy general of the grecian band whom which_jove decrees with daily care to bend and woe that only with his life shall end
pride of the greeks and glory of thy kind scarce can my knees these trembling limb sustain and scarce my heart support its load of pain
no taste of sleep these heavy eye have known confused and sad i wander thus alone with fear distracted with no fix design and all my people miseries are mine
if aught of use thy waking thought suggest since care like mine deprive thy soul of rest impart thy counsel and assist thy friend now let us jointly to the trench descend
tired with the toil of day and watch of night else may the sudden foe our work invade so near and favour by the gloomy shade
at every gate the fainting guard excite to him thus wise_nestor trust the power above nor think proud stern_hector hope confirm by which_jove
audacious stern_hector if the god ordain that great achilles rise and rage again what toil attend thee and what woe remain
how ill agree the view of vain mankind and the wise_nestor counsel of the eternal mind lo faithful wise_nestor thy command obeys
the care is next our other chief to raise ulysses diomed we chiefly need meges for strength oileus famed for speed
some other be despatch of nimbler foot to those tall ship remotest of the fleet where lie great oilean_ajax and the king of crete
i myself decree dear as he is to us and dear to thee yet must i tax his sloth that claims no share with his great brother in his martial care
him it behoved to every chief to sue preventing every part perform by you for strong necessity our toil demands claims all our heart and urges all our hand
to whom the king with reverence we allow thy just rebukes yet learn to spare them now my generous brother is of gentle kind he seems remiss but bears a valiant mind through too much deference to our sovereign sway content to follow when we lead the way but now our ills industrious to prevent long ere the rest he rose and sought my tent
the chief you named already at his call prepare to meet us near the navy wall assembling there between the trench and gate
to rouse the spartan near the night guards our chosen council waits then none said wise_nestor shall his rule withstand
the shining greaves his manly legs enclose his purple mantle golden buckles join warm with the softest wool and doubly lined
for great examples justify command with that the venerable warrior rose then rushing from his tent he snatch in haste his steely lance that lighten as he pass
the camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd stopp at ulysses tent and call aloud ulysses sudden as the voice was sent awakes starts up and issues from his tent
what new distress what sudden cause of fright thus leads you wandering in the silent night prudent chief
wise_nestor as thou art be now thy wisdom tried whatever means of safety can be sought whatever counsel can inspire our thought whatever methods or to fly or fight all all depend on this important night
the pylian sage replied he heard return and took his painted shield then join the chief and follow through the field
without his tent bold diomed they found all sheathed in arm his brave companions round each sunk in sleep extended on the field his head reclining on his bossy shield
a wood of spear stood by that fix upright shot from their flashing point a quivering light a bull black hide composed the hero bed
a splendid carpet roll beneath his head then with his foot old wise_nestor gently shakes the slumbering chief and in these word awakes rise son of tydeus
to the brave and strong rest seems inglorious and the night too long but sleep st thou now when from yon hill the foe hangs er the fleet and shade our wall below
at this soft slumber from his eyelids fled the warrior saw the hoary chief and said wondrous old man whose soul no respite knows though year and honour bid thee seek repose let younger greeks
my friend he answered generous is thy care these toil my subjects and my son might bear their loyal thought and pious love conspire to ease a sovereign and relieve a sire
but now the last despair surrounds our host no hour must pass no moment must be lost each single greek in this conclusive strife stands on the sharpest edge of death or life
yet if my year thy kind regard engage employ thy youth as i employ my age succeed to these my care and rouse the rest he serves me most who serves his country best
this said the hero er his shoulder flung a lion spoil that to his ankles hung then seized his ponderous lance and strode along
our sleeping warrior wake ill fits thy age these toil to undertake meges the bold with oilean_ajax famed for speed the warrior roused and to the entrenchments lead
and now the chief approach the nightly guard a wakeful squadron each in arm prepared the unwearied watch their listening leader keep and couching close repel invading sleep
with toil protected from the prowling train when the gaunt lioness with hunger bold spring from the mountain toward the guarded fold through breaking wood her rustling course they hear loud and more loud the clamours strike their ear of hounds and man they start they gaze around
thus watch the grecians cautious of surprise each voice each motion drew their ear and eye each step of passing foot increased the affright and hostile troy was ever full in sight
so faithful dog their fleecy charge maintain watch every side and turn to every sound wise_nestor with joy the wakeful band survey and thus accosted through the gloomy shade
tis well my son your nightly care employ else must our host become the scorn of troy watch thus and greece shall live
the hero said then er the trench the following chieftains led his son and godlike merion march behind for these the prince to their council join
a place there was yet undefiled with gore the spot where stern_hector stopp his rage before when night descending from his vengeful hand reprieved the relics of the grecian band
the trenches pass the assembled king around in silent state the consistory crown the plain beside with mangled corps was spread and all his progress mark by heap of dead
there sat the mournful king when neleus son the council opening in these word begun is there said he a chief so greatly brave his life to hazard and his country save
life there a man who singly dares to go to yonder camp or seize some straggling foe or favour by the night approach so near their speech their counsel and designs to hear
this could he learn and to our peers recite and pass unharm the danger of the night what fame were his through all succeeding day while phoebus shines or man have tongues to praise
if to besiege our navy they prepare or troy once more must be the seat of war what gift his grateful country would bestow
a sable ewe each leader should provide with each a sable lambkin by her side at every rite his share should be increased and his the foremost honour of the feast
what must not greece to her deliverer owe fear held them mute alone untaught to fear tydides spoke the man you seek is here
through yon black camp to bend my dangerous way some god within command and i obey but let some other chosen warrior join to raise my hope and second my design
by mutual confidence and mutual aid great deed are done and great discoveries made the wise_nestor new prudence from the wise_nestor acquire and one brave hero fans another fire
contending leader at the word arose each generous breast with emulation glows so brave a task each oilean_ajax strove to share bold merion strove and wise_nestor valiant heir the spartan wish the second place to gain and great ulysses wish nor wish in vain
thou first of warrior and thou best of friend undaunted diomed what chief to join in this great enterprise is only thine
then thus the king of man the contest ends just be thy choice without affection made to birth or office no respect be paid let worth determine here
the monarch spake and inly trembled for his brother sake then thus the godlike diomed rejoin my choice declares the impulse of my mind
a chief whose safety is minerva care so famed so dreadful in the work of war bless in his conduct i no aid require wisdom like his might pass through flame of fire
how can i doubt while great ulysses stands to lend his counsel and assist our hand it fits thee not before these chief of fame
replied the sage to praise me or to blame praise from a friend or censure from a foe are lost on hearers that our merits know
the reddening orient shows the coming day the stars shine fainter on the ethereal plain and of night empire but a third remains
but let us haste night rolls the hour away thus having spoke with generous ardour press in arm terrific their huge limb
then in a leathern helm he cased his head short of its crest and with no plume erspread such as by youth unused to arm are worn
they dress a two edged falchion thrasymed the brave and ample buckler to tydides gave no spoil enrich it and no studs adorn
next him ulysses took a shining sword a bow and quiver with bright arrow stored a well proved casque with leather braces bound thy gift meriones his temples crown soft wool within without in order spread
this from amyntor rich ormenus son autolycus by fraudful rapine won and gave amphidamas from him the prize molus received the pledge of social ties the helmet next by merion was possess
a boar white teeth grinn horrid er his head and now ulysses thoughtful temples press thus sheathed in arm the council they forsake and dark through paths oblique their progress take
just then in sign she favour their intent a long wing heron great minerva sent this though surrounding shade obscured their view
ulysses pray hail the glad omen and address the maid daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
by the shrill clang and whistling wing they knew as from the right she soar o thou for ever present in my way who all my motions all my toil survey
safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade safe by thy succour to our ship convey and let some deed this signal night adorn to claim the tear of trojans yet unborn
then godlike diomed preferr his prayer daughter of which_jove unconquer pallas hear great queen of arm whose favour tydeus won
when on ćsopus banks the banded power of greece he left and sought the theban tower peace was his charge received with peaceful show he went a legate but return a foe
as thou defend st the sire defend the son then help by thee and cover by thy shield he fought with number and made number yield
a youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke untamed unconscious of the galling yoke with ample forehead and with spreading horns whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns
so now be present celestial maid so still continue to the race thine aid the hero pray and pallas from the sky
now like two lion panting for the prey with dreadful thought they trace the dreary way through the black horror of the ensanguined plain through dust through blood er arm and hill of slain
nor less bold stern_hector and the son of troy on high designs the wakeful hour employ the assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed who thus the counsel of his breast proposed what glorious man for high attempts prepared dares greatly venture for a rich reward
accords their vow succeeds their enterprise of yonder fleet a bold discovery make what watch they keep and what resolves they take
his be the chariot that shall please him most of all the plunder of the vanquish host his the fair steed that all the rest excel and his the glory to have served so well
a youth there was among the tribes of troy dolon his name eumedes only boy five girls beside the reverend herald told
rich was the son in brass and rich in gold not bless by nature with the charm of face but swift of foot and matchless in the race
if now subdued they meditate their flight and spent with toil neglect the watch of night stern_hector he said my courage bids me meet this high achievement and explore the fleet
but first exalt thy sceptre to the sky and swear to grant me the demanded prize the immortal courser and the glittering car that bear pelides through the rank of war
encouraged thus no idle scout i go fulfil thy wish their whole intention know even to the royal tent pursue my way and all their counsel all their aims betray
the chief then heaved the golden sceptre high attesting thus the monarch of the sky be witness thou immortal lord of all
whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall by none but dolon shall this prize be borne and him alone the immortal steed adorn
across his back the bended bow he flung a wolf grey hide around his shoulder hung a ferret downy fur his helmet lined
thus stern_hector swore the god were call in vain but the rash youth prepares to scour the plain and in his hand a pointed javelin shined
then never to return he sought the shore and trod the path his foot must tread no more scarce had he pass the steed and trojan throng still bending forward as he coursed along
i hear some step of hostile foot moving this way or hastening to the fleet some spy perhaps to lurk beside the main or nightly pillager that strips the slain
when on the hollow way the approaching tread ulysses mark and thus to diomed friend yet let him pass and win a little space then rush behind him and prevent his pace
but if too swift of foot he fly before confine his course along the fleet and shore betwixt the camp and him
with that they stepp aside and stoop their head as dolon pass behind a heap of dead along the path the spy unwary flew soft at just distance both the chief pursue
so distant they and such the space between as when two teams of mules divide the green to whom the hind like shares of land allows
now dolon listening heard them as they pass stern_hector he thought had sent and check his haste till scarce at distance of a javelin throw no voice succeeding he perceived the foe
as when two skilful hounds the leveret wind or chase through wood obscure the trembling hind now lost now seen they intercept his way and from the herd still turn the flying prey so fast and with such fear the trojan flew so close so constant
our spear employ and intercept his hoped return to troy when now new furrows part the approaching ploughs the bold greeks pursue
now almost on the fleet the dastard fall and mingles with the guards that watch the wall when brave tydides stopp a gen rous thought inspired by pallas in his bosom wrought
lest on the foe some forward greek advance and snatch the glory from his lifted lance then thus aloud whoe er thou art remain this javelin else shall fix thee to the plain
he said and high in air the weapon cast which wilful err and er his shoulder pass then fix in earth
against the trembling wood the wretch stood propp and quiver as he stood a sudden palsy seized his turning head his loose teeth
chatter and his colour fled the panting warrior seize him as he stands and with unmanly tear his life demands
o spare my youth and for the breath i owe large gift of price my father shall bestow vast heap of brass shall in your ship be told and steel well temper and refulgent gold
to whom ulysses made this wise_nestor reply whoe er thou art be bold nor fear to die what moves thee say when sleep has closed the sight to roam the silent field in dead of night
cam st thou the secrets of our camp to find by stern_hector prompted or thy daring mind or art some wretch by hope of plunder led through heap of carnage to despoil the dead
then thus pale dolon with a fearful look still as he spoke his limb with horror shook hither i came by stern_hector word deceived much did he promise
those swift steed that sweep the rank of war urged me unwilling this attempt to make to learn what counsel what resolves you take if now subdued you fix your hope on flight
rashly i believed no less a bribe than great achilles car and and tired with toil neglect the watch of night
bold was thy aim and glorious was the prize ulysses with a scornful smile replies far other rulers those proud steed demand and scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand
even great achilles scarce their rage can tame achilles sprung from an immortal dame but say be faithful and the truth recite
where lies encamp the trojan chief to night where stand his courser in what quarter sleep their other prince tell what watch they keep
say since this conquest what their counsel are or here to combat from their city far or back to ilion wall transfer the war
ulysses thus and thus eumedes son what dolon knows his faithful tongue shall own stern_hector the peers assembling in his tent a council holds at ilus monument
no certain guards the nightly watch partake where er yon fire ascend the trojans wake anxious for troy the guard the natives keep
safe in their care the auxiliar force sleep whose wife and infant from the danger far discharge their soul of half the fear of war
to whom the spy their power they thus dispose the paeons dreadful with their bended bow the carians caucons the pelasgian host and leleges encamp along the coast
then sleep those aid among the trojan train inquired the chief or scattered er the plain not distant far lie higher on the land
these troy but lately to her succour won led on by rhesus great eioneus son i saw his courser in proud triumph go swift as the wind and white as winter snow rich silver plates his shining car infold his solid arm refulgent flame with gold no mortal shoulder suit the glorious load celestial panoply to grace a god
the lycian mysian and maeonian band and phrygia horse by thymbras ancient wall the thracians utmost and apart from all let me unhappy to your fleet be borne or leave me here a captive fate to mourn
to this tydides with a gloomy frown think not to live though all the truth be shown shall we dismiss thee in some future strife
in cruel chains till your return reveal the truth or falsehood of the news i tell to risk more bravely thy now forfeit life
sternly he spoke and as the wretch prepared with humble blandishment to stroke his beard like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew divides the neck and cuts the nerves in two
or that again our camp thou may st explore no once a traitor thou betray st no more one instant snatch his trembling soul to hell the head yet speaking
mutter as it fell the furry helmet from his brow they tear the wolf grey hide the unbended bow and spear
these great ulysses lifting to the sky to favouring pallas dedicates the prize great queen of arm receive this hostile spoil and let the thracian steed reward our toil
this said the spoil with dropping gore defaced high on a spreading tamarisk he placed then heap with reeds and gathered boughs the plain to guide their footsteps to the place again
through the still night they cross the devious field slippery with blood er arm and heap of shield arriving where the thracian squadrons lay and eased in sleep the labour of the day
thee first of all the heavenly host we praise speed our labour and direct our way ranged in three line they view the prostrate band the horse yoked beside each warrior stand
their arm in order on the ground reclined through the brown shade the fulgid weapon shined amidst lay rhesus stretch in sleep profound
and the white steed behind his chariot bound the welcome sight ulysses first descries and point to diomed the tempting prize
now thy courage try approach the chariot and the steed untie or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deed urge thou the slaughter while i seize the steed
the man the courser and the car behold described by dolon with the arm of gold now brave tydides
pallas this said her hero bosom warms breathed in his heart and strung his nervous arm where er he pass a purple stream pursued his thirsty falchion fat with hostile blood bathed all his footsteps dyed the field with gore and a low groan
so the grim lion from his nightly den erleaps the fences and invades the pen on sheep or goats resistless in his way he fall and foaming rends the guardless prey nor stopp the fury of his vengeful hand till twelve lay breathless of the thracian band
ulysses following as his partner slew back by the foot each slaughter warrior drew the milk white courser studious to convey safe to the ship he wisely cleared the way
remurmur through the shore lest the fierce steed not yet to battle bred should start and tremble at the heap of dead
now twelve despatch the monarch last they found tydides falchion fix him to the ground just then a deathful dream minerva sent a warlike form appear before his tent whose visionary steel his bosom tore
ulysses now the snowy steed detains and leads them fasten by the silver rein these with his bow unbent he lash along the scourge forgot on rhesus chariot hung then gave his friend the signal to retire
but him new danger new achievements fire doubtful he stood or with his reeking blade to send more hero to the infernal shade drag off the car where rhesus armour lay or heave with manly force and lift away
while unresolved the son of tydeus stands pallas appears and thus her chief command enough my son from further slaughter cease regard thy safety and depart in peace haste to the ship the gotten spoil enjoy nor tempt too far the hostile god of troy
so dream the monarch and awaked no more the voice divine confess the martial maid in haste he mounted and her word obey d
not unobserved they pass the god of light had watch his troy and mark minerva flight saw tydeus son with heavenly succour
the courser fly before ulysses bow swift as the wind and white as winter snow bless and vengeful anger fill his sacred breast
swift to the trojan camp descends the power and wakes hippocoon in the morning hour on rhesus side accustom to attend a faithful kinsman and instructive friend
he rose and saw the field deform with blood an empty space where late the courser stood the yet warm thracians panting on the coast for each he wept but for his rhesus most now while on rhesus name he calls in vain the gathering tumult spreads er all the plain on heap the trojans rush with wild affright and wondering view the slaughter of the night
meanwhile the chief arriving at the shade where late the spoil of stern_hector spy were laid ulysses stopp to him tydides bore the trophy dropping yet with dolon gore then mounts again again their nimbler foot
the courser ply and thunder towards the fleet illustration diomed and ulysses returning with the spoil of rhesus diomed and ulysses returning with the spoil of rhesus
methinks the noise of trampling steed i hear thickening this way and gathering on my ear perhaps some horse of the trojan breed so may ye god
old wise_nestor first perceived the approaching sound bespeaking thus the grecian peers around my pious hope succeed the great tydides and ulysses bear return triumphant with this prize of war
yet much i fear ah may that fear be vain the chief outnumber by the trojan train perhaps even now pursued they seek the shore or oh
the chief appear and spring to earth the greeks dismiss their fear with word of friendship and extended hand they greet the king and wise_nestor first demands
perhaps those hero are no more scarce had he spoke when lo say thou whose praise all our host proclaim thou living glory of the grecian name
say whence these courser by what chance bestow the spoil of foe or present of a god not those fair steed so radiant and so gay
that draw the burning chariot of the day old as i am to age i scorn to yield and daily mingle in the martial field
but sure till now no courser struck my sight like these conspicuous through the rank of fight some god i deem conferred the glorious prize bless as ye are and favourites of the sky
the care of him who bids the thunder roar and her whose fury bathes the world with gore father not so sage ithacus rejoin
of thracian lineage are the steed ye view whose hostile king the brave tydides slew sleeping he died with all his guards around and twelve beside lay gasping on the ground
these other spoil from conquer dolon came a wretch whose swiftness was his only fame by stern_hector sent our force to explore he now lies headless on the sandy shore
the gift of heaven are of a nobler kind then er the trench the bounding courser flew the joyful greeks with loud acclaim pursue
straight to tydides high pavilion borne the matchless steed his ample stalls adorn the neighing courser their new fellows greet and the full racks are heap with generous wheat
but dolon armour to his ship convey high on the painted stern_hector ulysses laid a trophy destin to the blue eyed maid
then in the polished bath refresh from toil their joints they supple with dissolving oil in due repast indulge the genial hour and first to pallas
now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain they cleanse their body in the neighb ring main the libations pour they sit rejoicing in her aid divine and the crown goblet foams with flood of wine
agamemnon having armed himself leads the grecians to battle stern_hector prepares the trojans to receive them while jupiter juno and minerva give the signals of war
agamemnon bears all before him and stern_hector is commanded by jupiter who sends iris for that purpose to decline the engagement till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field
ulysses and diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter being wounded by paris is obliged to desert his companion who is encompassed by the trojans wounded and in the utmost danger till great_menelaus and oilean_ajax rescue him
book xi argument the third battle and the acts of agamemnon he then makes a great slaughter of the enemy stern_hector comes against oilean_ajax but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the greeks
in the meantime machaon in the other wing of the army is pierced with an arrow by paris and carried from the fight in wise_nestor chariot
achilles who overlooked the action from his ship sent patroclus to inquire which of the greeks was wounded in that manner wise_nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day and a long recital of some former war which he remembered tending to put patroclus upon persuading achilles to fight for his countrymen or at least to permit him to do it clad in achilles armour
this book opens with the eight and twentieth day of the poem and the same day with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and part of the eighteenth book
patroclus on his return meets eurypylus also wounded and assists him in that distress the scene lies in the field near the monument of ilus
now rose refulgent from tithonus bed with new born day to gladden mortal sight and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light when baleful eris sent by which_jove command the torch of discord blazing in her hand through the red sky her bloody sign extends
the saffron morn with early blushes spread and wrapt in tempests er the fleet descends high on ulysses bark her horrid stand
even oilean_ajax and achilles heard the sound whose ship remote the guarded navy bound thence the black fury through the grecian throng
with horror sound the loud orthian song the navy shakes and at the dire alarm each bosom boils each warrior starts to arm
she took and thunder through the sea and land no more they sigh inglorious to return but breathe revenge and for the combat burn
illustration the descent of discord the descent of discord the king of man his hardy host inspires with loud command with great example fire
and first he cased his manly legs around in shining greaves with silver buckles bound the beaming cuirass next adorn his breast the same which once king cinyras
possess the fame of greece and her assembled host had reach that monarch on the cyprian coast twas then the friendship of the chief to gain this glorious gift he sent nor sent in vain
ten rows of azure steel the work infold twice ten of tin and twelve of ductile gold three glittering dragons to the gorget rise
himself first rose himself before the rest his mighty limb in radiant armour dress whose imitated scales against the sky reflected various light and arching bow like colour rainbows er a showery cloud
a radiant baldric er his shoulder tied sustain the sword that glitter at his side gold was the hilt a silver sheath encased the shining blade and golden hangers graced
which_jove wondrous bow of three celestial dies placed as a sign to man amidst the sky his buckler mighty orb was next
that round the warrior cast a dreadful shade ten zones of brass its ample brim surround and twice ten bosses the bright convex crown
tremendous gorgon frown upon its field and circling terror fill the expressive shield within its concave hung a silver thong on which a mimic serpent creeps along his azure length in easy wave extends till in three head the embroider monster ends
last er his brows his fourfold helm he placed with nodding horse hair formidably graced and in his hand two steely javelin wields that blaze to heaven and lighten all the field
that instant juno and the martial maid in happy thunder promised greece their aid high er the chief they clash their arm in air and leaning from the cloud expect the war
close to the limits of the trench and mound the fiery courser to their chariot bound the squires restrain the foot with those who wield the lighter arm rush forward to the field
display to second these in close array combined the squadrons spread their sable wing behind now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun as with the light the warrior toil begun
even which_jove whose thunder spoke his wrath distill red drops of blood er all the fatal field the woe of man unwilling to survey and all the slaughter that must stain the day
near ilus tomb in order ranged around the trojan line possess the rising ground there wise_nestor polydamas and stern_hector stood ćneas honour as a guardian god bold polybus agenor the divine the brother warrior of antenor line
with youthful acamas whose beauteous face and fair proportion match the ethereal race great stern_hector cover with his spacious shield plies all the troop and order all the field
as the red star now shows his sanguine fire through the dark cloud and now in night retires thus through the rank
appear the godlike man plunged in the rear or blazing in the van while streamy sparkles restless as he fly flash from his arm as lightning from the sky
as sweating reapers in some wealthy field ranged in two band their crooked weapon wield bear down the furrows till their labour meet thick fall the heapy harvests at their foot
so greece and troy the field of war divide and falling rank are strow on every side none stoop a thought to base inglorious flight
but horse to horse and man to man they fight not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey each wound each bleeds but none resign the day
discord alone of all the immortal train swells the red horror of this direful plain the god in peace their golden mansions fill ranged in bright order on the olympian hill
discord with joy the scene of death descries and drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eye but general murmurs told their grief above and each accused the partial will of which_jove
meanwhile apart superior and alone the eternal monarch on his awful throne wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate and fix fulfill the just decrees of fate
on earth he turn his all considering eye and mark the spot where ilion tower arise the sea with ship the field with army spread the victor rage the dying and the dead
thus while the morning beams increasing bright er heaven pure azure spread the glowing light commutual death the fate of war confounds each adverse battle gored with equal wound
but now what time in some sequester vale the weary woodman spreads his sparing meal when his tired arm refuse the axe to rear and claim a respite from the sylvan war but not till half the prostrate forests lay stretch in long ruin and exposed to day
great agamemnon then the slaughter led and slew bienor at his people head whose squire oileus with a sudden spring leap from the chariot to revenge his king but in his front he felt the fatal wound which pierced his brain and stretch him on the ground
then nor till then the greeks impulsive might pierced the black phalanx and let in the light atrides spoil and left them on the plain vain was their youth
their glittering armour vain now soil with dust and naked to the sky their snowy limb and beauteous body lie two son of priam next to battle move the product one of marriage one of love
in the same car the brother warrior ride this took the charge to combat that to guide far other task than when they wont to keep on ida tops their father fleecy sheep
these on the mountain once achilles found and captive led with pliant osiers bound then to their sire for ample sums restored but now to perish by atrides sword pierced in the breast the base born isus bleeds
cleft through the head his brother fate succeeds swift to the spoil the hasty victor fall and stript their features to his mind recalls
the trojans see the youth untimely die but helpless tremble for themselves and fly so when a lion ranging er the lawns
finds on some grassy lair the couching fawns their bones he cracks their reeking vitals draws and grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws the frighted hind beholds and dares not stay but swift through rustling thickets bursts her way all drown in sweat the panting mother fly and the big tear roll trickling from her eye
amidst the tumult of the routed train the son of false antimachus were slain he who for bribes his faithless counsel sold and voted argive_helen stay for paris gold
atrides mark as these their safety sought and slew the children for the father fault their headstrong horse unable to restrain they shook with fear and dropp the silken rein then in the chariot on their knees they fall and thus with lifted hand for mercy call spare our youth and for the life we owe antimachus shall copious gift bestow soon as he hears that not in battle slain the grecian ship his captive son detain large heap of brass in ransom shall be told and steel well tempered and persuasive gold
these word attended with the flood of tear the youth address to unrelenting ear the vengeful monarch gave this stern_hector reply if from antimachus ye spring ye die the daring wretch who once in council stood to shed ulysses and my brother blood for proffer peace and sues his seed for grace
no die and pay the forfeit of your race this said pisander from the car he cast and pierced his breast supine he breathed his last
his brother leap to earth but as he lay the trenchant falchion lopp his hand away his sever head was toss among the throng and rolling drew a bloody train along
then where the thickest fought the victor flew the king example all his greeks pursue now by the foot the flying foot were slain horse trod by horse lay foaming on the plain
the brass hoof steed tumultuous plunge and bound and the thick thunder beats the labouring ground still slaughtering on the king of man proceeds the distanced army wonders at his deed as when the wind with raging flame conspire and er the forests roll the flood of fire
in blazing heap the grove old honour fall and one refulgent ruin levels all before atrides rage so sinks the foe whole squadrons vanish and proud head lie low
the steed fly trembling from his waving sword and many a car now lighted of its lord wide er the field with guideless fury rolls breaking their rank and crushing out their soul while his keen falchion drinks the warrior life more grateful now to vultures than their wife
from the dry field thick cloud of dust arise shade the black host and intercept the sky perhaps great stern_hector then had found his fate but which_jove and destiny prolong his date
safe from the dart the care of heaven he stood amidst alarm and death and dust and blood now past the tomb where ancient ilus lay through the mid field the routed urge their way
where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown the path they take and speed to reach the town as swift atrides with loud shouts pursued hot with his toil and bathed in hostile blood
now near the beech tree and the scaean gate the hero halts and his associates waits meanwhile on every side around the plain dispersed disorder fly the trojan train
the lion roaring through the midnight shade on heap they tumble with successless haste the savage seizes draws and rends the last
so fly a herd of beeves that hear dismay not with less fury stern_hector atrides flew still press the rout and still the hindmost slew
hurl from their car the bravest chief are kill and rage and death and carnage load the field now storm the victor at the trojan wall surveys the tower and meditates their fall
but which_jove descending shook the idaean hill and down their summits pour a hundred rills the unkindled lightning in his hand he took and thus the many coloured maid bespoke iris with haste thy golden wing display to godlike stern_hector this our word convey
fight in the front and bathes with blood the ground bid him give way but issue forth command and trust the war to less important hand
but when or wounded by the spear or dart that chief shall mount his chariot and depart then which_jove shall string his arm and fire his breast then to her ship shall flying greece be press
while agamemnon wastes the rank around till to the main the burning sun descend and sacred night her awful shade extend
he spoke and iris at his word obey on wing of wind descends the various maid the chief she found amidst the rank of war close to the bulwarks on his glittering car
while agamemnon wastes the rank around fight in the front and bathes with blood the ground abstain from fight yet issue forth command and trust the war to less important hand but when or wounded by the spear or dart the chief shall mount his chariot and depart then which_jove shall string thy arm and fire thy breast then to her ship shall flying greece be press
the goddess then son of priam hear from which_jove i come and his high mandate bear till to the main the burning sun descend and sacred night her awful shade extend
she said and vanish stern_hector with a bound spring from his chariot on the trembling ground in clanging arm he grasps in either hand
a pointed lance and speeds from band to band revives their ardour turns their steps from flight and wakes anew the dying flame of fight
new force new spirit to each breast return the fight renew with fiercer fury burns the king leads on all fix on him their eye and learn from him to conquer or to die
they stand to arm the greeks their onset dare condense their power and wait the coming war ye sacred nine celestial muses
tell who faced him first and by his prowess fell the great iphidamas the bold and young from sage antenor and theano sprung
scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest and early honour warm his generous breast when the kind sire consign his daughter charm theano sister to his youthful arm
but call by glory to the war of troy he leaves untasted the first fruits of joy from his loved bride departs with melting eye and swift to aid his dearer country fly
whom from his youth his grandsire cisseus bred and nursed in thrace where snowy flocks are fed with twelve black ship
he reach percope strand thence took the long laborious march by land now fierce for fame before the rank he spring towering in arm and braves the king of king
atrides first discharged the missive spear the trojan stoop the javelin pass in air then near the corslet at the monarch heart with all his strength the youth directs his dart
but the broad belt with plates of silver bound the point rebated and repell the wound encumber with the dart atrides stands till grasp with force he wrench d
it from his hand at once his weighty sword discharged a wound full on his neck that fell him to the ground
stretch in the dust the unhappy warrior lies and sleep eternal seals his swimming eye oh worthy better fate oh early slain
thy country friend and virtuous though in vain no more the youth shall join his consort side at once a virgin and at once a bride
no more with presents her embraces meet or lay the spoil of conquest at her foot on whom his passion lavish of his store bestow so much and vainly promised more
unwept uncover on the plain he lay while the proud victor bore his arm away coon antenor eldest hope was nigh
tear at the sight came starting from his eye while pierced with grief the much loved youth he view and the pale features now deform with blood
then with his spear unseen his time he took aim at the king and near his elbow strook the thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part and through his arm stood forth the barbed dart
on coon rushes with his lifted spear his brother corpse the pious trojan draws and calls his country to assert his cause defends him breathless on the sanguine field and er the body spreads his ample shield
atrides marking an unguarded part transfix the warrior with his brazen dart prone on his brother bleeding breast he lay the monarch falchion lopp d
surprised the monarch feels yet void of fear his head away the social shade the same dark journey go and join each other in the realm below
with every weapon art or fury yields by the long lance the sword or ponderous stone whole rank are broken and whole troop erthrown
this while yet warm distill the purple flood but when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend less keen those dart
the vengeful victor rage round the field the fierce ilythiae send the power that cause the teeming matron throes sad mother of unutterable woe
stung with the smart all panting with the pain he mounts the car and gives his squire the rein then with a voice which fury made more strong and pain augmented thus exhorts the throng friend
o greeks assert your honour won proceed and finish what this arm begun lo angry which_jove forbids your chief to stay and envies half the glory of the day
cloud from their nostrils the fierce courser blow and from their side the foam descends in snow shot through the battle in a moment space
he said the driver whirls his lengthful thong the horse fly the chariot smokes along the wounded monarch at his tent they place
no sooner stern_hector saw the king retired but thus his trojans and his aid he fired hear all ye dardan all ye lycian race
famed in close fight and dreadful face to face now call to mind your ancient trophies won your great forefathers virtues and your own
behold the general fly deserts his power lo which_jove himself declares the conquest ours now on yon rank impel your foaming steed and sure of glory dare immortal deed
as the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear the brindled lion or the tusky bear with voice and hand provokes their doubting heart and spring the foremost with his lifted dart so godlike stern_hector prompts his troop to dare nor prompts alone but leads himself the war
on the black body of the foe he pours as from the cloud deep bosom swell with showers a sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps drives the wild wave and tosses all the deeps
with word like these the fiery chief alarm his fainting host and every bosom warms say muse when which_jove the trojan glory crown beneath his arm what hero bit the ground
assaeus dolops and autonous died opites next was added to their side then brave hipponous famed in many a fight opheltius orus sunk to endless night ćsymnus agelaus all chief of name the rest were vulgar death unknown to fame
as when a western whirlwind charged with storm dispels the gather cloud that notus form the gust continued violent and strong rolls sable cloud in heap on heap along now to the sky the foaming billows rears now breaks the surge and wide the bottom bares
now the last ruin the whole host appals now greece had trembled in her wooden wall but wise_nestor ulysses call tydides forth his soul rekindled and awaked his worth
thus raging stern_hector with resistless hand erturns confounds and scatters all their band and stand we deedless eternal shame
till stern_hector arm involve the ship in flame haste let us join and combat side by side the warrior thus and thus the friend replied
no martial toil i shun no danger fear let stern_hector come i wait his fury here but which_jove with conquest crowns the trojan train
but sighing raised his vengeful steel and from his car the proud thymbraeus fell molion the charioteer pursued his lord his death ennobled by ulysses sword
and which_jove our foe all human force is vain he sigh there slain they left them in eternal night then plunged amidst the thickest rank of fight
so two wild boars outstrip the following hounds then swift revert and wound return for wound stern_hector conquest in the middle plain stood check awhile and greece respired again
the son of merops shone amidst the war towering they rode in one refulgent car in deep prophetic art their father skill had warn his children from the trojan field
they rush to fight and perish on the plain their breast no more the vital spirit warms the stern_hector tydides strips their shining arm
fate urged them on the father warn in vain hypirochus by great ulysses dies and rich hippodamus becomes his prize great which_jove from ide with slaughter fills his sight and level hangs the doubtful scale of fight
agastrophus was slain the far famed hero of paeonian strain wing with his fear on foot he strove to fly his steed too distant and the foe too nigh through broken order swifter than the wind he fled but flying left his life behind
by tydeus lance this stern_hector sees as his experienced eye traverse the files and to the rescue fly shouts as he pass the crystal regions rend and moving army on his march attend
great diomed himself was seized with fear and thus bespoke his brother of the war mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield
swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled nor miss its aim but where the plumage danced razed the smooth cone and thence obliquely glanced
the storm rolls on and stern_hector rules the field here stand his utmost force the warrior said safe in his helm the gift of phoebus hand
his arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain er his dim sight the misty vapours rise and a short darkness shade his swimming eye
tydides followed to regain his lance while stern_hector rose recover from the trance remounts his car and herds amidst the crowd
the greek pursues him and exults aloud once more thank phoebus for thy forfeit breath or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death
without a wound the trojan hero stands but yet so stunn that staggering on the plain well by apollo are thy prayer repaid and oft that partial power has lent his aid
thou shall not long the death deserved withstand if any god assist tydides hand fly then inglorious but thy flight this day whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay him while he triumph paris eyed from far
the spouse of argive_helen the fair cause of war around the field his feather shafts he sent from ancient ilus ruin monument
behind the column placed he bent his bow and wing an arrow at the unwary foe just as he stoop agastrophus crest to seize and drew the corslet from his breast the bowstring twang nor flew the shaft in vain but pierced his foot and nail it to the plain
the laughing trojan with a joyful spring leaps from his ambush and insults the king he bleeds he cry some god has sped my dart
so troy relieved from that wide wasting hand should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand whose son now tremble at his darted spear as scatter lambs the rushing lion fear
would the same god had fix it in his heart he dauntless thus thou conqueror of the fair thou woman warrior with the curling hair vain archer
trusting to the distant dart unskill in arm to act a manly part thou hast but done what boys or women can such hand may wound but not incense a man
nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave a coward weapon never hurts the brave not so this dart which thou may st one day feel
fate wing its flight and death is on the steel where this but light some noble life expires its touch makes orphans bathes the cheeks of sire steeps earth in purple gluts the birds of air and leaves such objects as distract the fair
ulysses hastens with a trembling heart before him steps and bending draws the dart forth flows the blood an eager pang succeeds tydides mounts and to the navy speeds
now on the field ulysses stands alone the greeks all fled the trojans pouring on but stands collected in himself and whole and questions thus his own unconquer soul what further subterfuge what hope remain
what shame inglorious if i quit the plain what danger singly if i stand the ground my friend all scatter all the foe around
yet wherefore doubtful let this truth suffice the brave meets danger and the coward fly to die or conquer proves a hero heart and knowing this i know a soldier part
such thought revolving in his careful breast near and more near the shady cohorts press these in the warrior their own fate enclose and round him deep the steely circle grows
so fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds he grinds his ivory tusks he foams with ire his sanguine eye balls glare with living fire by these by those on every part is plied and the red slaughter spreads on every side
pierced through the shoulder first deiopis fell next ennomus and thoon sank to hell chersidamas beneath the navel thrust fall prone to earth and grasps the bloody dust
charops the son of hippasus was near ulysses reach him with the fatal spear but to his aid his brother socus fly socus the brave the generous and the wise_nestor
near as he drew the warrior thus began great ulysses much enduring man not deeper skill in every martial sleight than worn to toil and active in the fight
this day two brother shall thy conquest grace and end at once the great hippasian race or thou beneath this lance must press the field
he said and forceful pierced his spacious shield through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown plough half his side and bared it to the bone
by pallas care the spear though deep infix stopp short of life nor with his entrails mix the wound not mortal wise_nestor ulysses knew then furious thus but first some steps withdrew
unhappy man whose death our hand shall grace fate calls thee hence and finish is thy race nor longer check my conquest on the foe
he spoke while socus seized with sudden fright trembling gave way and turn his back to flight between his shoulder pierced the following dart and held its passage through the panting heart wide in his breast
but pierced by this to endless darkness go and add one spectre to the realm below appear the grisly wound he fall his armour rings against the ground
then thus ulysses gazing on the slain famed son of hippasus there press the plain there ends thy narrow span assign by fate heaven owes ulysses yet a longer date
no father shall thy corpse compose thy dying eye no tender mother close but hungry birds shall tear those balls away and hovering vultures scream around their prey
ah wretch me greece shall honour when i meet my doom with solemn funerals and a lasting tomb then raging with intolerable smart he writhes his body and extracts the dart
the dart a tide of spouting gore pursued and gladden troy with sight of hostile blood now troop on troop the fainting chief invade forced he recedes and loudly calls for aid
thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears the well known voice thrice great_menelaus hears alarm to oilean_ajax ajax_telamon he cried
ulysses shouts invade my ear distressed he seems and no assistance near strong as he is yet one opposed to all oppress by multitudes the best may fall
who shares his labour and defends his side friend greece robb of him must bid her host despair and feel a loss not age can repair
great oilean_ajax like the god of war attends the prudent chief in sore distress they found with band of furious trojans compass round
as when some huntsman with a flying spear from the blind thicket wound a stately deer down his cleft side while fresh the blood distils he bounds aloft and scuds from hill to hill till life warm vapour issuing through the wound wild mountain wolves the fainting beast surround just as their jaws his prostrate limb invade the lion rushes through the woodland shade the wolves though hungry scour dispersed away the lordly savage vindicates his prey
then where the cry directs his course he bends ulysses thus unconquer by his pain a single warrior half a host sustains
but soon as oilean_ajax leaves his tower like shield the scattered crowds fly frighted er the field atrides arm the sinking hero stays and saved from number to his car conveys
victorious oilean_ajax plies the routed crew and first doryclus priam son he slew on strong pandocus next inflicts a wound and lays lysander bleeding on the ground
as when a torrent swell with wintry rains pours from the mountain er the deluged plain and pines and oaks from their foundations torn a country ruin
but stern_hector from this scene of slaughter far raged on the left and ruled the tide of war loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain and deep scamander swells with heap of slain
there wise_nestor and idomeneus oppose the warrior fury there the battle glows there fierce on foot or from the chariot height his sword deforms the beauteous rank of fight
to the sea are borne fierce oilean_ajax thus erwhelms the yielding throng man steed and chariot roll in heap along the spouse of argive_helen dealing dart around had pierced machaon with a distant wound
in his right shoulder the broad shaft appear and trembling greece for her physician fear to wise_nestor then idomeneus begun glory of greece old neleus valiant son
ascend thy chariot haste with speed away and great machaon to the ship convey a wise_nestor physician skill our wound to heal is more than army to the public weal
old wise_nestor mounts the seat beside him rode the wounded offspring of the healing god he lends the lash the steed with sounding foot shake the dry field and thunder toward the fleet
but now cebriones from stern_hector car survey the various fortune of the war while here he cried the flying greeks are slain trojans on trojans yonder load the plain
before great oilean_ajax see the mingled throng of man and chariot driven in heap along i know him well distinguish o er the field
thither stern_hector thither urge thy steed there danger calls and there the combat bleeds there horse and foot in mingled death unite and groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight
thus having spoke the driver lash resounds swift through the rank the rapid chariot bounds stung by the stroke the courser scour the field er heap of carcases and hill of shield
the horse hoofs are bathed in hero gore and dashing purple all the car before the groaning axle sable drops distils and mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels
here stern_hector plunging through the thickest fight broke the dark phalanx and let in the light by the long lance the sword or ponderous stone
by the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield the rank he scatter and the troop erthrown oilean_ajax he shuns through all the dire debate and fear that arm whose force he felt so late
but partial which_jove espousing stern_hector part shot heaven bred horror through the grecian heart confused unnerved in stern_hector presence grown amazed he stood with terror not his own
thus the grim lion his retreat maintains beset with watchful dog and shouting swains repulsed by number from the nightly stalls though rage impels him and though hunger calls long stands the showering dart and missile fire then sourly slow the indignant beast retires so turn stern_hector oilean_ajax by whole host repell while his swoln heart at every step rebell
as the slow beast with heavy strength endued in some wide field by troop of boys pursued though round his side a wooden tempest rain crops the tall harvest and lays waste the plain thick on his hide the hollow blow resound
the patient animal maintains his ground scarce from the field with all their efforts chased and stirs but slowly when he stirs at last on oilean_ajax thus a weight of trojans hung the strokes redoubled on his buckler rung
confiding now in bulky strength he stands now turns and backward bears the yielding band now stiff recedes yet hardly seems to fly
o er his broad back his moony shield he threw and glaring round by tardy steps withdrew and threats his followers with retorted eye
while hissing dart descend in iron showers in his broad buckler many a weapon stood its surface bristled with a quivering wood and many a javelin guiltless on the plain marks the dry dust and thirsts for blood in vain
but bold eurypylus his aid imparts and dauntless spring beneath a cloud of dart whose eager javelin launch against the foe great apisaon felt the fatal blow from his torn liver the red current flow and his slack knees desert their dying load
the victor rushing to despoil the dead from paris bow a vengeful arrow fled fix in his nervous thigh the weapon stood fix was the point but broken was the wood
back to the line the wounded greek retired yet thus retreating his associates fired what god grecians has your heart dismay
fix as the bar between two warring power oh turn to arm tis oilean_ajax claims your aid this hour he stands the mark of hostile rage and this the last brave battle he shall wage
thus urged the chief a generous troop appears who spread their bucklers and advance their spear to guard their wounded friend while thus they stand with pious care great oilean_ajax joins the band each takes new courage at the hero sight the hero rallies and renews the fight
thus raged both army like conflicting fire while wise_nestor chariot far from fight retires his courser steep in sweat and stain with gore the greeks preserver great machaon bore
that hour achilles from the topmost height of his proud fleet erlook the field of fight his feasted eye beheld around the plain
haste join your force from the gloomy grave the warrior rescue and your country save the grecian rout the slaying and the slain
his friend machaon singled from the rest a transient pity touch his vengeful breast straight to menoetius much loved son he sent graceful as mars patroclus quits his tent
in evil hour then fate decreed his doom and fix the date of all his woe to come why calls my friend
thy loved injunctions lay whate er thy will patroclus shall obey first of friend pelides thus replied still at my heart and ever at my side
the time is come when yon despairing host shall learn the value of the man they lost now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan and proud atrides tremble on his throne
go now to wise_nestor and from him be taught what wounded warrior late his chariot brought for seen at distance and but seen behind his form recall d
machaon to my mind nor could i through yon cloud discern his face the courser pass me with so swift a pace
the hero said his friend obey with haste through intermingled ship and tent he pass the chief descending from their car he found
the warrior standing on the breezy shore to dry their sweat and wash away the gore here paused a moment while the gentle gale convey d
that freshness the cool sea exhale then to consult on farther methods went and took their seat beneath the shady tent
the panting steed eurymedon unbound the draught prescribed fair hecamede prepares arsinous daughter graced with golden hair whom to his aged arm a royal slave greece as the prize of wise_nestor wisdom gave
a table first with azure foot she placed whose ample orb a brazen charger graced honey new press the sacred flour of wheat and wholesome garlic crown the savoury treat next her white hand an antique goblet brings a goblet sacred to the pylian king from eldest time
emboss with studs of gold two foot support it and four handles hold on each bright handle bending er the brink in sculptured gold two turtles seem to drink
temper in this the nymph of form divine pours a large portion of the pramnian wine with goat milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows and last with flour the smiling surface strows
this for the wounded prince the dame prepares the cordial beverage reverend wise_nestor shares salubrious draughts the warrior thirst allay and pleasing conference beguiles the day
a massy weight yet heaved with ease by him when the brisk nectar overlook the brim meantime patroclus by achilles sent unheard approached and stood before the tent
old wise_nestor rising then the hero led to his high seat the chief refused and said tis now no season for these kind delays the great achilles with impatience stays
to great achilles this respect i owe who asks what hero wounded by the foe was borne from combat by thy foaming steed
with grief i see the great machaon bleeds this to report my hasty course i bend thou know st the fiery temper of my friend
can then the son of greece the sage rejoin excite compassion in achilles mind seeks he the sorrow of our host to know
tell him not great machaon bleeds alone our bravest hero in the navy groan ulysses agamemnon diomed and stern_hector eurypylus already bleed
achilles heeds not but derides our pain even till the flame consume our fleet he stays and waits the rising of the fatal blaze
this is not half the story of our woe but ah what flattering hope i entertain chief after chief the raging foe destroys calm he looks on and every death enjoys
now the slow course of all impairing time unstrings my nerves and ends my manly prime oh had i still that strength my youth
possess when this bold arm the epeian power oppress the bulls of elis in glad triumph led and stretch the great itymonaeus dead
then from my fury fled the trembling swains and ours was all the plunder of the plain fifty white flocks full fifty herds of swine
as many goats as many lowing kine and thrice the number of unrivall steed all teeming females and of generous breeds
these as my first essay of arm i won old neleus gloried in his conquering son thus elis forced her long arrears restored and shares were parted to each pylian lord
the state of pyle was sunk to last despair when the proud elians first commenced the war for neleus son alcides rage had slain of twelve bold brother i alone remain
that large reprisal he might justly claim for prize defrauded and insulted fame when elis monarch at the public course detain his chariot and victorious horse
oppress we arm and now this conquest gain my sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain the rest the people shared myself survey d
three day were past when elis rose to war with many a courser and with many a car the son of actor at their army head young as they were the vengeful squadrons led
high on the rock fair thryoessa stands our utmost frontier on the pylian land not far the stream of famed alphaeus flow the stream they pass and pitch their tent below
the just partition and due victim paid pallas descending in the shade of night alarm the pylians and command the fight
each burns for fame and swells with martial pride myself the foremost but my sire denied fear for my youth exposed to stern_hector alarm and stopp my chariot and detain my arm
along fair arene delightful plain soft minyas rolls his water to the main there horse and foot the pylian troop unite and sheathed in arm expect the dawning light
my sire denied in vain on foot i fled amidst our chariot for the goddess led thence ere the sun advanced his noon day flame to great alphaeus sacred source we came
there first to which_jove our solemn rite were paid an untamed heifer pleased the blue eyed maid a bull alphaeus and a bull was slain to the blue monarch of the watery main
in arm we slept beside the winding flood while round the town the fierce epeians stood soon as the sun with all revealing ray flamed in the front of heaven and gave the day
the first who fell beneath my javelin bled king augias son and spouse of agamede she that all simples healing virtues knew and every herb that drinks the morning dew
bright scene of arm and work of war appear the nation meet there pylos elis here i seized his car the van of battle led the epeians saw they trembled and they fled
the foe dispersed their bravest warrior kill fierce as the whirlwind now i swept the field full fifty captive chariot graced my train
two chief from each fell breathless to the plain then actor son had died but neptune shrouds the youthful hero in a veil of cloud
o er heapy shield and er the prostrate throng collecting spoil and slaughtering all along through wide buprasian field we forced the foe where er the vales the olenian rock arose till pallas stopp us where alisium flows
even there the hindmost of the rear i slay and the same arm that led concludes the day then back to pyle triumphant take my way
there to high which_jove were public thanks assign as first of god to wise_nestor of mankind such then i was impell by youthful blood so proved my valour for my country good
how shall he grieve when to the eternal shade her host shall sink nor his the power to aid friend
my memory recalls the day when gathering aid along the grecian sea i and ulysses touch at phthia port and entered peleus hospitable court
achilles with unactive fury glows and gives to passion what to greece he owes a bull to which_jove he slew in sacrifice and pour libations on the flaming thighs
thyself achilles and thy reverend sire menoetius turn the fragments on the fire achilles sees us to the feast invites social we sit and share the genial rite
we then explained the cause on which we came urged you to arm and found you fierce for fame your ancient father generous precepts gave peleus said only this my son be brave
menoetius thus though great achilles shine in strength superior and of race divine yet cooler thought thy elder year attend let thy just counsel aid and rule thy friend
ah try the utmost that a friend can say such gentle force the fiercest mind obey some favouring god achilles heart may move though deaf to glory he may yield to love
thus spoke your father at thessalia court word now forgot though now of vast import if some dire oracle his breast alarm if aught from heaven withhold his saving arm
if thou but lead the myrmidonian line clad in achilles arm if thou appear proud troy may tremble and desist from war press by fresh force her er labour train
this touch his generous heart and from the tent along the shore with hasty strides he went soon as he came where on the crowded strand the public mart and courts of justice stand where the tall fleet of great ulysses lies and altars to the guardian god arise there sad he met the brave euaemon son large painful drops from all his members run an arrow head yet rooted in his wound
some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine shall seek their wall and greece respire again the sable blood in circle mark the ground
as faintly reeling he confess the smart weak was his pace but dauntless was his heart divine compassion touch patroclus breast
who sighing thus his bleeding friend address ah hapless leader of the grecian host thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast
is this your fate to glut the dog with gore far from your friend and from your native shore say great eurypylus
shall greece yet stand resists she yet the raging stern_hector hand or are her hero doom to die with shame and this the period of our war and fame
eurypylus replies no more my friend greece is no more this day her glory end even to the ship victorious troy pursues her force increasing as her toil renews
those chief that used her utmost rage to meet lie pierced with wound and bleeding in the fleet but thou patroclus act a friendly part lead to my ship and draw this deadly dart
with lukewarm water wash the gore away with healing balms the raging smart allay such as sage chiron sire of pharmacy
of two famed surgeons podalirius stands this hour surrounded by the trojan band and great machaon wounded in his tent now wants that succour which so oft he lent
once taught achilles and achilles thee to him the chief what then remains to do the event of things the god alone can view
charged by achilles great command i fly and bear with haste the pylian king reply but thy distress this instant claims relief
he said and in his arm upheld the chief the slaves their master slow approach survey and hides of oxen on the floor display
at length the wounded hero lay patroclus cut the forky steel away then in his hand a bitter root he bruised the wound he wash the styptic juice infused
there stretch the closing flesh that instant ceased to glow the wound to torture and the blood to flow illustration hercules
the greeks having retired into their intrenchments stern_hector attempts to force them but it proving impossible to pass the ditch polydamas advises to quit their chariot and manage the attack on foot
hercules book xii argument the battle at the grecian wall the trojans follow his counsel and having divided their army into five body of foot begin the assault
but upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons which appeared on the left hand of the trojans polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again
stern_hector also casting a stone of vast size force open one of the gate and enters at the head of his troop who victoriously pursue the grecians even to their ship
while thus the hero pious care attend the cure and safety of his wounded friend trojans and greeks with clashing shield engage and mutual death are dealt with mutual rage
nor long the trench or lofty wall oppose with god averse the ill fated work arose their power neglected and no victim slain the wall were raised the trenches sunk in vain
this stern_hector opposes and continues the attack in which after many actions sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall without the god how short a period stands the proudest monument of mortal hand
while sacred troy the warring host engaged but when her son were slain her city burn and what survived of greece to greece return then neptune and apollo shook the shore
then ida summits pour their watery store rhesus and rhodius then unite their rills caresus roaring down the stony hill ćsepus granicus with mingled force and xanthus foaming from his fruitful source and gulfy simois rolling to the main
these turn by phoebus from their wonted way deluged the rampire nine continual day the weight of water saps the yielding wall and to the sea the floating bulwarks fall
this stood while stern_hector and achilles raged helmet and shield and godlike hero slain incessant cataracts the thunderer pours and half the sky descend in sluicy showers
the god of ocean marching stern_hector before with his huge trident wound the trembling shore vast stone and piles from their foundation heaves and whelms the smoky ruin in the wave
now smooth with sand and levell by the flood no fragment tells where once the wonder stood in their old bounds the rivers roll again shine twixt the hill or wander er the plain
but this the god in later time perform as yet the bulwark stood and braved the storm the strokes yet echoed of contending power war thunder at the gate and blood distain d
the tower smote by the arm of which_jove with dire dismay close by their hollow ship the grecians lay stern_hector approach in every wind they hear and stern_hector fury every moment fear
so midst the dog and hunters daring band fierce of his might a boar or lion stands arm foe around a dreadful circle form and hissing javelin rain an iron storm
his power untamed their bold assault defy and where he turns the rout disperse or die he foams he glares he bounds against them all
he like a whirlwind toss the scattering throng mingled the troop and drove the field along and if he fall his courage makes him fall
the panting steed impatient fury breathe and snort and tremble at the gulf beneath just at the brink they neigh and paw the ground and the turf trembles and the sky resound
with equal rage encompass stern_hector glows exhorts his army and the trenches shows eager they view the prospect dark and deep vast was the leap and headlong hung the steep the bottom bare a formidable show
and bristled thick with sharpen stakes below the foot alone this strong defence could force and try the pass impervious to the horse
this saw polydamas who wisely brave restrain great stern_hector and this counsel gave thou bold leader of the trojan band
and you confederate chief from foreign land what entrance here can cumbrous chariot find the stakes beneath the grecian wall behind
no pass through those without a thousand wound no space for combat in yon narrow bounds proud of the favours mighty
which_jove has shown on certain danger we too rashly run if tis will our haughty foe to tame oh may this instant end the grecian name
here far from argos let their hero fall and one great day destroy and bury all but should they turn and here oppress our train what hope what methods of retreat remain
wedged in the trench by our own troop confused in one promiscuous carnage crush and bruised all troy must perish if their arm prevail nor shall a trojan live to tell the tale
hear then ye warrior and obey with speed back from the trenches let your steed be led then all alighting wedged in firm array proceed on foot and stern_hector lead the way
so greece shall stoop before our conquering power and this if which_jove consent her fatal hour illustration polydamas advising stern_hector polydamas advising stern_hector
this counsel pleased the godlike stern_hector sprung swift from his seat his clanging armour rung the chief example follow by his train
each quits his car and issues on the plain by order strict the charioteers enjoin compel the courser to their rank behind
the force part in five distinguish band and all obey their several chief command the best and bravest in the first conspire pant for the fight and threat the fleet with fire
great stern_hector glorious in the van of these polydamas and brave cebriones before the next the graceful paris shines and bold alcathous and agenor joins
the son of priam with the third appear deiphobus and helenas the seer in arm with these the mighty asius stood who drew from hyrtacus his noble blood and whom arisba yellow courser bore
the courser fed on selle winding shore antenor son the fourth battalion guide and great ćneas born on fountful ide
divine sarpedon the last band obey whom glaucus and asteropaeus aid next him the bravest at their army head but he more brave than all the host he led
now with compacted shield in close array the moving legions speed their headlong way already in their hope they fire the fleet and see the grecians gasping at their foot
while every trojan thus and every aid the advice of wise_nestor polydamas obey asius alone confiding in his car his vaunted courser urged to meet the war
and advised in vain those wheels returning ne er shall mark the plain no more those courser with triumphant joy restore their master to the gate of troy
fierce to the left he drives where from the plain the flying grecians strove their ship to gain swift through the wall their horse and chariot pass the gate half open to receive the last
thither exulting in his force he fly his following host with clamours rend the sky to plunge the grecians headlong in the main such their proud hope but all their hope were vain
unhappy hero black death attends behind the grecian wall and great idomeneus shall boast thy fall to guard the gate two mighty chief attend
as two tall oaks before the wall they rise their roots in earth their head amidst the sky whose spreading arm with leafy honour crown forbid the tempest and protect the ground high on the hill appears their stately form and their deep roots for ever brave the storm
who from the lapiths warlike race descend this polypoetes great perithous heir and that leonteus like the god of war so graceful these and so the shock they stand of raging asius and his furious band
in vain around them beat their hollow shield the fearless brother on the grecians call to guard their navy and defend the wall
orestes acamas in front appear and oenomaus and thoon close the rear in vain their clamours shake the ambient field even when they saw troy sable troop impend and greece tumultuous from her tower descend
so two wild boars spring furious from their den roused with the cry of dog and voice of man on every side the crackling trees they tear and root the shrubs and lay the forest bare
forth from the portals rush the intrepid pair opposed their breast and stood themselves the war they gnash their tusks with fire their eye balls roll till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul
around their head the whistling javelin sung with sounding strokes their brazen targets rung fierce was the fight while yet the grecian power maintain the wall and mann the lofty tower to save their fleet their last efforts they try and stone and dart in mingled tempests fly
as when sharp boreas blow abroad and brings the dreary winter on his frozen wing beneath the low hung cloud the sheets of snow descend and whiten all the field below so fast the dart on either army pour so down the rampires rolls the rocky shower heavy and thick resound the batter shield and the deaf echo rattles round the field
with shame repulsed with grief and fury driven the frantic asius thus accuses heaven in power immortal who shall now believe
can those too flatter and can which_jove deceive what man could doubt but troy victorious power should humble greece and this her fatal hour
but like when wasps from hollow crannies drive to guard the entrance of their common hive darkening the rock while with unwearied wing
they strike the assailants and infix their stings a race determined that to death contend so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend
these empty accents mingled with the wind nor moved great which_jove unalterable mind to godlike stern_hector and his matchless might was owed the glory of the destined fight
like deed of arm through all the forts were tried and all the gate sustain an equal tide through the long wall the stony showers were heard
god shall two warrior only guard their gate repel an army and defraud the fate the blaze of flame the flash of arm appear
while greece unconquer kept alive the war secure of death confiding in despair and all her guardian god in deep dismay with unassisting arm deplored the day
the spirit of a god my breast inspire to raise each act to life and sing with fire even yet the dauntless lapithae maintain the dreadful pass and round them heap the slain
first damasus by polypoetes steel pierced through his helmet brazen visor fell the weapon drank the mingled brains and gore the warrior sinks tremendous now no more
nor less leonteus strews the field with death first through the belt hippomachus he gored then sudden waved his unresisted sword antiphates as through the rank he broke the falchion struck and fate pursued the stroke iamenus orestes menon bled and round him rose a monument of dead
meantime the bravest of the trojan crew bold stern_hector and polydamas pursue fierce with impatience on the work to fall and wrap in rolling flame the fleet and wall
next ormenus and pylon yield their breath these on the farther bank now stood and gazed by heaven alarm by prodigies amazed
a signal omen stopp the passing host their martial fury in their wonder lost which_jove bird on sounding pinions beat the sky
a bleeding serpent of enormous size his talons truss alive and curling round he stung the bird whose throat received the wound mad with the smart he drops the fatal prey
in airy circle wing his painful way floats on the wind and rends the heaven with cry amidst the host the fallen serpent lies
then first polydamas the silence broke long weigh the signal and to stern_hector spoke how oft my brother thy reproach i bear for word well meant and sentiments sincere
they pale with terror mark its spires unroll and which_jove portent with beating heart behold true to those counsel which i judge the best i tell the faithful dictates of my breast
in peace in war in council and in fight and all i move deferring to thy sway but tends to raise that power which i obey
seek not this day the grecian ship to gain for sure to warn us which_jove his omen sent and thus my mind explains its clear event
the victor eagle whose sinister flight retards our host and fills our heart with fright dismiss his conquest in the middle sky allow to seize but not possess the prize
thus though we gird with fire the grecian fleet though these proud bulwalks tumble at our foot toil unforeseen and fiercer are decreed more woe shall follow and more hero bleed
to speak his thought is every freeman right then hear my word nor may my word be vain so bodes my soul and bids me thus advise for thus a skilful seer would read the sky
to him then stern_hector with disdain return fierce as he spoke his eye with fury burn are these the faithful counsel of thy tongue
thy will is partial not thy reason wrong or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent
what coward counsel would thy madness move against the word the will reveal of which_jove the leading sign the irrevocable nod and happy thunder of the favouring god
these shall i slight and guide my wavering mind by wandering birds that flit with every wind ye vagrants of the sky
your wing extend or where the sun arise or where descend to right to left unheeded take your way while i the dictates of high heaven obey
without a sign his sword the brave man draws and asks no omen but his country cause but why should st thou suspect the war success
none fear it more as none promotes it less though all our chief amidst yon ship expire trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire
yet should the fear that wary mind suggests spread their cold poison through our soldiers breast my javelin can revenge so base a part and free the soul that quivers in thy heart
furious he spoke and rushing to the wall calls on his host his host obey the call with ardour follow where their leader fly redoubling clamours thunder in the sky
which_jove breathes a whirlwind from the hill of ide and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide he fills the greeks with terror and dismay and gives great stern_hector the predestined day
troy and her son may find a general grave but thou canst live for thou canst be a slave strong in themselves but stronger in his aid close to the work their rigid siege they laid
in vain the mounds and massy beams defend while these they undermine and those they rend upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall and heap on heap the smoky ruin fall
greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarm the crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arm shield touching shield a long refulgent row whence hissing dart incessant rain below
the bold ajaces fly from tower to tower and rouse with flame divine the grecian power the generous impulse every greek obeys threats urge the fearful and the valiant praise
fellows in arm whose deed are known to fame and you whose ardour hope an equal name since not alike endued with force or art
behold a day when each may act his part a day to fire the brave and warm the cold to gain new glory or augment the old
urge those who stand and those who faint excite drown stern_hector vaunts in loud exhorts of fight conquest not safety fill the thought of all
seek not your fleet but sally from the wall so which_jove once more may drive their routed train and troy lie trembling in her wall again
their ardour kindles all the grecian power and now the stone descend in heavier showers as when high which_jove his sharp artillery form and opes his cloudy magazine of storm
in winter bleak un comfortable reign a snowy inundation hides the plain he stills the wind and bids the sky to sleep then pours the silent tempest thick and deep and first the mountain tops are cover o er then the green field and then the sandy shore
bent with the weight the nodding wood are seen and one bright waste hides all the work of man the circling sea alone absorbing all drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall
so from each side increased the stony rain and the white ruin rises er the plain thus godlike stern_hector and his troop contend to force the ramparts and the gate to rend
nor troy could conquer nor the greeks would yield till great sarpedon tower amid the field for mighty which_jove inspired with martial flame his matchless son and urged him on to fame
in arm he shines conspicuous from afar and bears aloft his ample shield in air within whose orb the thick bull hides were roll ponderous with brass and bound with ductile gold and while two pointed javelin arm his hand majestic moves along and leads his lycian band
so press with hunger from the mountain brow descends a lion on the flocks below so stalks the lordly savage er the plain
in sullen majesty and stern_hector disdain in vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar and shepherds gall him with an iron war regardless furious he pursues his way he foams he roars he rends the panting prey
he view the tower and meditates their fall to sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall then casting on his friend an ardent look fired with the thirst of glory thus he spoke why boast we glaucus
where xanthus stream enrich the lycian plain our numerous herds that range the fruitful field and hill where vines their purple harvest yield our foaming bowls with
resolved alike divine sarpedon glows with generous rage that drives him on the foe our extended reign purer nectar crown our feasts enhanced with music sprightly sound
why on those shore are we with joy survey admired as hero and as god obey unless great acts superior merit prove and vindicate the bounteous power above
tis ours the dignity they give to grace the first in valour as the first in place that when with wondering eye our martial band behold our deed transcending our command such they may cry deserve the sovereign state whom those that envy dare not imitate
could all our care elude the gloomy grave which claims no less the fearful and the brave for lust of fame i should not vainly dare in fighting field nor urge thy soul to war
the life which other pay let us bestow and give to fame what we to nature owe brave though we fall and
but since alas ignoble age must come disease and death inexorable doom honour if we live or let us glory gain or glory give
he said his word the listening chief inspire with equal warmth and rouse the warrior fire the troop pursue their leader with delight rush to the foe and claim the promised fight
menestheus from on high the storm beheld threatening the fort and blackening in the field around the wall he gazed to view from far what aid appear to avert the approaching war and saw where teucer with the ajaces stood of fight insatiate prodigal of blood
in vain he calls the din of helms and shield rings to the sky and echoes through the field the brazen hinges fly the wall resound heaven trembles roar the mountain thunder all the ground then thus to thoos hence with speed he said and urge the bold ajaces to our aid their strength united best may help to bear the bloody labour of the doubtful war hither the lycian prince bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force
but if too fiercely there the foe contend let ajax_telamon at least our tower defend and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe
swift at the word the herald speeds along the lofty ramparts through the martial throng and finds the hero bathed in sweat and gore opposed in combat on the dusty shore
your aid said thoos peteus son demands your strength united best may help to bear the bloody labour of the doubtful war thither the lycian prince bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force
ye valiant leader of our warlike band but if too fiercely here the foe contend at least let ajax_telamon those tower defend
and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe straight to the fort great
oilean_ajax turn his care and thus bespoke his brother of the war now valiant lycomede exert your might and brave oileus prove your force in fight to you i trust the fortune of the field
till by this arm the foe shall be repell that done expect me to complete the day then with his sevenfold shield he strode away
high on the wall appear the lycian power like some black tempest gathering round the tower the greeks oppress their utmost force unite prepared to labour in the unequal fight the war renews mix shouts and groans arise tumultuous clamour mounts and thickens in the sky
with equal steps bold teucer press the shore whose fatal bow the strong pandion bore fierce oilean_ajax first the advancing host invades and sends the brave epicles to the shade sarpedon friend
across the warrior way rent from the wall a rocky fragment lay in modern age not the strongest swain could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain he poised and swung it round then toss on high it flew with force and labour up the sky
as skilful divers from some airy steep headlong descend and shoot into the deep so fall epicles then in groans expires and murmuring to the shade the soul retires
while to the ramparts daring glaucus drew from teucer hand a winged arrow flew the bearded shaft the destined passage found and on his naked arm inflicts a wound
the chief who fear some foe insulting boast might stop the progress of his warlike host conceal the wound and leaping from his height retired reluctant from the unfinish fight
full on the lycian helmet thundering down the ponderous ruin crush his batter crown divine sarpedon with regret beheld disabled glaucus slowly quit the field
alcmaon first was doom his force to feel deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel then from the yawning wound with fury tore the spear pursued by gushing stream of gore
his beating breast with generous ardour glows he spring to fight and fly upon the foe down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound his brazen armour rings against the ground
swift to the battlement the victor fly tugs with full force and every nerve applies it shakes the ponderous stone disjointed yield the rolling ruin smoke along the field
a mighty breach appears the wall lie bare and like a deluge rushes in the war at once bold teucer draws the twanging bow and oilean_ajax sends his javelin at the foe fix in his belt
the feather weapon stood and through his buckler drove the trembling wood but which_jove was present in the dire debate to shield his offspring and avert his fate
the prince gave back not meditating flight but urging vengeance and severer fight then raised with hope and fired with glory charm his fainting squadrons to new fury warms
the breach lies open but your chief in vain attempts alone the guarded pass to gain unite and soon that hostile fleet shall fall the force of powerful union conquers all
where ye lycians is the strength you boast your former fame and ancient virtue lost this just rebuke inflamed the lycian crew they join they thicken and the assault renew
unmoved the embodied greeks their fury dare and fix support the weight of all the war nor could the greeks repel the lycian power
as on the confines of adjoining ground two stubborn swains with blow dispute their bounds they tug they sweat but neither gain nor yield one foot one inch of the contended field thus obstinate to death they fight they fall nor these can keep nor those can win the wall
their manly breast are pierced with many a wound loud strokes are heard and rattling arm resound the copious slaughter covers all the shore and the high ramparts drip with human gore
as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads from side to side the trembling balance nods while some laborious matron just and poor with nice exactness weighs her woolly store
nor the bold lycians force the grecian tower till poised aloft the resting beam suspends each equal weight nor this nor that descends
so stood the war till stern_hector matchless might with fate prevailing turn the scale of fight fierce as a whirlwind up the wall he fly and fire his host with loud repeated cry
they hear they run and gathering at his call raise scaling engines and ascend the wall around the work a wood of glittering spear shoots up and all the rising host appears
a ponderous stone bold stern_hector heaved to throw pointed above and rough and gross below not two strong man the enormous weight could raise such man as live in these degenerate day yet this as easy as a swain could bear the snowy fleece he toss and shook in air for which_jove upheld and lighten of its load the unwieldy rock the labour of a god
thus arm before the folded gate he came of massy substance and stupendous frame with iron bars and brazen hinges strong on lofty beams of solid timber hung
then thundering through the planks with forceful sway drives the sharp rock the solid beams give way the folds are shatter from the crackling door leap the resounding bars the flying hinges roar
advance ye trojans lend your valiant hand haste to the fleet and toss the blazing brands now rushing in the furious chief appears gloomy as night
and shakes two shining spear a dreadful gleam from his bright armour came and from his eye balls flash the living flame
then pouring after through the gaping space a tide of trojans flows and fills the place the greeks behold they tremble and they fly the shore is heap with death and tumult rends the sky
he moves a god resistless in his course and seems a match for more than mortal force illustration greek altar greek altar
neptune concerned for the loss of the grecians upon seeing the fortification forced by stern_hector who had entered the gate near the station of the ajaces assumes the shape of calchas and inspires those hero to oppose him then in the form of one of the generals encourages the other greeks who had retired to their vessel
book xiii argument the fourth battle continued in which neptune assists the greeks the acts of idomeneus the ajaces form their troop in a close phalanx and put a stop to stern_hector and the trojans
several deed of valour are performed meriones losing his spear in the encounter repairs to seek another at the tent of idomeneus this occasions a conversation between those two warrior who return together to the battle
idomeneus signalizes his courage above the rest he kills othryoneus asius and alcathous deiphobus and ćneas march against him and at length idomeneus retires
the trojans are repulsed on the left wing stern_hector still keeps his ground against the ajaces till being galled by the locrian slingers and archers polydamas advises to call a council of war stern_hector approves of his advice but goes first to rally the trojans upbraids paris rejoins polydamas meets oilean_ajax again and renews the attack
great_menelaus wound helenus and kills pisander the eight and twentieth day still continues the scene is between the grecian wall and the sea shore
when now the thunderer on the sea beat coast had fix great stern_hector and his conquering host he left them to the fate in bloody fray to toil and struggle through the well fought day
to where the mysians prove their martial force and hardy thracians tame the savage horse and where the far famed hippomolgian strays renown for justice and for length of day
that innocent of blood from milk innoxious seek their simple food which_jove sees delighted and avoids the scene of guilty troy of arm and dying man
then turn to thracia from the field of fight those eye that shed insufferable light thrice happy race no aid he deems to either host is given while his high law suspends the power of heaven
in samothracia on a mountain brow whose waving wood erhung the deeps below he sat and round him cast his azure eye where ida misty tops confusedly rise below fair ilion glittering spires were seen the crowded ship and sable sea between
meantime the monarch of the watery main observed the thunderer nor observed in vain there from the crystal chambers of the main emerged he sat and mourn his argives slain
fierce as he pass the lofty mountain nod the forest shakes earth trembled as he trod and felt the footsteps of the immortal god
at which_jove incensed with grief and fury stung prone down the rocky steep he rush along from realm to realm three ample strides he took
far in the bay his shining palace stands eternal frame not raised by mortal hand this having reach his brass hoof steed he rein fleet as the wind and deck with golden manes
he mounts the car the golden scourge applies he sits superior and the chariot fly his whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep the enormous monsters rolling er the deep gambol around him on the watery way and heavy whales in awkward measures play the sea subsiding spreads a level plain exults and owns the monarch of the main the parting wave before his courser fly the wondering water leave his axle dry
deep in the liquid regions lies a cave between where tenedos the surges lave and rocky imbrus breaks the rolling wave there the great ruler of the azure round stopp his swift chariot and his steed unbound fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand
and at the fourth the distant ćgae shook refulgent arm his mighty limb infold immortal arm of adamant and gold and link their fetlocks with a golden band infrangible immortal there they stay
the father of the flood pursues his way where like a tempest darkening heaven around or fiery deluge that devours the ground the impatient trojans in a gloomy throng embattled roll as stern_hector rush along to the loud tumult and the barbarous cry the heaven re echo and the shore reply they vow destruction to the grecian name and in their hope the fleet already flame
but neptune rising from the sea profound the god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground now wears a mortal form like calchas seen such his loud voice and such his manly mien his shouts incessant every greek inspire but
most the ajaces adding fire to fire illustration neptune rising from the sea neptune rising from the sea tis yours warrior all our hope to raise oh recollect your ancient worth and praise
tis yours to save us if you cease to fear flight more than shameful is destructive here on other work though troy with fury fall
and pour her army er our batter wall there greece has strength but this this part erthrown her strength were vain i dread for you alone
here stern_hector rage like the force of fire vaunts of his god and calls high which_jove his sire if yet some heavenly power your breast excite breathe in your heart and string your arm to fight greece yet may live her threaten fleet maintain
then with his sceptre that the deep controls he touch the chief and steel their manly soul strength not their own the touch divine imparts prompts their light limb and swells their daring heart
then as a falcon from the rocky height her quarry seen impetuous at the sight forth springing instant dart herself from high shoots on the wing and skims along the sky
and stern_hector force and which_jove own aid be vain such and so swift the power of ocean flew the wide horizon shut him from their view
the inspiring god oileus active son perceived the first and thus to ajax_telamon some god my friend some god in human form favouring descends and wills to stand the storm
not calchas this the venerable seer short as he turned i saw the power appear i mark his parting and the steps he trod his own bright evidence reveals a god
even now some energy divine i share and seem to walk on wing and tread in air with equal ardour ajax_telamon return
my soul is kindled and my bosom burns new rising spirit all my force alarm lift each impatient limb and brace my arm
this ready arm unthinking shakes the dart the blood pours back and fortifies my heart singly methinks yon towering chief i meet and stretch the dreadful stern_hector at my foot
full of the god that urged their burning breast the hero thus their mutual warmth express neptune meanwhile the routed greeks inspired
who breathless pale with length of labour tired pant in the ship while troy to conquest calls and swarms victorious er their yielding wall
trembling before the impending storm they lie while tear of rage stand burning in their eye greece sunk they thought and this their fatal hour but breathe new courage as they feel the power
then stern_hector peneleus rises to the fight thoas deipyrus in arm renown and merion next the impulsive fury found last wise_nestor son the same bold ardour takes
teucer and leitus first his word excite while thus the god the martial fire awakes oh lasting infamy oh dire disgrace to chief of vigorous youth and manly race
i trusted in the god and you to see brave greece victorious and her navy free ah no the glorious combat you disclaim and one black day cloud all her former fame
heaven what a prodigy these eye survey unseen unthought till this amazing day fly we at length from troy oft conquer band
and fall our fleet by such inglorious hand a rout undisciplined a straggling train not born to glory of the dusty plain
like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued a prey to every savage of the wood shall these so late who trembled at your name invade your camp involve your ship in flame
a change so shameful say what cause has wrought the soldiers baseness or the general fault fools will ye perish for your leader vice the purchase infamy and life the price
tis not your cause achilles injured fame another is the crime but yours the shame grant that our chief offend through rage or lust must you be cowards if your king unjust
prevent this evil and your country save small thought retrieves the spirit of the brave think and subdue on dastards dead to fame i waste no anger for they feel no shame
but you the pride the flower of all our host my heart weeps blood to see your glory lost nor deem this day this battle all you lose a day more black a fate more vile ensues
let each reflect who prize fame or breath on endless infamy on instant death for lo the fated time the appointed shore hark
the gate burst the brazen barriers roar impetuous stern_hector thunder at the wall the hour the spot to conquer or to fall
these word the grecians fainting heart inspire and listening army catch the godlike fire fix at his post was each bold
so close their order so disposed their fight as pallas self might view with fix delight or had the god of war inclined his eye the god of war had own a just surprise
oilean_ajax found with well ranged squadrons strongly circled round a chosen phalanx firm resolved as fate descending stern_hector and his battle wait
an iron scene gleams dreadful er the field armour in armour lock and shield in shield spear lean on spear on targets targets throng helms stuck to helms and man drove man along
as when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove and levell at the sky with pointing rays their brandish lance at each motion blaze
thus breathing death in terrible array the close compacted legions urged their way fierce they drove on impatient to destroy troy charged the first and stern_hector first of troy
as from some mountain craggy forehead torn a rock round fragment fly with fury borne which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends precipitate the ponderous mass descends
from steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds at every shock the crackling wood resounds still gathering force it smokes and urged amain whirls leaps and thunder down impetuous to the plain there stops so stern_hector
on him the war is bent the dart are shed and all their falchions wave around his head repulsed he stands nor from his stand retires but with repeated shouts his army fire
the floating plumes unnumber wave above their whole force he proved resistless when he raged and when he stopp unmoved
trojans be firm this arm shall make your way through yon square body and that black array stand and my spear shall rout their scattering power
strong as they seem embattled like a tower for he that juno heavenly bosom warms the first of god this day inspires our arm
he said and roused the soul in every breast urged with desire of fame beyond the rest forth march deiphobus but marching held before his wary steps his ample shield
the glittering javelin pierced the tough bull hide but pierced not through unfaithful to his hand the point broke short and sparkled in the sand
bold merion aim a stroke nor aim it wide the trojan warrior touch with timely fear on the raised orb to distance bore the spear
the greek retreating mourn his frustrate blow and cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe then to the ship with surly speed he went to seek a surer javelin in his tent
meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows the tumult thickens and the clamour grows by teucer arm the warlike imbrius bleeds the son of mentor rich in generous steed
ere yet to troy the son of greece were led in fair pedaeus verdant pastures bred the youth had dwelt remote from war alarm and blest in bright medesicaste arm
this nymph the fruit of priam ravish joy allied the warrior to the house of troy to troy when glory call his arm he came and match the bravest of her chief in fame
with priam son a guardian of the throne he lived beloved and honour as his own him teucer pierced between the throat and ear he groans beneath the telamonian spear
as from some far seen mountain airy crown subdued by steel a tall ash tumbles down and soils its verdant tresses on the ground so fall the youth his arm the fall resound
then teucer rushing to despoil the dead from stern_hector hand a shining javelin fled he saw and shunn the death the forceful dart sung on and pierced amphimachus heart cteatus son of neptune forceful line vain was his courage and his race divine
to seize his beamy helm the victor fly and just had fastened on the dazzling prize when oilean_ajax manly arm a javelin flung full on the shield round boss the weapon rung he felt the shock nor more was doom to feel secure in mail and sheath in shining steel
prostrate he fall his clanging arm resound and his broad buckler thunder on the ground repulsed he yields the victor greeks obtain the spoil contested and bear off the slain
between the leader of the athenian line stichius the brave menestheus the divine deplored amphimachus sad object lies imbrius remains the fierce ajaces prize
in their fell jaws high lifting through the wood and sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood so these the chief great oilean_ajax from the dead strips his bright arm oileus lops his head toss like a ball and whirl in air away at stern_hector foot the gory visage lay
the god of ocean fired with stern_hector disdain and pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain inspires the grecian heart confirms their hand and breathes destruction on the trojan band
swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet he finds the lance famed idomen of crete his pensive brow the generous care
with which a wounded soldier touch his breast whom in the chance of war a javelin tore and his sad comrades from the battle bore him to the surgeons of the camp he sent that office paid he issued from his tent fierce for the fight to whom the god begun in thoas voice
as two grim lion bear across the lawn snatch from devouring hounds a slaughter fawn express andraemon valiant son who ruled where calydon white rock arise and pleuron chalky cliffs emblaze the sky
where now the imperious vaunt the daring boast of greece victorious and proud ilion lost to whom the king on greece no blame be thrown arm are her trade and war is all her own
her hardy hero from the well fought plain nor fear withholds nor shameful sloth detains tis heaven alas and which_jove all powerful doom that far far distant from our native home
once foremost in the fight still prone to lend or arm or counsel now perform thy best and what thou canst not singly urge the rest
wills us to fall inglorious oh my friend thus he and thus the god whose force can make the solid globe eternal basis shake
ah never may he see his native land but feed the vultures on this hateful strand who seeks ignobly in his ship to stay nor dares to combat on this signal day
together let us battle on the plain two not the worst nor even this succour vain not vain the weakest if their force unite
for this behold in horrid arm i shine and urge thy soul to rival acts with mine but ours the bravest have confess in fight
this said he rushes where the combat burns swift to his tent the cretan king return from thence two javelin glittering in his hand and clad in arm that lighten all the strand fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove like lightning bursting from the arm of which_jove which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares or terrifies the offending world with war in streamy sparkles kindling all the sky from pole to pole the trail of glory fly
thus his bright armour er the dazzled throng gleam dreadful as the monarch flash along him near his tent meriones attends
whom thus he questions ever best of friend say in every art of battle skill what holds thy courage from so brave a field
on some important message art thou bound or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound inglorious here my soul abhors to stay and glows with prospects of th approaching day
meriones replies whose care leads forth the embattled son of crete to war this speaks my grief this headless lance i wield the rest lies rooted in a trojan shield
to whom the cretan enter and receive the wonted weapon those my tent can give spear i have store and trojan lance all
prince that shed a lustre round the illumined wall though i disdainful of the distant war nor trust the dart nor aim the uncertain spear
yet hand to hand i fight and spoil the slain and thence these trophies and these arm i gain enter and see on heap the helmet roll
and high hung spear and shield that flame with gold nor vain said merion are our martial toil we too can boast of no ignoble spoil
but those my ship contains whence distant far i fight conspicuous in the van of war what need i more if any greek there be
who knows not merion i appeal to thee to this idomeneus the field of fight have proved thy valour and unconquer might
and were some ambush for the foe design even there thy courage would not lag behind in that sharp service singled from the rest the fear of each or valour stands confess
he shifts his place his colour comes and goes a dropping sweat creeps cold on every part against his bosom beats his quivering heart terror and death in his wild eye balls stare with chattering teeth he stands and stiffening hair and looks a bloodless image of despair
no force no firmness the pale coward shows not so the brave still dauntless still the same unchanged his colour and unmoved his frame
composed his thought determined is his eye and fix his soul to conquer or to die if aught disturb the tenour of his breast tis but the wish to strike before the rest
by chance of fight whatever wound you bore those wound were glorious all and all before such as may teach twas still thy brave delight
in such assays thy blameless worth is known and every art of dangerous war thy ownt oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight
but why like infant cold to honour charm stand we to talk when glory calls to arm go from my conquer spear the choicest take
and to their owners send them nobly back swift at the word bold merion snatch a spear and breathing slaughter follow to the war
so mars armipotent invades the plain the wide destroyer of the race of man terror his best beloved son attends his course arm with stern_hector boldness and enormous force the pride of haughty warrior to confound and lay the strength of tyrants on the ground from thrace they fly call to the dire alarm of warring phlegyans and ephyrian arm invoked by both relentless they dispose to these glad conquest murderous rout to those
so march the leader of the cretan train and their bright arm shot horror er the plain then first spake merion
shall we join the right or combat in the centre of the fight or to the left our wonted succour lend
our ablest chieftains the main battle guide each godlike oilean_ajax makes that post his care and gallant teucer deals destruction there skill or with shafts to gall the distant field or bear close battle on the sounding shield
hazard and fame all part alike attend not in the centre idomen replied these can the rage of haughty stern_hector tame safe in their arm the navy fear no flame
till which_jove himself descends his bolts to shed and hurl the blazing ruin at our head great must he be of more than human birth nor feed like mortal on the fruits of earth
him neither rock can crush nor steel can wound whom oilean_ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground in standing fight he mates achilles force excell alone in swiftness in the course
then to the left our ready arm apply and live with glory or with glory die he said and merion to th appointed place fierce as the god of battle urged his pace
soon as the foe the shining chief beheld rush like a fiery torrent er the field their force embodied in a tide they pour the rising combat sound along the shore
as warring wind in sirius sultry reign from different quarters sweep the sandy plain on every side the dusty whirlwinds rise and the dry field are lifted to the sky
thus by despair hope rage together driven met the black host and meeting darken heaven all dreadful glared the iron face of war bristled with upright spear that
flash afar dire was the gleam of breastplates helms and shield and polish arm emblazed the flaming field tremendous scene that general horror gave but touch with joy
the bosom of the brave saturn great son in fierce contention vied and crowds of hero in their anger died the sire of earth and heaven by thetis won to crown with glory
while neptune rising from his azure main warr on the king of heaven with stern_hector disdain and breathed revenge and fired the grecian train
god of one source of one ethereal race alike divine and heaven their native place but which_jove the greater first born of the sky and more than man or god supremely wise_nestor
peleus godlike son will not destruction to the grecian power but spared awhile the destined trojan tower for this of which_jove superior might afraid neptune in human form conceal his aid
these power enfold the greek and trojan train in war and discord adamantine chain indissolubly strong the fatal tie is stretch on both and close compell they die
first by his hand othryoneus was slain swell with false hope with mad ambition vain call by the voice of war to martial fame from high cabesus distant wall he came cassandra love he sought with boasts of power and promised conquest was the proffer dower
dreadful in arm and grown in combat grey the bold idomeneus controls the day the king consented by his vaunts abused the king consented but the fate refused
proud of himself and of the imagined bride the field he measured with a larger stride him as he stalk the cretan javelin found vain was his breastplate to repel the wound
his dream of glory lost he plunged to hell his arm resounded as the boaster fell the great idomeneus bestrides the dead and thus he cry behold thy promise sped
such is the help thy arm to ilion bring and such the contract of the phrygian king our offers now illustrious prince receive for such an aid what will not argos give
meantime on further methods to advise come follow to the fleet thy new allies there hear what greece has on her part to say
to conquer troy with ours thy force join and count atrides fairest daughter thine he spoke and dragg the gory corse away
this asius view unable to contain before his chariot warring on the plain his crowded courser to his squire consign impatient panted on his neck behind
to vengeance rising with a sudden spring he hoped the conquest of the cretan king the wary cretan as his foe drew near full on his throat discharged the forceful spear
as when the mountain oak or poplar tall or pine fit mast for some great admiral groans to the oft heaved axe with many a wound then spreads a length of ruin er the ground so sunk proud asius in that dreadful day and stretch before his much loved courser lay
beneath the chin the point was seen to glide and glitter extant at the further side he grinds the dust distain with streaming gore and fierce in death lies foaming on the shore
deprived of motion stiff with stupid fear stands all aghast his trembling charioteer nor shuns the foe nor turns the steed away but fall
transfix an unresisting prey pierced by antilochus he pants beneath the stately car and labour out his breath thus asius steed their mighty master gone
remain the prize of wise_nestor youthful son stabb at the sight deiphobus drew nigh and made with force the vengeful weapon fly
beneath the spacious targe a blazing round thick with bull hides and brazen orbits bound on his raised arm by two strong braces stay
the cretan saw and stooping caused to glance from his slope shield the disappointed lance he lay collected in defensive shade
even then the spear the vigorous arm confess and pierced obliquely king hypsenor breast warm in his liver to the ground it bore the chief his people guardian now no more
o er his safe head the javelin idly sung and on the tinkling verge more faintly rung not unattended the proud trojan cry
nor unrevenged lamented asius lies for thee through hell black portals stand display this mate shall joy thy melancholy shade
heart piercing anguish at the haughty boast touch every greek but wise_nestor son the most grieved as he was his pious arm attend and his broad buckler shield his slaughter friend
nor yet from fight idomeneus withdraws resolved to perish in his country cause or find some foe whom heaven and he shall doom to wail his fate in death eternal gloom
he sees alcathous in the front aspire great ćsyetes was the hero sire his spouse hippodame divinely fair anchises eldest hope and darling care who charm her parent and her husband heart with beauty sense and every work of art he once of ilion youth the loveliest boy the fairest she of all the fair of troy
who covers with a cloud those beauteous eye and fetters every limb yet bent to meet his fate he stands nor shuns the lance of crete
till sad mecistheus and alastor bore his honour body to the tented shore by neptune now the hapless hero dies fix as some column or deep rooted oak
while the wind sleep his breast received the stroke before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields long used to ward the death in fighting field
the riven armour sends a jarring sound his labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound the long lance shakes and vibrates in the wound fast flowing from its source as prone he lay life purple tide impetuous gush away
then idomen insulting er the slain behold deiphobus nor vaunt in vain see on one greek three trojan ghosts attend
this my third victim to the shade i send approaching now thy boasted might approve and try the prowess of the seed of which_jove
enamour of a mortal dame great minos guardian of his country came deucalion blameless prince was minos heir his first born i the third from jupiter er spacious crete and her bold son i reign and thence my ship transport me through the main lord of a host er all my host i shine a scourge to thee thy father and thy line
the trojan heard uncertain or to meet alone with venturous arm the king of crete or seek auxiliar force at length decreed to call some hero to partake the deed forthwith ćneas rises to his thought
for him in troy remotest line he sought where he incensed at partial priam stands and sees superior posts in meaner hand
to him ambitious of so great an aid the bold deiphobus approach and said now trojan prince employ thy pious arm if er thy bosom felt fair honour charm
from which_jove alcathous dies thy brother and thy friend come and the warrior loved remains defend beneath his care thy early youth was train one table fed you and one roof contain
ćneas heard and for a space resign to tender pity all his manly mind then rising in his rage he burns to fight
this deed to fierce idomeneus we owe haste and revenge it on th insulting foe the greek awaits him with collected might
as the fell boar on some rough mountain head arm with wild terror and to slaughter bred when the loud rustics rise and shout from far attends the tumult and expects the war er his bent back the bristly horror rise fire stream in lightning from his sanguine eye
his foaming tusks both dog and man engage but most his hunters rouse his mighty rage so stood idomeneus his javelin shook and met the trojan with a lowering look
the youthful offspring of the god of war merion and aphareus in field renown to these the warrior sent his voice around
antilochus deipyrus were near fellows in arm your timely aid unite lo great ćneas rushes to the fight sprung from a god and more than mortal bold
he fresh in youth and i in arm grown old else should this hand this hour decide the strife the great dispute of glory or of life
ćneas too demands th assisting force of his native band paris deiphobus agenor join co aid and captains of the trojan line
in order follow all th embodied train like ida flocks proceeding er the plain before his fleecy care erect and bold stalks the proud ram the father of the bold
he spoke and all as with one soul obey their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade around the chief with joy the swain surveys them as he leads to the cool fountains through the well known meads
round dread alcathous now the battle rose on every side the steely circle grows now batter breast plates and hack helmet ring
so joy ćneas as his native band moves on in rank and stretches er the land and er their head unheeded javelin sing
above the rest two towering chief appear there great idomeneus ćneas here like god of war dispensing fate they stood and burn to drench the ground with mutual blood
whizz along in air the cretan saw and shunn the brazen spear sent from an arm so strong the missive wood
the forceful spear his hollow corslet broke it ripp his belly with a ghastly wound and roll the smoking entrails on the ground
the trojan weapon stuck deep in earth and quiver where it stood but oenomas received the cretan stroke stretch on the plain he sobs away his breath
and furious grasps the bloody dust in death the victor from his breast the weapon tear his spoil he could not for the shower of spear
though now unfit an active war to wage heavy with cumbrous arm stiff with cold age his listless limb unable for the course in standing fight he yet maintains his force till faint with labour and by foe repell
deiphobus beheld him as he pass and fired with hate a parting javelin cast the javelin err but held its course along and pierced ascalaphus the brave and young
his tired slow steps he drags from off the field the son of mars fell gasping on the ground and gnash the dust all bloody with his wound
nor knew the furious father of his fall high throned amidst the great olympian hall on golden cloud th immortal synod sate detain from bloody war by which_jove and fate
for slain ascalaphus commenced the fray deiphobus to seize his helmet fly and from his temples rends the glittering prize valiant as mars meriones drew near
and on his loaded arm discharged his spear he drops the weight disabled with the pain the hollow helmet rings against the plain
swift as a vulture leaping on his prey from his torn arm the grecian rent away the reeking javelin and rejoin his friend
good polites tends around his waist his pious arm he threw and from the rage of battle gently drew him his swift courser on his splendid car rapt from the lessening thunder of the war to troy they drove him groaning from the shore and sprinkling as he pass the sands with gore
now where in dust the breathless hero lay his wounded brother meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground heap fall on heap and heaven and earth resound
bold aphareus by great ćneas bled as toward the chief he turn his daring head he pierced his throat the bending head depress beneath his helmet nods upon his breast his shield reversed er the fallen warrior lies and everlasting slumber seals his eye
antilochus as thoon turn him round transpierced his back with a dishonest wound the hollow vein that to the neck extends along the chine his eager javelin rends
th exulting victor leaping where he lay from his broad shoulder tore the spoil away his time observed for closed by foe around on all side thick the peals of arm resound
supine he fall and to his social train spreads his imploring arm but spreads in vain his shield emboss the ringing storm sustains but he impervious and untouch remains
in arm intrepid with the first he fought faced every foe and every danger sought his winged lance resistless as the wind obeys each motion of the master mind
great neptune care preserved from hostile rage this youth the joy of wise_nestor glorious age restless it fly impatient to be free and meditates the distant enemy
the son of asius adamas drew near and struck his target with the brazen spear fierce in his front but neptune wards the blow and blunts the javelin of th eluded foe
in the broad buckler half the weapon stood splinter on earth flew half the broken wood disarm he mingled in the trojan crew but merion spear ertook him as he flew
deep in the belly rim an entrance found where sharp the pang and mortal is the wound bending he fell and doubled to the ground lay panting
thus an ox in fetters tied while death strong pangs distend his labouring side his bulk enormous on the field displays his heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays
next brave deipyrus in dust was laid king helenus waved high the thracian blade and smote his temples with an arm so strong the helm fell off and roll amid the throng
the spear the conqueror from his body drew and death dim shadows swarm before his view there for some luckier greek it rests a prize for dark in death the godlike owner lies
raging with grief great_menelaus burns and fraught with vengeance to the victor turns that shook the ponderous lance in act to throw and this stood adverse with the bended bow
full on his breast the trojan arrow fell but harmless bounded from the plated steel as on some ample barn well harden floor the wind collected at each open door
while the broad fan with force is whirl around light leaps the golden grain resulting from the ground so from the steel that guards atrides heart repell to distance fly the bounding dart
atrides watchful of the unwary foe pierced with his lance the hand that grasp the bow and nailed it to the yew
the wounded hand trail the long lance that mark with blood the sand but good agenor gently from the wound the spear solicits and the bandage bound a sling soft wool
snatch from a soldier side at once the tent and ligature supplied behold pisander urged by fate decree spring through the rank to fall and fall by thee great_menelaus
to enchance thy fame high towering in the front the warrior came first the sharp lance was by atrides thrown the lance far distant by the wind was blown
not so discouraged to the future blind vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind dauntless he rushes where the spartan lord like lightning brandish his far beaming sword
nor pierced pisander through atrides shield pisander spear fell shiver on the field his left arm high opposed the shining shield
his right beneath the cover pole axe held an olive cloudy grain the handle made distinct with studs and brazen was the blade
this on the helm discharged a noble blow the plume dropp nodding to the plain below shorn from the crest atrides waved his steel
deep through his front the weighty falchion fell the crashing bones before its force gave way in dust and blood the groaning hero lay
and fierce atrides spurn him as he bled tore off his arm and loud exulting said thus trojans thus at length be taught to fear race perfidious who delight in war
forced from their ghastly orbs and spouting gore the clotted eye balls tumble on the shore already noble deed ye have perform a princess raped transcends a navy storm
the violated rite the ravish dame our hero slaughter and our ship on flame crimes heap on crimes shall bend your glory down and whelm in ruin yon flagitious town
in such bold feats your impious might approve without th assistance or the fear of which_jove thou great father lord of earth and sky
above the thought of man supremely wise_nestor if from thy hand the fate of mortal flow from whence this favour to an impious foe
the best of things beyond their measure cloy sleep balmy blessing love endearing joy the feast the dance whate er mankind desire even the sweet charm of sacred number tire
a godless crew abandon and unjust still breathing rapine violence and lust but troy for ever reaps a dire delight in thirst of slaughter and in lust of fight
the bloody armour which his train received then sudden mix among the warring crew and the bold son of pylaemenes slew
following his martial father to the war through filial love he left his native shore never ah never to behold it more
his unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling against the target of the spartan king thus of his lance disarm from death he fly and turns around his apprehensive eye
this said he seized while yet the carcase heaved harpalion had through asia travell far him through the hip transpiercing as he fled the shaft of merion mingled with the dead
beneath the bone the glancing point descends and driving down the swelling bladder rends sunk in his sad companions arm he lay and
in short pantings sobb his soul away like some vile worm extended on the ground while life red torrent gush from out the wound
him on his car the paphlagonian train in slow procession bore from off the plain the pensive father father now no more
attends the mournful pomp along the shore and unavailing tear profusely shed and unrevenged deplored his offspring dead paris from far the moving sight beheld
with pity soften and with fury swell his honour host a youth of matchless grace and loved of all the paphlagonian race
with his full strength he bent his angry bow and wing the feather vengeance at the foe a chief there was the brave euchenor named for riches much and more for virtue famed
who held his seat in corinth stately town polydus son a seer of old renown oft had the father told his early doom by arm abroad or slow disease at home
beneath his ear the pointed arrow went the soul came issuing at the narrow vent his limb unnerved drop useless on the ground and everlasting darkness shade him round
he climb his vessel prodigal of breath and chose the certain glorious path to death nor knew great stern_hector how his legions yield
wide on the left the force of greece command and conquest hovers er th achaian band with such a tide superior virtue sway and he that shakes the solid earth gave aid
wrapp in the cloud and tumult of the field but in the centre stern_hector fix remain where first the gate were forced and bulwarks gain
and where low wall confine the beating tide whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides where late in fight both foot and horse engaged and all the thunder of the battle raged there join the whole boeotian strength remains
the proud iaonians with their sweeping train locrians and phthians and th epaean force but join repel not stern_hector fiery course
the flower of athens stichius phidas led bias and great menestheus at their head meges the strong the epaean band controll and dracius prudent and amphion bold the phthians medon famed for martial might and brave podarces active in the fight
there on the margin of the hoary deep their naval station where the ajaces keep this drew from phylacus his noble line
iphiclus son and that oileus thine young oilean_ajax brother by a stolen embrace he dwelt far distant from his native place
by his fierce step dame from his father reign expell and exiled for her brother slain these rule the phthians and their arm employ mix with boeotians on the shore of troy
now side by side with like unwearied care each oilean_ajax laboured through the field of war so when two lordly bulls with equal toil force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil join to one yoke the stubborn earth they tear and trace large furrows with the shining share er their huge limb the foam descends in snow and stream of sweat down their sour foreheads flow
a train of hero followed through the field who bore by turns great oilean_ajax sevenfold shield whene er he breathed remissive of his might tired with the incessant slaughter of the fight
no following troop his brave associate grace in close engagement an unpractised race the locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield nor bear the helm nor lift the moony shield but skill from far the flying shaft to wing or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling dexterous with these
thus in the van the telamonian train throng in bright arm a pressing fight maintain far in the rear the locrian archers lie whose stone and arrow intercept the sky the mingled tempest on the foe they pour troy scattering order open to the shower
now had the greeks eternal fame acquired and the gall ilians to their wall retired but sage polydamas discreetly brave address great stern_hector and this counsel gave though great in all thou seem st averse to lend impartial audience to a faithful friend to god and man thy matchless worth is known
they aim a certain wound or fell the distant warrior to the ground and every art of glorious war thy own
but in cool thought and counsel to excel how widely differs this from warring well content with what the bounteous god have given seek not alone to engross the gift of heaven
to some the power of bloody war belong to some sweet music and the charm of song to few and wondrous few has which_jove assign d
a wise_nestor extensive all considering mind their guardians these the nation round confess and town and empires for their safety bless if heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast attend stern_hector
what i judge the best see as thou mov st on danger danger spread and war whole fury burns around thy head
behold distress within yon hostile wall how many trojans yield disperse or fall what troop out number scarce the war maintain and what brave hero at the ship lie slain
here cease thy fury and the chief and king convoked to council weigh the sum of things whether the god succeeding our desires
to yon tall ship to bear the trojan fire or quit the fleet and pass unhurt away contented with the conquest of the day
i fear i fear lest greece not yet undone pay the large debt of last revolving sun achilles great achilles yet remains on yonder decks and yet erlooks the plain
the counsel pleased and stern_hector with a bound leap from his chariot on the trembling ground swift as he leap his clanging arm resound
to guard this post he cried thy art employ and here detain the scatter youth of troy where yonder hero faint i bend my way and hasten back to end the doubtful day
this said the towering chief prepares to go shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow and seems a moving mountain topp with snow
to panthus son at stern_hector high command haste the bold leader of the trojan band but round the battlements and round the plain for many a chief he look but look in vain deiphobus nor helenus the seer nor asius son nor asius self appear for these were pierced with many a ghastly wound
some cold in death some groaning on the ground some low in dust a mournful object lay high on the wall some breathed their soul away
through all his host inspiring force he fly and bids anew the martial thunder rise far on the left amid the throng he found cheering the troop and dealing death around
the graceful paris whom with fury moved opprobrious thus th impatient chief reproved ill fated paris slave to womankind as smooth of face as fraudulent of mind
where is deiphobus where asius gone the godlike father and th intrepid son the force of helenus dispensing fate and great othryoneus so fear of late
black fate hang o er thee from th avenging god imperial troy from her foundations nods whelm in thy country ruin shalt thou fall and one devouring vengeance swallow all
when paris thus my brother and my friend thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend in other battle i deserved thy blame though then not deedless nor unknown to fame
the chief you seek on yonder shore lie slain of all those hero two alone remain deiphobus and helenus the seer
but since yon rampart by thy arm lay low i scatter slaughter from my fatal bow each now disabled by a hostile spear
go then successful where thy soul inspires this heart and hand shall second all thy fire what with this arm i can prepare to know
till death for death be paid and blow for blow but tis not ours with force not our own to combat strength is of the god alone
around polydamas distain with blood cebrion phalces stern_hector orthaeus stood palmus with polypoetes the divine and two bold brother of hippotion line who reach fair ilion from ascania far the former day the next engaged in war
as when from gloomy cloud a whirlwind spring that bears which_jove thunder on its dreadful wing wide er the blasted field the tempest sweeps then gather settles on the hoary deeps the afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar the wave behind impel the wave before wide rolling foaming high and tumbling to the shore
these word the hero angry mind assuage then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage thus rank on rank the thick battalions throng chief urged on chief and man drove man along
far er the plain in dreadful order bright the brazen arm reflect a beamy light full in the blazing van great stern_hector shined like mars commission to confound mankind
before him flaming his enormous shield like the broad sun illumined all the field his nodding helm emits a streamy ray his piercing eye through all the battle stray and while beneath his targe he flash along shot terror round that
wither e en the strong thus stalk he dreadful death was in his look whole nation fear but not an argive shook
the towering oilean_ajax with an ample stride advanced the first and thus the chief defied stern_hector come on thy empty threats forbear
tis not thy arm tis thundering which_jove we fear the skill of war to us not idly given lo greece is humbled not by troy but
heaven vain are the hope that haughty mind imparts to force our fleet the greeks have hand and heart long ere in flame our lofty navy fall
your boasted city and your god built wall shall sink beneath us smoking on the ground and spread a long unmeasured ruin round
the time shall come when chased along the plain even thou shalt call on which_jove and call in vain even thou shalt wish to aid thy desperate course the wing of falcons for thy flying horse shalt run forgetful of a warrior fame while cloud of friendly dust conceal thy shame
to which_jove glad omen all the grecians rise and hail with shouts his progress through the sky far echoing clamours bound from side to side they ceased and thus the chief of troy replied from whence this menace this insulting strain
as thus he spoke behold in open view on sounding wing a dexter eagle flew enormous boaster doom to vaunt in vain
so may the god on stern_hector life bestow not that short life which mortal lead below but such as those of which_jove high lineage born the blue eyed maid or he that gilds the morn as this decisive day shall end the fame of greece and argos be no more a name
the lance of stern_hector thou shalt meet thy fate that giant corse extended on the shore shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore
he said and like a lion stalk along with shouts incessant earth and ocean rung sent from his following host the grecian train with answering thunder fill the echoing plain a shout that tore heaven concave and above shook the fix splendours of the throne of which_jove
and thou imperious if thy madness wait illustration greek earrings greek earrings book xiv argument juno deceives jupiter by the girdle of venus
wise_nestor sitting at the table with machaon is alarmed with the increasing clamour of war and hastens to agamemnon on his way he meets that prince with diomed and ulysses whom he informs of the extremity of the danger
agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night which ulysses withstands to which diomed adds his advice that wounded as they were they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence which advice is pursued
juno seeing the partiality of jupiter to the trojans form a design to over reach him she sets off her charm with the utmost care and the more surely to enchant him obtains the magic girdle of venus
she then applies herself to the god of sleep and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eye of jupiter
this done she goes to mount ida where the god at first sight is ravished with her beauty sinks in her embraces and is laid asleep
stern_hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by oilean_ajax and carried off from the battle several actions succeed till the trojans much distressed are obliged to give way the lesser oilean_ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner
but not the genial feast nor flowing bowl could charm the care of wise_nestor watchful soul his startled ear the increasing cry attend then thus impatient to his wounded friend what new alarm divine machaon say what mix events attend this mighty day
neptune takes advantage of his slumber and succours the greeks hark how the shouts divide and how they meet and now come full and thicken to the fleet
here with the cordial draught dispel thy care let hecamede the strengthening bath prepare refresh thy wound and cleanse the clotted gore while i the adventures of the day explore
he said and seizing thrasymedes shield his valiant offspring hasten to the field that day the son his father buckler bore
then snatch a lance and issued from the door soon as the prospect open to his view his wounded eye the scene of sorrow knew dire disarray
the tumult of the fight the wall in ruin and the greeks in flight as when old ocean silent surface sleeps the wave just heaving on the purple deeps
while yet the expected tempest hangs on high weighs down the cloud and blackens in the sky the mass of water will no wind obey which_jove sends one gust and bids them roll away
while wavering counsel thus his mind engage fluctuates in doubtful thought the pylian sage to join the host or to the general haste debating long he fixes on the last
yet as he moves the sight his bosom warms the field rings dreadful with the clang of arm the gleaming falchions flash the javelin fly blow echo blow and all or kill or die
by tardy steps ascending from the fleet the king of man ulysses the divine and who to tydeus owes his noble line
in line advanced along the shelving strand whose bay the fleet unable to contain at length beside the margin of the main rank above rank the crowded ship they moor
him in his march the wounded prince meet their ship at distance from the battle stand who landed first lay highest on the shore
supported on the spear they took their way unfit to fight but anxious for the day wise_nestor approach alarm each grecian breast whom thus the general of the host address
grace and glory of the achaian name what drives thee wise_nestor from the field of fame shall then proud stern_hector see his boast fulfill
our fleet in ashes and our hero kill such was his threat ah now too soon made good on many a grecian bosom writ in blood
is every heart inflamed with equal rage against your king nor will one chief engage and have i lived to see with mournful eye
in every greek a new achilles rise gerenian wise_nestor then so fate has will and all confirming time has fate fulfill
the wall our late inviolable bound and best defence lies smoking on the ground even to the ship their conquering arm extend and groans of
not he that thunder from the aerial bower not which_jove himself upon the past has power slaughter greeks to heaven ascend
on speedy measures then employ your thought in such distress if counsel profit aught arm cannot much though mars our soul incite these gaping wound withhold us from the fight
to him the monarch that our army bends that troy triumphant our high fleet ascends and that the rampart late our surest trust and best defence lies smoking in the dust all this from which_jove afflictive hand we bear who far from argos wills our ruin here
past are the day when happier greece was blest and all his favour all his aid confess now heaven averse our hand from battle ties and lifts the trojan glory to the sky
cease we at length to waste our blood in vain and launch what ship lie nearest to the main leave these at anchor till the coming night
then if impetuous troy forbear the fight bring all to sea and hoist each sail for flight better from evils well foreseen to run than perish in the danger we may shun
thus he the sage ulysses thus replies while anger flash from his disdainful eye what shameful word unkingly as thou art
fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart oh were thy sway the curse of meaner power and thou the shame of any host but ours
a host by which_jove endued with martial might and taught to conquer or to fall in fight adventurous combat and bold war to wage employ our youth and yet employs our age
and wilt thou thus desert the trojan plain and have whole stream of blood been spilt in vain in such base sentence if thou couch thy fear speak it in whispers lest a greek should hear
life there a man so dead to fame who dares to think such meanness or the thought declares and comes it even from him whose sovereign sway the banded legions of all greece obey
is this a general voice that calls to flight while war hangs doubtful while his soldiers fight what more could troy
no more the troop our hoisted sails in view themselves abandon shall the fight pursue but thy ship flying with despair shall see and owe destruction to a prince like thee

though sore of battle though with wound oppress let each go forth and animate the rest advance the glory which he cannot share though not partaker witness of the war
beyond the missile javelin sounding flight safe let us stand and from the tumult far inspire the rank and rule the distant war
but lest new wound on wound erpower us quite he added not the listening king obey slow moving on atrides leads the way
the god of ocean to inflame their rage appears a warrior furrowed er with age press in his own the general hand he took and thus the venerable hero spoke atrides lo
with what disdainful eye achilles sees his country force fly blind impious man whose anger is his guide who glory in unutterable pride
o er yonder sands soon shall thou view the scattered trojan band fly diverse while proud king and chief renown driven heap on heap with cloud involved around of rolling dust their winged wheels employ to hide their ignominious head in troy
so may he perish so may which_jove disclaim the wretch relentless and erwhelm with shame but heaven forsakes not thee
he spoke then rush amid the warrior crew and sent his voice before him as he flew loud as the shout encountering army yield when twice ten thousand shake the labouring field such was the voice and such the thundering sound of him whose trident rends the solid ground
meantime saturnia from olympus brow high throned in gold beheld the field below with joy the glorious conflict she survey where her great brother gave the grecians aid
each argive bosom beats to meet the fight and grisly war appears a pleasing sight but placed aloft on ida shady height she sees her which_jove and trembles at the sight
at length she trusts her power resolved to prove the old yet still successful cheat of love against his wisdom to oppose her charm and lull the lord of thunder in her arm
swift to her bright apartment she repairs sacred to dress and beauty pleasing care with skill divine had vulcan form the bower
which_jove to deceive what methods shall she try what art to blind his all beholding eye safe from access of each intruding power
here first she bathes and round her body pours soft oils of fragrance and ambrosial showers the wind perfumed the balmy gale convey through heaven through earth and all the aerial way spirit divine
touch with her secret key the doors unfold self closed behind her shut the valves of gold whose exhalation greets the sense of god with more than mortal sweets

round a golden zone her swelling bosom bound far beaming pendants tremble in her ear each gem illumined with a triple star
then er her head she cast a veil more white than new fallen snow and dazzling as the light last her fair foot celestial sandals grace
thus issuing radiant with majestic pace forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves and calls the mother of the smiles and love
how long to venus thus apart she cried shall human strife celestial mind divide ah yet will venus aid saturnia joy and set aside the cause of greece and troy
then grant me said the queen those conquering charm that power which mortal and immortals warms that love which melts mankind in fierce desires and burns the son of heaven with sacred fire
let heaven dread empress cytheraea said speak her request and deem her will obey for lo i haste to those remote abodes where the great parent sacred source of god

in this was every art and every charm to win the wisest and the coldest warm fond love the gentle vow the gay desire the kind deceit the still reviving fire persuasive speech and the more persuasive sighs silence that spoke and eloquence of eye
she said with various skill and high embroidery graced this on her hand the cyprian goddess laid take this and with it all thy wish she said
with smiles she took the charm and smiling press the powerful cestus to her snowy breast then venus to the courts of which_jove withdrew whilst from olympus pleased saturnia flew

then swift as wind er lemnos smoky isle they wing their way and imbrus sea beat soil through air unseen involved in darkness glide and light on lectos on the point of ide mother of savages whose echoing hill are heard resounding with a hundred rills
there on a fir whose spiry branches rise to join its summit to the neighbouring sky dark in embowering shade conceal from sight sat sleep in likeness of the bird of night
fair ida trembles underneath the god hush are her mountain and her forests nod chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth but call cymindis by the race of earth
the god whose lightning sets the heaven on fire through all his bosom feels the fierce desire fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charm mix with her soul and melted in her arm
to ida top successful juno fly great which_jove surveys her with desiring eye fix on her eye he fed his eager look
then press her hand and thus with transport spoke why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky and not her steed and flaming chariot nigh
then she i haste to those remote abodes where the great parent of the deathless god the reverend ocean and gray tethys reign on the last limits of the land and main
i visit these to whose indulgent care i owe the nursing of my tender year for strife i hear has made that union cease which held so long that ancient pair in peace
wait under ide of thy superior power to ask consent i leave the olympian bower nor seek unknown to thee the sacred cells deep under sea where hoary ocean dwells
the steed prepared my chariot to convey er earth and sea and through the aerial way for that said which_jove suffice another day
but eager love denies the least delay let softer care the present hour employ and be these moments sacred all to joy
ne er did my soul so strong a passion prove or for an earthly or a heavenly love not when i press ixion matchless dame whence rose pirithous like the god in fame not when fair danae felt the shower of gold stream into life whence perseus brave and bold
not thus i burn for either theban dame bacchus from this from that alcides came nor phoenix daughter beautiful and young whence godlike rhadamanth and minos sprung
not thus i burn for fair latona face nor comelier ceres more majestic grace not thus even for thyself i felt desire
he spoke the goddess with the charming eye glows with celestial red and thus replies is this a scene for love
our joy profaned by each familiar eye the sport of heaven and fable of the sky how shall i er review the blest abodes or mix among the senate of the god
as now my veins receive the pleasing fire on ida height exposed to mortal and immortal sight shall i not think that with disorder charm all heaven beholds me recent from thy arm
with skill divine has vulcan form thy bower sacred to love and to the genial hour if such thy will to that recess retire in secret there indulge thy soft desire
she ceased and smiling with superior love thus answer mild the cloud compelling which_jove nor god nor mortal shall our joy behold shaded with cloud and circumfused in gold
not even the sun who dart through heaven his rays and whose broad eye the extended earth surveys gazing he spoke and kindling at the view his eager arm around the goddess threw
glad earth perceives and from her bosom pours unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers thick new born violets a soft carpet spread and clustering lotos swell the rising bed and sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow
and flamy crocus made the mountain glow there golden cloud conceal the heavenly pair steep in soft joy and circumfused with air celestial dews descending er the ground perfume the mount and breathe ambrosia round at length with love and sleep soft power oppress the panting thunderer nods and sinks to rest
now to the navy borne on silent wing to neptune ear soft sleep his message brings beside him sudden unperceived he stood and thus with gentle word address the god
now neptune now the important hour employ to check a while the haughty hope of troy while which_jove yet rests while yet my vapours shed the golden vision round his sacred head for juno love and somnus pleasing ties have closed those awful and eternal eye
neptune with zeal increased renews his care and towering in the foremost rank of war indignant thus oh once of martial fame
thus having said the power of slumber flew on human lids to drop the balmy dew greeks if yet ye can deserve the name
this half recover day shall troy obtain shall stern_hector thunder at your ship again lo still he vaunts and threats the fleet with fire while stern_hector achilles in his wrath retires
one hero loss too tamely you deplore be still yourselves and ye shall need no more oh yet if glory any bosom warms brace on your firmest helms and stand to arm
his strongest spear each valiant grecian wield each valiant grecian seize his broadest shield let to the weak the lighter arm belong the ponderous targe be wielded by the strong
thus arm not stern_hector shall our presence stay myself ye greeks myself will lead the way illustration greek shield greek shield
the troop assent their martial arm they change the busy chief their banded legions range the king though wounded and oppress with pain with helpful hand themselves assist the train
the strong and cumbrous arm the valiant wield the weaker warrior takes a lighter shield thus sheath in shining brass in bright array the legions march and neptune leads the way
his brandish falchion flame before their eye like lightning flashing through the frighted sky clad in his might the earth shaking power appears pale mortal tremble and confess their fear
troy great defender stands alone unawed arm his proud host and dares oppose a god and lo the god and wondrous man appear the sea stern_hector ruler there and stern_hector here
the roaring main at her great master call rose in huge rank and form a watery wall around the ship sea hanging er the shore both army join earth thunder ocean roars
the bellowing deeps resound when stormy wind disclose the dark profound less loud the wind that from the ćolian hall roar through the wood and make whole forests fall less loud the wood when flame in torrents pour catch the dry mountain and its shade devour with such a rage the meeting host are driven and such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven
the first bold javelin urged by stern_hector force direct at oilean_ajax bosom winged its course but there no pass the crossing belts afford
not half so loud one braced his shield and one sustain his sword then back the disappointed trojan drew and cursed the lance that unavailing flew
but scaped not oilean_ajax his tempestuous hand a ponderous stone upheaving from the sand where heap laid loose beneath the warrior foot or served to ballast or to prop the fleet toss round and round the missive marble flings on the razed shield the fallen ruin rings full on his breast and throat with force descends nor deaden there its giddy fury spends but whirling on with many a fiery round smokes in the dust and ploughs into the ground
as when the bolt red hissing from above dart on the consecrated plant of which_jove the mountain oak in flaming ruin lies black from the blow and smokes of sulphur rise stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand and own the terror of the almighty hand
so lies great stern_hector prostrate on the shore his slacken hand deserts the lance it bore his following shield the fallen chief erspread
beneath his helmet dropp his fainting head his load of armour sinking to the ground clanks on the field a dead and hollow sound
loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain greece sees in hope troy great defender slain all spring to seize him storm of arrow fly and thicker javelin intercept the sky
in vain an iron tempest hisses round he lies protected and without a wound polydamas agenor the divine the pious warrior of anchises line and each bold leader of the lycian band with covering shield a friendly circle stand his mournful followers with assistant care the groaning hero to his chariot bear his foaming courser swifter than the wind speed to the town and leave the war behind
when now they touch the mead enamell side where gentle xanthus rolls his easy tide with watery drops the chief they sprinkle round placed on the margin of the flowery ground
raised on his knees he now ejects the gore now faints anew low sinking on the shore by fits he breathes half view the fleeting sky and seals again by fits his swimming eye
soon as the greeks the chief retreat beheld with double fury each invades the field oilean_ajax first his javelin sped pierced by whose point the son of enops bled
satnius the brave whom beauteous neis bore amidst her flocks on satnio silver shore struck through the belly rim the warrior lies supine and shade eternal veil his eye
an arduous battle rose around the dead by turns the greeks by turns the trojans bled fired with revenge polydamas drew near
and at prothoenor shook the trembling spear the driving javelin through his shoulder thrust he sinks to earth and grasps the bloody dust
we rule the field and thus their arm the race of panthus wield from this unerring hand there fly no dart
lo thus the victor cry but bathes its point within a grecian heart propp on that spear to which thou owest thy fall
go guide thy darksome steps to pluto dreary hall he said and sorrow touch each argive breast the soul of oilean_ajax burn above the rest
as by his side the groaning warrior fell at the fierce foe he launch his piercing steel the foe reclining shunn the flying death but fate archilochus demands thy breath
swift to perform heaven fatal will it fled full on the juncture of the neck and head and took the joint and cut the nerves in twain the dropping head first tumbled on the plain
thy lofty birth no succour could impart the wing of death ertook thee on the dart so just the stroke that yet the body stood erect then roll along the sands in blood
here proud polydamas here turn thy eye the towering oilean_ajax loud insulting cry say is this chief extended on the plain a worthy vengeance for prothoenor slain
nor speak him vulgar nor of vulgar race some line methinks may make his lineage known antenor brother or perhaps his son
mark well his port his figure and his face he spake and smiled severe for well he knew the bleeding youth
troy sadden at the view but furious acamas avenged his cause as promachus his slaughtered brother draws he pierced his heart such fate attends you all proud argives
destined by our arm to fall not troy alone but haughty greece shall share the toil the sorrow and the wound of war
behold your promachus deprived of breath a victim owed to my brave brother death not unappeased he enters pluto gate who leaves a brother to revenge his fate
heart piercing anguish struck the grecian host but touch the breast of bold peneleus most at the proud boaster he directs his course
but young ilioneus received the spear ilioneus his father only care phorbas the rich of all the trojan train whom hermes loved and taught the art of gain
full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall and from the fibres scoop the rooted ball drove through the neck and hurl him to the plain he lifts his miserable arm in vain
the boaster fly and shuns superior force swift his broad falchion fierce peneleus spread and from the spouting shoulder struck his head
to earth at once the head and helmet fly the lance yet sticking through the bleeding eye the victor seized and as aloft he shook the gory visage thus insulting spoke trojans
haste to his father let the tale be told let his high roofs resound with frantic woe such as the house of promachus must know let doleful tidings greet his mother ear such as to promachus sad spouse we bear
your great ilioneus behold when we victorious shall to greece return and the pale matron in our triumphs mourn dreadful he spoke then toss the head on high the trojans hear they tremble and they fly
aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall and dread the ruin that impends on all daughter of which_jove that on olympus shine ye all beholding all recording nine
o say when neptune made proud ilion yield what chief what hero first embrued the field of all the grecians what immortal name and whose bless trophies will ye raise to fame
thou first great oilean_ajax on the unsanguined plain laid hyrtius leader of the mysian train phalces and mermer wise_nestor son erthrew bold merion morys and hippotion slew
strong periphaetes and prothoon bled by teucer arrow mingled with the dead pierced in the flank by great_menelaus steel his people pastor hyperenor fell eternal darkness wrapp the warrior round and the fierce soul came rushing through the wound
but stretch in heap before oileus son fall mighty number mighty number run oilean_ajax the less of all the grecian race skill in pursuit and swiftest in the chase
jupiter awaking sees the trojans repulsed from the trenches stern_hector in a swoon and neptune at the head of the greeks he is highly incensed at the artifice of juno who appeases him by her submissions she is then sent to iris and apollo
juno repairing to the assembly of the god attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against jupiter in particular she touches mars with a violent resentment he is ready to take arm but is prevented by minerva
iris and apollo obey the order of jupiter iris command neptune to leave the battle to which after much reluctance and passion he consents
apollo reinspires stern_hector with vigour brings him back to the battle marches before him with his aegis and turns the fortune of the fight
he breaks down great part of the grecian wall the trojans rush in and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet but are as yet repelled by the greater oilean_ajax with a prodigious slaughter
illustration bacchus bacchus book xv argument the fifth battle at the ship and the acts of oilean_ajax now in swift flight they pass the trench profound and many a chief lay gasping on the ground
then stopp and panted where the chariot lie fear on their cheek and horror in their eye meanwhile awaken from his dream of love on ida summit sat imperial which_jove
round the wide field he cast a careful view there saw the trojans fly the greeks pursue these proud in arm those scatter o er the plain
not far great stern_hector on the dust he spies his sad associates round with weeping eye ejecting blood and panting yet for breath
and midst the war the monarch of the main his sense wandering to the verge of death the god beheld him with a pitying look and thus incensed to fraudful juno
spoke thou still adverse to the eternal will for ever studious in promoting ill thy art have made the godlike stern_hector yield and driven his conquering squadrons from the field
canst thou unhappy in thy wiles withstand our power immense and brave the almighty hand hast thou forgot when bound and fix on high
from the vast concave of the spangled sky i hung thee trembling in a golden chain and all the raging god opposed in vain
headlong i hurl them from the olympian hall stunn in the whirl and breathless with the fall for godlike hercules these deed were done nor seem the vengeance worthy such a son
when by thy wiles induced fierce boreas toss the shipwreck hero on the coan coast him through a thousand form of death i bore and sent to argos and his native shore
hear this remember and our fury dread nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head lest art and blandishments successless prove thy soft deceits and well dissembled love
by every oath that power immortal ties the foodful earth and all infolding sky by thy black wave tremendous styx that flow through the drear realm of gliding ghosts below by the dread honour of thy sacred head and that unbroken vow our virgin bed
not by my art the ruler of the main steeps troy in blood and ranges round the plain by his own ardour his own pity sway to help his greeks he fought and disobey
the thunderer spoke imperial juno mourn and trembling these submissive word return else had thy juno better counsel given and taught submission to the sire of heaven
think st thou with me fair empress of the sky the immortal father with a smile replies then soon the haughty sea god shall obey nor dare to act
if truth inspires thy tongue proclaim our will to yon bright synod on the olympian hill our high decree let various iris know and call the god that bears the silver bow
but when we point the way let her descend and from the embattled plain command the sea god to his watery reign
while phoebus hastes great stern_hector to prepare to rise afresh and once more wake the war his labouring bosom re inspires with breath and calls his sense from the verge of death
greece chased by troy even to achilles fleet shall fall by thousands at the hero foot he not untouch with pity to
the plain shall send patroclus but shall send in vain what youth he slaughter under ilion wall even my loved son divine sarpedon fall
vanquish at last by stern_hector lance he lies then nor till then shall great achilles rise and lo that instant godlike stern_hector dies
from that great hour the war whole fortune turns pallas assists and lofty ilion burns not till that day shall which_jove relax his rage
the promise of a god i gave and seal it with the almighty nod achilles glory to the stars to raise such was our word and fate the word obeys
nor one of all the heavenly host engage in aid of greece the trembling queen the almighty order given swift from the idaean summit shot to heaven
he trod before sends forth his active mind from place to place joins hill to dale and measures space with space
as some wayfaring man who wanders er in thought a length of land so swift flew juno to the bless abodes
if thought of man can match the speed of god there sat the power in awful synod placed they bow and made obeisance as she pass d
through all the brazen dome with goblets crown they hail her queen the nectar stream around fair themis first presents the golden bowl and anxious asks what care disturb her soul
to whom the white arm goddess thus replies enough thou know st the tyrant of the sky severely bent his purpose to fulfil unmoved his mind and unrestrain his will
go thou the feasts of heaven attend thy call bid the crown nectar circle round the hall but which_jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome such stern_hector decrees such threaten woe to come
as soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise and damp the eternal banquets of the sky the goddess said and sullen took her place
to see the gathering grudge in every breast smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express while on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bent sat stedfast care and lowering discontent
black horror sadden each celestial face thus she proceeds attend ye power above but know tis madness to contest with which_jove supreme he sits and sees in pride of sway
your vassal godheads grudgingly obey fierce in the majesty of power controls shakes all the throne of heaven and bends the poles
submiss immortals all he wills obey and thou great mars begin and show the way behold ascalaphus behold him die but dare not murmur dare not vent a sigh
thy own loved boasted offspring lies erthrown if that loved boasted offspring be thy own stern_hector mars with anguish for his slaughter son smote his rebelling breast and fierce begun
thus shall mars obey forgive me god and yield my vengeance way descending first to yon forbidden plain the god of battle dares avenge the slain
thus then immortals dares though the thunder bursting er my head should hurl me blazing on those heap of dead
with that he gives command to fear and flight to join his rapid courser for the fight then grim in arm with hasty vengeance fly
discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven but pallas springing through the bright abode starts from her azure throne to calm the god
arm that reflect a radiance through the sky and now had which_jove by bold rebellion driven struck for the immortal race with timely fear from frantic mars
the shield and spear then the huge helmet lifting from his head thus to the impetuous homicide she said by what wild passion furious
she snatch art thou toss striv st thou with which_jove thou art already lost shall not the thunderer dread command restrain and was imperial juno heard in vain
ilion and greece no more should which_jove engage the sky would yield an ampler scene of rage guilty and guiltless find an equal fate and one vast ruin whelm the olympian state
back to the sky wouldst thou with shame be driven and in thy guilt involve the host of heaven cease then thy offspring death unjust to call hero as great have died and yet shall fall
why should heaven law with foolish man comply exempted from the race ordain to die this menace fix the warrior to his throne sullen he sat and curb the rising groan
then juno call which_jove order to obey the winged iris and the god of day go wait the thunderer will saturnia cried
on yon tall summit of the fountful ide there in the father awful presence stand receive and execute his dread command
she said and sat the god that gilds the day and various iris wing their airy way swift as the wind to ida hill they came fair nurse of fountains and of savage game
there sat the eternal he whose nod controls the trembling world and shakes the steady poles veil in a mist of fragrance him
they found with cloud of gold and purple circled round well pleased the thunderer saw their earnest care and prompt obedience to the queen of air
then while a smile serenes his awful brow command the goddess of the showery bow iris descend and what we here ordain
report to yon mad tyrant of the main bid him from fight to his own deeps repair or breathe from slaughter in the field of air
if he refuse then let him timely weigh our elder birthright and superior sway how shall his rashness stand the dire alarm if heaven omnipotence descend in arm
strives he with me by whom his power was given and is there equal to the lord of heaven the all mighty spoke the goddess wing d
swift as the rattling hail or fleecy snows drive through the sky when boreas fiercely blow so from the cloud descending iris fall and to blue neptune thus the goddess calls
in me behold the messenger of which_jove he bids thee from forbidden war repair to thine own deeps or to the field of air
her flight to sacred ilion from the idaean height attend the mandate of the sire above this if refused he bids thee timely weigh his elder birthright and superior sway
how shall thy rashness stand the dire alarm if heaven omnipotence descend in arm striv st thou with him by whom all power is given
and art thou equal to the lord of heaven what means the haughty sovereign of the sky the king of ocean thus incensed replies
i three brother deities from saturn came and ancient rhea earth immortal dame assign by lot our triple rule we know infernal pluto sways the shade below
o er the wide cloud and er the starry plain ethereal which_jove extends his high domain my court beneath the hoary wave i keep and hush the roarings of the sacred deep olympus and this earth in common lie what claim has here the tyrant of the sky
rule as he will his portion realm on high no vassal god nor of his train am far in the distant cloud let him control
and awe the younger brother of the pole there to his children his command be given the trembling servile second race of heaven
and must i then said she sire of flood bear this fierce answer to the king of god correct it yet and change thy rash intent a noble mind disdains not to repent
to elder brother guardian fiends are given to scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven great is the profit thus the god rejoin
when ministers are blest with prudent mind warn by thy word to powerful which_jove i yield and quit though angry the contended field not but his threats with justice i disclaim the same our honour and our birth the same
if yet forgetful of his promise given to hermes pallas and the queen of heaven to favour ilion that perfidious place he breaks his faith with half the ethereal race give him to know unless the grecian train lay yon proud structures level with the plain howe er the offence by other god
be pass the wrath of neptune shall for ever last thus speaking furious from the field he strode and plunged into the bosom of the flood
the lord of thunder from his lofty height beheld and thus bespoke the source of light behold the god whose liquid arm are hurl d
around the globe whose earthquakes rock the world desists at length his rebel war to wage seeks his own sea and trembles at our rage else had my wrath heaven throne all shaking round burn to the bottom of his sea profound and all the god that round old saturn dwell had heard the thunder to the deeps of hell
well was the crime and well the vengeance spared even power immense had found such battle hard go thou my son
the trembling greeks alarm shake my broad aegis on thy active arm be godlike stern_hector thy peculiar care swell his bold heart and urge his strength to war
let ilion conquer till the achaian train fly to their ship and hellespont again then greece shall breathe from toil
not half so swift the sailing falcon fly that drives a turtle through the liquid sky as phoebus shooting from the idaean brow glides down the mountain to the plain below
there stern_hector seated by the stream he sees his sense returning with the coming breeze again his pulses beat his spirit rise again his loved companions meet his eye which_jove thinking of his pain they pass away to whom the god who gives the golden day why sits great stern_hector from the field so far
the godhead said his will divine the son of which_jove obey what grief what wound withholds thee from the war
the fainting hero as the vision bright stood shining er him half unseal his sight what blest immortal with commanding breath thus wakens stern_hector from the sleep of death
has fame not told how while my trusty sword bathed greece in slaughter and her battle gored the mighty oilean_ajax with a deadly blow had almost sunk me to the shade below
even yet methinks the gliding ghosts i spy and hell black horror swim before my eye to him apollo be no more dismay see and be strong
the thunderer sends thee aid behold thy phoebus shall his arm employ phoebus propitious still to thee and troy inspire thy warrior then with manly force
and to the ship impel thy rapid horse even i will make thy fiery courser way and drive the grecians headlong to the sea
as when the pamper steed with rein unbound breaks from his stall and pours along the ground with ample strokes he rushes to the flood to bathe his side and cool his fiery blood his head now freed he tosses to the sky his mane dishevell o er his shoulder fly he snuffs the females in the well known plain and spring exulting to his field again urged by the voice divine thus stern_hector flew full of the god and all his host pursue
as when the force of man and dog combined invade the mountain goat or branching hind far from the hunter rage secure they lie close in the rock not fated yet to die
thus to bold stern_hector spoke the son of which_jove and breathed immortal ardour from above when lo a lion shoots across the way
they fly at once the chasers and the prey so greece that late in conquering troop pursued and mark their progress through the rank in blood
thoas with grief observed his dreadful course thoas the bravest of the ćtolian force skill to direct the javelin distant flight and bold to combat in the standing fight not more in council famed for solid sense than winning word and heavenly eloquence
soon as they see the furious chief appear forget to vanquish and consent to fear god what portent he cried these eye invades
we saw him late by thundering oilean_ajax kill what god restores him to the frighted field and not content that half of greece lie slain pours new destruction on her son again
lo stern_hector rises from the stygian shade he comes not which_jove without thy powerful will lo still he life pursues and conquers still
yet hear my counsel and his worst withstand the greeks main body to the fleet command but let the few whom brisker spirit warm stand the first onset and provoke the storm
thus point your arm and when such foe appear fierce as he is let stern_hector learn to fear the warrior spoke the listening greeks obey thickening their rank and form a deep array
each oilean_ajax teucer merion gave command the valiant leader of the cretan band and mars like meges these the chief excite approach the foe and meet the coming fight
behind unnumber multitudes attend to flank the navy and the shore defend full on the front the pressing trojans bear and stern_hector first came towering to the war
phoebus himself the rushing battle led a veil of cloud involved his radiant head high held before him which_jove enormous shield portentous shone and shaded all the field
vulcan to which_jove the immortal gift consign to scatter host and terrify mankind the greeks expect the shock the clamours rise from different part and mingle in the sky
dire was the hiss of dart by hero flung and arrow leaping from the bow string sung these drink the life of generous warrior slain those guiltless fall and thirst for blood in vain
as long as phoebus bore unmoved the shield sat doubtful conquest hovering er the field but when aloft he shakes it in the sky shouts in their ear and lightens in their eye deep horror seizes every grecian breast their force is humbled and their fear confess
scatter wide no swain to guard them and no day to guide when two fell lion from the mountain come and spread the carnage through the shady gloom

the greeks dismay confused disperse or fall some seek the trench some skulk behind the wall while these fly trembling other pant for breath

easy as when ashore an infant stands and draws imagined houses in the sands the sportive wanton pleased with some new play sweeps the slight work and fashion domes away thus vanish at thy touch the tower and wall the toil of thousands in a moment fall
the grecians gaze around with wild despair confused and weary all the power with prayer exhort their man with praise threats command and urge the god with voice eye and hand

this day preserve our navy from the flame and save the relics of the grecian name thus prayed the sage the eternal gave consent and peals of thunder shook the firmament
as when black tempests mix the sea and sky the roaring deeps in watery mountain rise above the side of some tall ship ascend its womb they deluge and its ribs they rend thus loudly roaring and erpowering all mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall legions on legions from each side arise thick sound the keels the storm of arrow fly
presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign and catch new fury at the voice divine fierce on the ship above the car below these wield the mace and those the javelin throw
while thus the thunder of the battle raged and labouring army round the work engaged still in the tent patroclus sat to tend the good eurypylus his wounded friend

he sprinkles healing balms to anguish kind and adds discourse the medicine of the mind express he wrings his hand he beats his manly breast
though yet thy state require redress he cry depart i must what horror strike my eye charged with achilles high command i go
a mournful witness of this scene of woe i haste to urge him by his country care to rise in arm and shine again in war
perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend the voice is powerful of a faithful friend he spoke and speaking swifter than the wind sprung from the tent and left the war behind
the embodied greeks the fierce attack sustain but strive though numerous to repulse in vain nor could the trojans through that firm array force to the fleet and tent the impervious way
as when a shipwright with palladian art smooths the rough wood and levels every part with equal hand he guides his whole design
by the just rule and the directing line the martial leader with like skill and care preserved their line and equal kept the war
at one proud bark high towering er the fleet oilean_ajax the great and godlike stern_hector meet for one bright prize the matchless chief contend nor this the ship can fire nor that defend
brave deed of arm through all the rank were tried and every ship sustained an equal tide one kept the shore and one the vessel trod that fix as fate this acted by a god
the son of clytius in his daring hand the deck approaching shakes a flaming brand but pierced by ajax_telamon huge lance expires thundering he fall and drops the extinguish fire
great stern_hector view him with a sad survey as stretch in dust before the stern_hector he lay oh all of trojan all of lycian race
stand to your arm maintain this arduous space lo where the son of royal clytius lies ah save his arm secure his obsequies
this said his eager javelin sought the foe but oilean_ajax shunn the meditated blow not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown it stretch in dust
an exile long sustain at oilean_ajax board a faithful servant to a foreign lord in peace and war for ever at his side near his loved master as he lived he died
unhappy lycophron from the high poop he tumbles on the sand and lies a lifeless load along the land with anguish oilean_ajax view the piercing sight and thus inflames his brother to the fight
teucer behold extended on the shore our friend our loved companion now no more dear as a parent with a parent care to fight our war he left his native air
this death deplored to stern_hector rage we owe revenge revenge it on the cruel foe where are those dart on which the fate attend
and where the bow which phoebus taught to bend impatient teucer hastening to his aid before the chief his ample bow display d
the well stored quiver on his shoulder hung then hiss his arrow and the bowstring sung clytus pisenor son renown in fame to thee polydamas
an honour name drove through the thickest of the embattled plain the startling steed and shook his eager rein as all on glory ran his ardent mind the pointed death arrests him from behind
hurl from the lofty seat at distance far the headlong courser spurn his empty car till sad polydamas the steed restrain and gave astynous to thy careful hand then fired to vengeance rush amidst the foe
through his fair neck the thrilling arrow fly in youth first bloom reluctantly he dies rage edged his sword and strengthen every blow
once more bold teucer in his country cause at stern_hector breast a chosen arrow draws and had the weapon found the destined way thy fall great trojan had renown that day
but stern_hector was not doom to perish then the all wise_nestor disposer of the fate of man imperial which_jove his present death withstands nor was such glory due to teucer hand
at its full stretch as the tough string he drew struck by an arm unseen it burst in two down dropp the bow the shaft with brazen head fell innocent
some god propitious to the trojan foe has from my arm unfailing struck the bow and broke the nerve my hand had twined with art strong to impel the flight of many a dart
since heaven command it oilean_ajax made reply dismiss the bow and lay thy arrow by thy arm no less suffice the lance to wield and quit the quiver for the ponderous shield
and on the dust lay dead the astonish archer to great oilean_ajax cry some god prevents our destined enterprise in the first rank indulge thy thirst of fame thy brave example shall the rest inflame
fierce as they are by long successes vain to force our fleet or even a ship to gain asks toil and sweat and blood their utmost might shall find its match no more tis ours to fight
then teucer laid his faithless bow aside the fourfold buckler er his shoulder tied on his brave head a crested helm he placed with nodding horse hair formidably graced a dart whose point with brass refulgent shines the warrior wields and his great brother joins
this stern_hector saw and thus express his joy ye troop of lycia dardanus and troy be mindful of yourselves your ancient fame and spread your glory with the navy flame
which_jove is with us i saw his hand but now from the proud archer strike his vaunted bow indulgent which_jove how plain thy favours shine when happy nation bear the marks divine
how easy then to see the sinking state of realm accursed deserted reprobate such is the fate of greece and such is ours behold ye warrior and exert your power
death is the worst a fate which all must try and for our country tis a bliss to die the gallant man though slain in fight he be yet leaves his nation safe his children free
entails a debt on all the grateful state his own brave friend shall glory in his fate his wife live honour all his race succeed
and late posterity enjoy the deed this roused the soul in every trojan breast the godlike oilean_ajax next his greeks address
how long ye warrior of the argive race to generous argos what a dire disgrace how long on these cursed confines will ye lie yet undetermined or to live or die
what hope remain what methods to retire if once your vessel catch the trojan fire make how the flame approach how near they fall how stern_hector calls and troy obeys his call
tis now no time for wisdom or debates to your own hand are trusted all your fate and better far in one decisive strife one day should end our labour or our life than keep this hard got inch of barren sands still press and press by such inglorious hand
not to the dance that dreadful voice invites it calls to death and all the rage of fight the listening grecians feel their leader flame and every kindling bosom pants for fame
then mutual slaughter spread on either side by stern_hector here the phocian schedius died there pierced by oilean_ajax sunk laodamas chief of the foot of old antenor race
his lance bold meges at the victor threw the victor stooping from the death withdrew that valued life phoebus was thy care
but croesmus bosom took the flying spear his corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore his radiant arm triumphant meges bore
dolops the son of lampus rushes on sprung from the race of old laomedon and famed for prowess in a well fought field he pierced the centre of his sounding shield but meges phyleus ample breastplate wore well known in fight on selle winding shore
polydamas laid otus on the sand the fierce commander of the epeian band for king euphetes gave the golden mail compact and firm with many a jointed scale
full at the trojan head he urged his lance where the high plumes above the helmet dance new ting with tyrian dye in dust below shorn from the crest the purple honour glow
which oft in city storm and battle won had saved the father and now saves the son meantime their fight the spartan king survey and stood by meges side a sudden aid
through dolops shoulder urged his forceful dart which held its passage through the panting heart and issued at his breast with thundering sound the warrior fall extended on the ground
in rush the conquering greeks to spoil the slain but stern_hector voice excites his kindred train the hero most from hicetaon sprung fierce melanippus gallant brave and young
he ere to troy the grecians cross the main fed his large oxen on percote plain but when oppress his country
claim his care return to ilion and excell in war for this in priam court he held his place beloved no less than priam royal race

he fall to two at once a prey and lo they bear the bloody arm away come on a distant war no longer wage but hand to hand thy country foe engage
till greece at once and all her glory end or ilion from her towery height descend heaved from the lowest stone and bury all in one sad sepulchre one common fall
stern_hector this said rush forward on the foe with equal ardour melanippus glows then oilean_ajax thus greeks respect your fame
let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire and catch from breast to breast the noble fire on valour side the odds of combat lie the brave live glorious or lamented die
respect yourselves and learn an honest shame the wretch that trembles in the field of fame meets death and worse than death eternal shame
his generous sense he not in vain imparts it sunk and rooted in the grecian heart they join they throng they thicken at his call and flank the navy with a brazen wall shield touching shield in order blaze above and stop the trojans though impell by which_jove
the fiery spartan first with loud applause warms the bold son of wise_nestor in his cause is there he said in arm a youth like you so strong to fight so active to pursue
why stand you distant nor attempt a deed lift the bold lance and make some trojan bleed he said and backward to the line retired forth rush d
the youth with martial fury fired beyond the foremost rank his lance he threw and round the black battalions cast his view
advancing melanippus met the dart with his bold breast and felt it in his heart thundering he fall his falling arm resound and his broad buckler rings against the ground
the troop of troy recede with sudden fear while the swift javelin hiss along in air the victor leaps upon his prostrate prize
thus on a roe the well breath beagle fly and rends his side fresh bleeding with the dart the distant hunter sent into his heart
observing stern_hector to the rescue flew bold as he was antilochus withdrew so when a savage ranging er the plain has torn the shepherd dog or shepherd swain
while conscious of the deed he glares around and hears the gathering multitude resound timely he fly the yet untasted food and gains the friendly shelter of the wood
so fear the youth all troy with shouts pursue while stone and dart in mingled tempest flew but enter in the grecian rank he turns his manly breast and with new fury burns
the sire of god confirming thetis prayer the grecian ardour quench in deep despair but lifts to glory troy prevailing band swells all their heart and strengthens all their hand
now on the fleet the tide of trojans drove fierce to fulfil the stern_hector decrees of which_jove on ida top he waits with longing eye to view the navy blazing to the sky
these fate revolved in his almighty mind he raises stern_hector to the work design bids him with more than mortal fury glow and drives him like a lightning on the foe
then nor till then the scale of war shall turn the trojans fly and conquer ilion burn so mars when human crimes for vengeance call shakes his huge javelin and whole army fall
he foams with wrath beneath his gloomy brow like fiery meteors his red eye balls glow the radiant helmet on his temple burns wave when he nods and lightens as he turns
not with more rage a conflagration rolls wraps the vast mountain and involves the poles for which_jove his splendour round the chief had thrown and cast the blaze of both the host on one
due to stern_hector pallas and pelides spear yet which_jove deferr the death he was to pay and gave what fate allow the honour of a day
now all on fire for fame his breast his eye burn at each foe and single every prize still at the closest rank the thickest fight he point his ardour and exerts his might
unhappy glory for his fate was near the grecian phalanx moveless as a tower on all side batter yet resists his power
by wind assail by billows beat in vain unmoved it hears above the tempest blow and sees the watery mountain break below
girt in surrounding flame he seems to fall like fire from which_jove and bursts upon them all bursts as a wave
that from the cloud impends and swell with tempests on the ship descends white are the decks with foam the wind aloud howl er the masts and sing through every shroud pale trembling tired the sailors freeze with fear and instant death on every wave appears
so some tall rock erhangs the hoary main so pale the greeks the eye of stern_hector meet the chief so thunder and so shakes the fleet
as when a lion rushing from his den amidst the plain of some wide water fen where numerous oxen as at ease they feed at large expatiate er the ranker mead
leaps on the herds before the herdsman eye the trembling herdsman far to distance fly some lordly bull the rest dispersed and fled
thus from the rage of which_jove like stern_hector flew all greece in heap but one he seized and slew mycenian periphes a mighty name
in wisdom great in arm well known to fame the minister of stern_hector eurystheus ire against alcides copreus was his sire
the son redeem the honour of the race a son as generous as the sire was base er all his country youth conspicuous far in every virtue or of peace or war
he singles out arrests and lays him dead but doom to stern_hector stronger force to yield against the margin of his ample shield he struck his hasty foot his heels up sprung
supine he fell his brazen helmet rung on the fallen chief the invading trojan press and plunged the pointed javelin in his breast
his circling friend who strove to guard too late the unhappy hero fled or shared his fate chased from the foremost line the grecian train now man the next receding toward the main
wedged in one body at the tent they stand wall round with sterns a gloomy desperate band now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight now fear itself confines them to the fight
man courage breathes in man but wise_nestor most the sage preserver of the grecian host exhorts adjures to guard these utmost shore and by their parent by themselves implores
oh friend be man your generous breast inflame with mutual honour and with mutual shame think of your hope your fortunes all the care your wife your infant and your parent share
think of each living father reverend head think of each ancestor with glory dead absent by me they speak by me
they sue they ask their safety and their fame from you the god their fate on this one action lay and all are lost if you desert the day
the mist of darkness which_jove around them threw she clear restoring all the war to view a sudden ray shot beaming er the plain and show the shore the navy and the main stern_hector they saw and all who fly or fight the scene wide opening to the blaze of light first of the field great
he spoke and round him breathed heroic fire minerva seconds what the sage inspires oilean_ajax strikes their eye his port majestic and his ample size a ponderous mace with studs of iron crown
full twenty cubits long he swings around nor fight like other fix to certain stands but looks a moving tower above the band high on the decks with vast gigantic stride the godlike hero stalks from side to side
so when a horseman from the watery mead skill in the manage of the bounding steed drives four fair courser practised to obey
to some great city through the public way safe in his art as side by side they run he shifts his seat and vaults from one to one and now to this and now to that he fly admiring number follow with their eye
as furious stern_hector thunder threats aloud and rush enraged before the trojan crowd then swift invades the ship whose beaky prores lay rank contiguous on the bending shore so the strong eagle from his airy height who marks the swans or cranes embodied flight stoops down impetuous while they light for food and stooping darkens with his wing the flood
from ship to ship thus oilean_ajax swiftly flew no less the wonder of the warring crew which_jove leads him on with his almighty hand and breathes fierce spirit in his following band
thou wouldst have thought so furious was their fire no force could tame them and no toil could tire as if new vigour from new fight they won and the long battle was but then begun
the warring nation meet the battle roars thick beats the combat on the sounding prores greece yet unconquer kept alive the war secure of death confiding in despair
the main bright with the blaze and red with hero slain like strength is felt from hope and from despair and each contends as his were all the war
troy in proud hope already view twas thou bold stern_hector whose resistless hand first seized a ship on that contested strand
the first that touch the unhappy trojan shore for this in arm the warring nation stood and bathed their generous breast with mutual blood
the same which dead protesilaus bore no room to poise the lance or bend the bow but hand to hand and man to man they grow
the falchions ring shield rattle axes sound sword flash in air or glitter on the ground with streaming blood the slippery shore are dyed and slaughter hero swell the dreadful tide
wounded they wound and seek each other heart with falchions axes sword and shorten dart still raging stern_hector with his ample hand grasps the high stern_hector and gives this loud command

this happy day with acclamations greet bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet the coward counsel of a timorous throng of reverend dotards check our glory long too long which_jove lull d

he spoke the warrior at his fierce command pour a new deluge on the grecian band even oilean_ajax paused so thick the javelin fly stepp back and doubted or to live or die
yet where the oars are placed he stands to wait what chief approaching dares attempt his fate even to the last his naval charge defends now shakes his spear now lifts and now protends even yet the greeks with piercing shouts inspires amidst attacks and death and dart and fire
friend hero name for ever dear once son of mars and thunderbolts of war ah yet be mindful of your old renown your great forefathers virtues and your own
what aid expect you in this utmost strait what bulwarks rising between you and fate no aid no bulwarks your retreat attend no friend to help no city to defend

castor and pollux book xvi the armour horse soldiers and officers are described achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend after which patroclus leads the myrmidons to battle
the trojans at the sight of patroclus in achilles armour taking him for that hero are cast into the uttermost consternation he beats them off from the vessel stern_hector himself fly sarpedon is killed though jupiter was averse to his fate
several other particulars of the battle are described in the heat of which patroclus neglecting the order of achilles pursues the foe to the wall of troy where apollo repulses and disarms him euphorbus wound him and stern_hector kills him which concludes the book
meantime patroclus to achilles fly the streaming tear fall copious from his eye not faster trickling to the plain below from the tall rock the sable water flow

yet scarce an army stirs him from his post danger on danger all around him glow and toil to toil and woe succeeds to woe

who midst surrounding frosts and vapours chill presid st on bleak dodona vocal hill whose groves the selli race austere surround hear as of old
lo to the danger of the fighting field the best the dearest of my friend i yield though still determined to my ship confined patroclus gone i stay but half behind
oh be his guard thy providential care confirm his heart and string his arm to war press by his single force let stern_hector see his fame in arm not owing all to me
but when the fleet are saved from foe and fire let him with conquest and renown retire preserve his arm preserve his social train and safe return him to these eye again
great which_jove consents to half the chief request but heaven eternal doom denies the rest to free the fleet was granted to his prayer his safe return the wind dispersed in air
thou gav st at thetis prayer glory to me and to the greeks despair back to his tent the stern_hector achilles fly and waits the combat with impatient eye
as wasps provoked by children in their play pour from their mansions by the broad highway in swarms the guiltless traveller engage whet all their stings and call forth all their rage
meanwhile the troop beneath patroclus care invade the trojans and commence the war all rise in arm and with a general cry
assert their waxen domes and buzzing progeny thus from the tent the fervent legion swarms so loud their clamours and so keen their arm
be mindful of your deed in ancient day your godlike master let your acts proclaim and add new glory to his mighty name
their rising rage patroclus breath inspires who thus inflames them with heroic fire warrior partners of achilles praise think your achilles sees you fight be brave and humble the proud monarch whom you save
joyful they heard and kindling as he spoke flew to the fleet involved in fire and smoke from shore to shore the doubling shouts resound the hollow ship return a deeper sound
the war stood still and all around them gazed when great achilles shining armour blazed troy saw and thought the dread achilles nigh at once they see they tremble and they fly
close to the stern_hector of that famed ship which bore unbless protesilaus to ilion shore the great paeonian bold pyrechmes stood who led his band from axius winding flood his shoulder blade receives the fatal wound the groaning warrior pants upon the ground
then first thy spear divine patroclus flew where the war raged and where the tumult grew his troop that see their country glory slain fly diverse scatter o er the distant plain
patroclus arm forbids the spreading fire and from the half burn ship proud troy retires clear from the smoke the joyful navy lies in heap on heap the foe tumultuous fly triumphant greece her rescued decks ascends and loud acclaim the starry region rends
so when thick cloud enwrap the mountain head er heaven expanse like one black ceiling spread sudden the thunderer with a flashing ray bursts through the darkness and lets down the day the hill shine out the rock in prospect rise and stream and vales and forests strike the eye the smiling scene wide opens to the sight and all the unmeasured ether flame with light
but troy repulsed and scatter o er the plain forced from the navy yet the fight maintains now every greek some hostile hero slew but still the foremost bold patroclus flew
sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound the brazen pointed spear with vigour thrown the thigh transfix and broke the brittle bone headlong he fell
as areilycus had turn him round next thoas was thy chance thy breast unarm received the spartan lance phylides dart as amphidus drew nigh
his blow prevented and transpierced his thigh tore all the brawn and rent the nerves away in darkness and in death the warrior lay
in equal arm two son of wise_nestor stand and two bold brother of the lycian band by great antilochus atymnius dies pierced in the flank lamented youth
he lies kind maris bleeding in his brother wound defends the breathless carcase on the ground furious he fly his murderer to engage
but godlike thrasimed prevents his rage between his arm and shoulder aims a blow his arm fall spouting on the dust below he sinks with endless darkness cover o er and vents his soul effused with gushing gore
slain by two brother thus two brother bleed sarpedon friend amisodarus seed amisodarus who by fury led the bane of man
abhorr chimaera bred skill in the dart in vain his son expire and pay the forfeit of their guilty sire stopp d
in the tumult cleobulus lies beneath oileus arm a living prize a living prize not long the trojan stood the thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood
amid the rank with mutual thirst of fame lycon the brave and fierce peneleus came in vain their javelin at each other flew now met in arm their eager sword they drew
plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies black death and fate unpitying seal his eye on the plumed crest of his boeotian foe
the daring lycon aim a noble blow the sword broke short but his peneleus sped full on the juncture of the neck and head
o ertaken neamas by merion bleeds pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steed back from the car he tumbles to the ground his swimming eye eternal shade surround
the head divided by a stroke so just hung by the skin the body sunk to dust next erymas was doom his fate to feel his open mouth received the cretan steel
beneath the brain the point a passage tore crash the thin bones and drown the teeth in gore his mouth his eye his nostrils pour a flood he sobs his soul out in the gush of blood
as when the flocks neglected by the swain or kids or lambs lie scatter o er the plain a troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey and rend the trembling unresisting prey
thus on the foe the greeks impetuous came troy fled unmindful of her former fame but still at stern_hector godlike oilean_ajax aim still pointed at his breast his javelin flamed
the trojan chief experienced in the field er his broad shoulder spread the massy shield observed the storm of dart the grecians pour
and on his buckler caught the ringing shower he sees for greece the scale of conquest rise yet stops and turns and saves his loved allies
as when the hand of which_jove a tempest form and rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storm dark er the field the ascending vapour fly and shade the sun and blots the golden sky so from the ship along the dusky plain dire flight and terror drove the trojan train
the fiery courser forced their lord away while far behind his trojans fall confused wedged in the trench in one vast carnage bruised chariot on chariot roll the clashing spokes shock while the madding steed break short their yokes
even stern_hector fled through head of disarray in vain they labour up the steepy mound their charioteers lie foaming on the ground
fierce on the rear with shouts patroclus fly tumultuous clamour fills the field and sky thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight cloud rise on cloud and heaven is snatch from sight
loud er the rout was heard the victor cry where the war bleeds and where the thickest die where horse and arm and chariot he erthrown and bleeding hero under axles groan
the affrighted steed their dying lord cast down scour er the field and stretch to reach the town no stop no check the steed of peleus knew from bank to bank the immortal courser flew
high bounding er the fosse the whirling car smokes through the rank ertakes the flying war and thunder after stern_hector stern_hector fly patroclus shakes his lance but fate denies
not with less noise with less impetuous force the tide of trojans urge their desperate course than when in autumn which_jove his fury pours and earth is loaden with incessant showers when guilty mortal break the eternal laws or judges bribed betray the righteous cause
from their deep bed he bids the rivers rise and opens all the flood gate of the sky the impetuous torrents from their hill obey whole field are drown and mountain swept away loud roars the deluge till it meets the main and trembling man sees all his labour vain
and now the chief the foremost troop repell back to the ship his destined progress held bore down half troy in his resistless way and forced the routed rank to stand the day
between the space where silver simois flows where lay the fleet and where the rampires rose all grim in dust and blood patroclus stands and turns the slaughter on the conquering band
thestor was next who saw the chief appear and fell the victim of his coward fear shrunk up he sat with wild and haggard eye nor stood to combat nor had force to fly
first pronous died beneath his fiery dart which pierced below the shield his valiant heart patroclus mark him as he shunn the war and with unmanly trembling shook the car and dropp the flowing rein
as on a rock that overhangs the main an angler studious of the line and cane some mighty fish draws panting to the shore not with less ease the barbed javelin bore the gaping dastard as the spear was shook he fell and life his heartless breast forsook
him twixt the jaws the javelin sticks and from the chariot draws next on eryalus he fly a stone large as a rock was by his fury thrown
full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew and burst the helm and cleft the head in two prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell and death involved him with the shade of hell
then low in dust epaltes echius lie ipheas evippus polymelus die amphoterus and erymas succeed and last tlepolemus and pyres bleed
where er he moves the growing slaughter spread in heap on heap a monument of dead when now sarpedon his brave friend beheld grovelling in dust and gasping on the field
with this reproach his flying host he warms oh stain to honour oh disgrace to arm forsake inglorious the contended plain this hand unaided shall the war sustain
the task be mine this hero strength to try who mows whole troop and makes an army fly he spake and speaking leaps from off the car patroclus light and sternly waits the war
as when two vultures on the mountain height stoop with resounding pinions to the fight they cuff they tear they raise a screaming cry
the desert echoes and the rock reply the warrior thus opposed in arm engage with equal clamours and with equal rage
which_jove view the combat whose event foreseen he thus bespoke his sister and his queen the hour draws on the destinies ordain
my godlike son shall press the phrygian plain already on the verge of death he stands his life is owed to fierce patroclus hand
say shall i snatch him from impending fate and send him safe to lycia distant far from all the danger and the toil of war or to his doom my bravest offspring yield and fatten with celestial blood the field
what passions in a parent breast debate then thus the goddess with the radiant eye what word are these sovereign of the sky
short is the date prescribed to mortal man shall which_jove for one extend the narrow span whose bounds were fix before his race began
how many son of god foredoom to death before proud ilion must resign their breath were thine exempt debate would rise above and murmuring power condemn their partial which_jove
give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight and when the ascending soul has wing her flight let sleep and death convey by thy command
his friend and people to his future praise a marble tomb and pyramid shall raise and lasting honour to his ashes give his fame tis all the dead can have shall live
the breathless body to his native land she said the cloud compeller overcome assents to fate and ratifies the doom then touch with grief the weeping heaven distill d
the god his eye averting from the plain laments his son predestined to be slain far from the lycian shore his happy native reign
now met in arm the combatants appear each heaved the shield and poised the lifted spear from strong patroclus hand the javelin fled and pass the groin of valiant thrasymed the nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain he fall and falling bites the bloody plain
the first aloof with erring fury flew the next transpierced achilles mortal steed the generous pedasus of theban breed fix in the shoulder joint he reel around roll in the bloody dust and paw the slippery ground
his sudden fall the entangled harness broke each axle crackled and the chariot shook when bold automedon to disengage the starting courser and restrain their rage divides the traces with his sword and freed the encumbered chariot from the dying steed the rest move on obedient to the rein the car rolls slowly er the dusty plain
the towering chief to fiercer fight advance and first sarpedon whirl his weighty lance which er the warrior shoulder took its course and spent in empty air its dying force
a shower of blood er all the fatal field two sounding dart the lycian leader threw not so patroclus never erring dart aim d
at his breast it pierced a mortal part where the strong fibres bind the solid heart then as the mountain oak or poplar tall or pine fit mast for some great admiral
nods to the axe till with a groaning sound it sinks and spreads its honour on the ground thus fell the king and laid on earth supine
before his chariot stretch his form divine he grasp the dust distain with streaming gore and pale in death lay groaning on the shore
so lies a bull beneath the lion paws while the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws the trembling limb and sucks the smoking blood deep groans and hollow roars rebellow through the wood
the dying chief address his last command glaucus be bold thy task be first to dare the glorious danger of destructive war to lead my troop to combat at their head incite the living and supply the dead
then to the leader of the lycian band tell them i charged them with my latest breath not unrevenged to bear sarpedon death
then as a friend and as a warrior fight defend my body conquer in my right that taught by great examples all may try like thee to vanquish or like me to die
what grief what shame must glaucus undergo if these spoil arm adorn a grecian foe he ceased the fate suppress d
the prostrate prince and on his bosom trod then drew the weapon from his panting heart the reeking fibres clinging to the dart from the wide wound gush out a stream of blood and the soul issued in the purple flood
his labouring breath and his eye darken with the shade of death the insulting victor with disdain bestrode his flying steed the myrmidons detain unguided now their mighty master slain
his painful arm yet useless with the smart inflicted late by teucer deadly dart supported on his better hand he stay
he pray all seeing monarch whether lycia coast or sacred ilion thy bright presence boast powerful alike to ease the wretch smart
all impotent of aid transfix with grief unhappy glaucus heard the dying chief to phoebus then twas all he could hear me
that thrills my arm and shoots through every vein i stand unable to sustain the spear and sigh at distance from the glorious war
god of every healing art lo stiff with clotted blood and pierced with pain low in the dust is great sarpedon laid nor which_jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid
but thou god of health thy succour lend to guard the relics of my slaughter friend for thou though distant canst restore my might to head my lycians and support the fight
apollo heard and suppliant as he stood his heavenly hand restrain the flux of blood he drew the dolours from the wounded part and breathed a spirit in his rising heart
first to the fight his native troop he warms then loudly calls on troy vindictive arm with ample strides he stalks from place to place
renew by art divine the hero stands and owns the assistance of immortal hand now fire agenor now polydamas ćneas next and stern_hector he accosts inflaming thus the rage of all their host
what thought regardless chief thy breast employ oh too forgetful of the friend of troy those generous friend who from their country far breathe their brave soul out in another war
in action valiant and in council wise_nestor who guarded right and kept his people free to all his lycians lost and lost to thee
see where in dust the great sarpedon lies stretch by patroclus arm on yonder plain save from hostile rage his loved remains
ah let not greece his conquer trophies boast nor on his corse revenge her hero lost he spoke each leader in his grief partook troy at the loss through all her legions shook
at once his country pillar and their own a chief who led to troy beleaguer wall a host of hero and outshined them all
transfix with deep regret they view erthrown fired they rush on first stern_hector seeks the foe and with superior vengeance greatly glows
but er the dead the fierce patroclus stands and rousing oilean_ajax roused the listening band hero be man be what you were before or weigh the great occasion and be more
the chief who taught our lofty wall to yield lies pale in death extended on the field to guard his body troy in number fly tis half the glory to maintain our prize
the hero kindle at his fierce command the martial squadrons close on either hand here troy and lycia charge with loud alarm thessalia there and greece oppose their arm
haste strip his arm the slaughter round him spread and send the living lycians to the dead with horrid shouts they circle round the slain the clash of armour rings er all the plain
great which_jove to swell the horror of the fight er the fierce army pours pernicious night and round his son confounds the warring host his fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts
now greece gives way and great epigeus fall agacleus son from budium lofty wall who chased for murder thence a suppliant came to peleus and the silver footed dame now sent to troy achilles arm to aid he pays due vengeance to his kinsman shade
soon as his luckless hand had touch the dead a rock large fragment thunder on his head hurl by hectorean force it cleft in twain
his shatter helm and stretch him er the slain fierce to the van of fight patroclus came and like an eagle darting at his game
what grief thy heart what fury urged thy hand generous greek when with full vigour thrown at sthenelaus flew the weighty stone which sunk him to the dead when troy too near that arm drew back and stern_hector learn to fear
far as an able hand a lance can throw or at the lists or at the fighting foe so far the trojans from their line retired till glaucus turning all the rest inspired
sprung on the trojan and the lycian band then bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage the only hope of chalcon trembling age wide er the land was stretch d
his large domain with stately seat and riches blest in vain him bold with youth and eager to pursue the flying lycians glaucus met and slew
the achaians sorrow for their hero slain with conquering shouts the trojans shake the plain and crowd to spoil the dead the greeks oppose an iron circle round the carcase grows
pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound he fell and falling made the field resound then brave laogonus resign his breath despatch by merion to the shade of death
on ida holy hill he made abode the priest of which_jove and honour like his god between the jaw and ear the javelin went
who stooping forward from the death withdrew the lance hiss harmless er his covering shield and trembling struck and rooted in the field there yet scarce spent it quivers on the plain sent by the great aeneas arm in vain
the soul exhaling issued at the vent his spear aeneas at the victor threw swift as thou art the raging hero cry
and skill in dancing to dispute the prize my spear the destined passage had it found had fix thy active vigour to the ground
valiant leader of the dardan host insulted merion thus retorts the boast strong as you are tis mortal force you trust an arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust
and if to this my lance thy fate be given vain are thy vaunts success is still from heaven this instant sends thee down to pluto coast mine is the glory his thy parting ghost
with word to combat ill befits the brave not empty boasts the son of troy repel your sword must plunge them to the shade of hell
friend menoetius son this answer gave to speak beseems the council but to dare in glorious action is the task of war
this said patroclus to the battle fly great merion follows and new shouts arise shield helmet rattle as the warrior close and thick and heavy sound the storm of blow
as through the shrilling vale or mountain ground the labour of the woodman axe resound blow following blow are heard re echoing wide while crackling forests fall on every side thus echoed all the field with loud alarm so fell the warrior and so rung their arm
now great sarpedon on the sandy shore his heavenly form defaced with dust and gore and stuck with dart by warring hero shed lies undistinguish from the vulgar dead
his long disputed corse the chief enclose on every side the busy combat grows thick as beneath some shepherd thatch abode the pails high foaming with a milky flood
the buzzing fly a persevering train incessant swarm and chased return again which_jove view the combat with a stern_hector survey and eye that flash intolerable day
his breast debates the vengeance due and meditates the fate whether to urge their prompt effect and call the force of stern_hector to patroclus fall this instant see his short lived trophies won and stretch him breathless on his slaughter son or yet with many a soul untimely flight augment the fame and horror of the fight
fix on the field his sight to crown achilles valiant friend with praise at length he dooms and that his last of day shall set in glory bids him drive the foe
then stern_hector mind he fills with dire dismay he mounts his car and calls his host away sunk with troy heavy fate he sees decline the scales of which_jove and pants with awe divine
then nor before the hardy lycians fled and left their monarch with the common dead around in heap on heap a dreadful wall of carnage rises as the hero fall
nor unattended see the shade below so which_jove decreed at length the greeks obtain the prize contested and despoil the slain
the radiant arm are by patroclus borne patroclus ship the glorious spoil adorn then thus to phoebus in the realm above spoke from his throne the cloud compelling which_jove
on the phrygian plain and from the fight convey sarpedon slain then bathe his body in the crystal flood with dust dishonour and deform with blood er all his limb ambrosial odours shed and with celestial robes adorn the dead
they to his friend the immortal charge shall bear his friend a tomb and pyramid shall rear what honour mortal after death receive those unavailing honour we may give
descend my phoebus those rite discharged his sacred corse bequeath to the soft arm of silent sleep and death illustration sleep and death conveying the body of sarpedon to lycia
apollo bow and from mount ida height swift to the field precipitates his flight thence from the war the breathless hero bore veil in a cloud to silver simois shore there bathed his honourable wound and dress his manly members in the immortal vest and with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews restores his freshness and his form renews
then sleep and death two twins of winged race of matchless swiftness but of silent pace received sarpedon at the god command
and in a moment reach the lycian land the corse amidst his weeping friend they laid where endless honour wait the sacred shade
sleep and death conveying the body of sarpedon to lycia meanwhile patroclus pours along the plain with foaming courser and with loosen rein
fierce on the trojan and the lycian crew ah blind to fate thy headlong fury flew against what fate and powerful which_jove ordain
for he the god whose counsel uncontroll dismay the mighty and confound the bold the god who gives resumes and order all he urged thee on and urged thee on to fall
who last beneath thy vengeance press the plain when heaven itself thy fatal fury led and call to fill the number of the dead
vain was thy friend command thy courage vain who first brave hero by that arm was slain adrestus first autonous then succeeds echeclus follows next young megas bleeds epistor melanippus bite the ground
now troy had stoop beneath his matchless power but flaming phoebus kept the sacred tower thrice at the battlements patroclus strook
his blazing aegis thrice apollo shook he tried the fourth when bursting from the cloud a more than mortal voice was heard aloud
the slaughter elasus and mulius crown then sunk pylartes to eternal night the rest dispersing trust their fate to flight
patroclus cease this heaven defended wall defies thy lance not fated yet to fall thy friend thy greater far it shall withstand
troy shall not stoop even to achilles hand so spoke the god who dart celestial fire the greek obeys him and with awe retires
while stern_hector checking at the scaean gate his panting courser in his breast debates or in the field his force to employ or draw the troop within the wall of troy
thus while he thought beside him phoebus stood in asius shape who reigned by sangar flood thy brother hecuba from dymas sprung a valiant warrior haughty bold and young
thus he accosts him what a shameful sight god is it stern_hector that forbears the fight were thine my vigour
this successful spear should soon convince thee of so false a fear turn thee ah turn thee to the field of fame and in patroclus blood efface thy shame
perhaps apollo shall thy arm succeed and heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed so spoke the inspiring god then took his flight and plunged amidst the tumult of the fight
he bids cebrion drive the rapid car the lash resounds the courser rush to war the god the grecians sinking soul depress and pour swift spirit through each trojan breast
patroclus light impatient for the fight a spear his left a stone employs his right with all his nerves he drives it at the foe
pointed above and rough and gross below the falling ruin crush cebrion head the lawless offspring of king priam bed his front brows eye one undistinguish wound
the bursting balls drop sightless to the ground the charioteer while yet he held the rein struck from the car fall headlong on the plain
to the dark shade the soul unwilling glides while the proud victor thus his fall derides good heaven what active feats yon artist shows
what skilful divers are our phrygian foe mark with what ease they sink into the sand pity that all their practice is by land
then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize to spoil the carcase fierce patroclus fly swift as a lion terrible and bold
that sweeps the field depopulates the fold pierced through the dauntless heart then tumbles slain and from his fatal courage finds his bane
thus for some slaughter hind with equal rage two lordly rulers of the wood engage stung with fierce hunger each the prey invades and echoing roars rebellow through the shade
stern_hector fastens on the warrior head and by the foot patroclus drags the dead while all around confusion rage and fright mix the contending host in mortal fight
at once bold stern_hector leaping from his car defends the body and provokes the war so pent by hill the wild wind roar aloud
in the deep bosom of some gloomy wood leaves arm and trees aloft in air are blown the broad oaks crackle and the sylvans groan this way and that the rattling thicket bends and the whole forest in one crash descends
on dart now round the carcase ring now flight of arrow bounding from the string stone follow stone some clatter on the field some hard and heavy shake the sounding shield
not with less noise with less tumultuous rage in dreadful shock the mingled host engage dart shower but where the rising whirlwind cloud the plain sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains and
now flaming from the zenith sol had driven his fervid orb through half the vault of heaven while on each host with equal tempests fell the showering dart and number sank to hell
stretch in death forgets the guiding rein but when his evening wheels erhung the main glad conquest rested on the grecian train
then from amidst the tumult and alarm they draw the conquer corse and radiant arm then rash patroclus with new fury glows and breathing slaughter pours amid the foe
thrice on the press like mars himself he flew and thrice three hero at each onset slew there ends thy glory
there the fate untwine the last black remnant of so bright a line apollo dreadful stops thy middle way death calls and heaven allows no longer day
for lo the god in dusky cloud enshrined approaching dealt a staggering blow behind the weighty shock his neck and shoulder feel his eye flash sparkles his stunn sense reel
in giddy darkness far to distance flung his bounding helmet on the champaign rung achilles plume is stain with dust and gore
that plume which never stoop to earth before long used untouch in fighting field to shine and shade the temples of the mad divine
which_jove dooms it now on stern_hector helm to nod not long for fate pursues him and the god his spear in shivers fall his ample shield drops from his arm his baldric strows the field
loose is each joint each nerve with horror shakes stupid he stares and all assistless stands such is the force of more than mortal hand
the corslet his astonish breast forsakes a dardan youth there was well known to fame from panthus sprung euphorbus was his name
famed for the manage of the foaming horse skill in the dart and matchless in the course full twenty knights he tumbled from the car
while yet he learn his rudiments of war his venturous spear first drew the hero gore he struck he wounded but he durst no more
nor though disarm patroclus fury stood but swift withdrew the long protended wood and turn him short and herded in the crowd
thus by an arm divine and mortal spear wounded at once patroclus yields to fear retires for succour to his social train and fly the fate which heaven decreed in vain
stern_hector as the bleeding chief he view breaks through the rank and his retreat pursues the lance arrests him with a mortal wound he fall earth thunder and his arm resound
so scorch with heat along the desert score the roaming lion meets a bristly boar fast by the spring they both dispute the flood with flaming eye and jaws besmear with blood at length the sovereign savage wins the strife and the torn boar resigns his thirst and life
with him all greece was sunk that moment all her yet surviving hero seem to fall patroclus thus so many chief erthrown so many life effused expires his own
as dying now at stern_hector foot he lies he sternly view him and triumphant cry lie there patroclus and with thee the joy thy pride once promised of subverting troy the fancied scene of ilion wrapt in flame and thy soft pleasures served with captive dame
unthinking man i fought those tower to free and guard that beauteous race from lord like thee but thou a prey to vultures shalt be made thy own achilles cannot lend thee aid
though much at parting that great chief might say and much enjoin thee this important day return not my brave friend perhaps he said without the bloody arm of stern_hector dead
he spoke patroclus march and thus he sped supine and wildly gazing on the sky with faint expiring breath the chief replies vain boaster
cease and know the power divine which_jove and apollo is this deed not thine to heaven is owed whate er your own you call and
heaven itself disarm me ere my fall had twenty mortal each thy match in might opposed me fairly they had sunk in fight
by fate and phoebus was i first erthrown euphorbus next the third mean part thy own but thou imperious hear my latest breath
insulting man thou shalt be soon as i black fate erhangs thee and thy hour draws nigh even now on life last verge i see thee stand i see thee fall and by achilles hand
the god inspire it and it sound thy death he faints the soul unwilling wing her way the beauteous body left a load of clay
then stern_hector pausing as his eye he fed on the pale carcase thus address the dead from whence this boding speech the stern_hector decree of death denounced or why denounced to me
flits to the lone uncomfortable coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost why not as well achilles fate be given to stern_hector lance
pensive he said then pressing as he lay his breathless bosom tore the lance away and upwards cast the corse the reeking spear he shakes and charges the bold charioteer
but swift automedon with loosen rein rapt in the chariot er the distant plain far from his rage the immortal courser drove the immortal courser were the gift of which_jove
who knows the will of heaven illustration ćsculapius ćsculapius book xvii argument the seventh battle for the body of patroclus the acts of great_menelaus
great_menelaus upon the death of patroclus defends his body from the enemy euphorbus who attempts it is slain stern_hector advancing great_menelaus retires but soon return with oilean_ajax and drives him off
this glaucus objects to stern_hector as a flight who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from patroclus and renews the battle
the greeks give way till oilean_ajax rallies them aeneas sustains the trojans aeneas and stern_hector attempt the chariot of achilles which is borne off by automedon
the horse of achilles deplore the loss of patroclus jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness the noble prayer of oilean_ajax on that occasion
great_menelaus sends antilochus to achilles with the news of patroclus death then return to the fight where though attacked with the utmost fury he and meriones assisted by the ajaces bear off the body to the ship
the time is the evening of the eight and twentieth day the scene lies in the field before troy on the cold earth divine patroclus spread
lies pierced with wound among the vulgar dead great_menelaus touch with generous woe spring to the front and guards him from the foe
thus round her new fallen young the heifer moves fruit of her throes and first born of her love and anxious helpless as he lies and bare
turns and re turns her with a mother care opposed to each that near the carcase came his broad shield glimmers and his lance flame
the son of panthus skill the dart to send eye the dead hero and insults the friend this hand atrides laid patroclus low warrior desist nor tempt an equal blow
to me the spoil my prowess won resign depart with life and leave the glory mine the trojan thus the spartan monarch burn d
with generous anguish and in scorn return laugh st thou not which_jove from thy superior throne when mortal boast of prowess not their own
not thus the lion glory in his might nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight nor thus the boar those terror of the plain man only vaunts his force and vaunts in vain
but far the vainest of the boastful kind these son of panthus vent their haughty mind yet twas but late beneath my conquering steel
this boaster brother hyperenor fell against our arm which rashly he defied vain was his vigour and as vain his pride
these eye beheld him on the dust expire no more to cheer his spouse or glad his sire presumptuous youth like his shall be thy doom go wait thy brother to the stygian gloom
or while thou may st avoid the threaten fate fools stay to feel it and are wise_nestor too late unmoved euphorbus thus that action known come for my brother blood repay thy own
his weeping father claims thy destined head and spouse a widow in her bridal bed on these thy conquer spoil i shall bestow
to soothe a consort and a parent woe no longer then defer the glorious strife let heaven decide our fortune fame and life
swift as the word the missile lance he flings the well aim weapon on the buckler rings but blunted by the brass innoxious fall
great atrides calls nor fly the javelin from his arm in vain it pierced his throat and bent him to the plain wide through the neck appears the grisly wound prone sinks the warrior and his arm resound
the shining circlets of his golden hair which even the grace might be proud to wear instarr with gems and gold bestrow the shore with dust dishonour and deform with gore
as the young olive in some sylvan scene crown by fresh fountains with eternal green lifts the gay head in snowy flowerets fair and plays and dances to the gentle air
a whirlwind from high heaven invades the tender plant and withers all its shade it lies uprooted from its genial bed a lovely ruin now defaced and dead thus young thus beautiful euphorbus lay while the fierce spartan tore his arm away
on which_jove the father when lo proud of his deed and glorious in the prize affrighted troy the towering victor fly
fly as before some mountain lion ire the village curs and trembling swains retire when er the slaughter bull they hear him roar and see his jaws distil with smoking gore all pale with fear at distance scatter round
and urged great stern_hector to dispute the prize in mentes shape beneath whose martial care the rough ciconians learn the trade of war
forbear he cried with fruitless speed to chase achilles courser of ethereal race they stoop not these to mortal man command or stoop to none but great achilles hand
too long amused with a pursuit so vain turn and behold the brave euphorbus slain by sparta slain for ever now
they shout incessant and the vales resound meanwhile apollo view with envious eye suppress the fire which burn in that undaunted breast
thus having spoke apollo wing his flight and mix with mortal in the toil of fight his word infix unutterable care
deep in great stern_hector soul through all the war he dart his anxious eye and instant view the breathless hero in his blood imbued forth welling from the wound as prone he lay
and in the victor hand the shining prey sheath in bright arm through cleaving rank he fly and sends his voice in thunder to the sky
fierce as a flood of flame by vulcan sent it flew and fired the nation as it went atrides from the voice the storm divined and thus explored his own unconquer mind
then shall i quit patroclus on the plain slain in my cause and for my honour slain desert the arm the relics of my friend
or singly stern_hector and his troop attend sure where such partial favour heaven bestow to brave the hero were to brave the god
forgive me greece if once i quit the field tis not to stern_hector but to heaven i yield yet nor the god nor heaven should give me fear
the voice of oilean_ajax reach my ear still would we turn still battle on the plain and give achilles all that yet remains of his and our patroclus
did but this no more the time allow troy thicken on the shore a sable scene the terror stern_hector led
so from the fold the unwilling lion part forced by loud clamours and a storm of dart he fly indeed but threatens as he fly with heart indignant and retorted eye
now enter in the spartan rank he turn his manly breast and with new fury burn o er all the black battalions sent his view and through the cloud the godlike oilean_ajax knew where labouring on the left the warrior stood
all grim in arm and cover o er with blood there breathing courage where the god of day had sunk each heart with terror and dismay
slow he recedes and sighing quits the dead to him the king oh oilean_ajax oh my friend haste and patroclus loved remains defend
the body to achilles to restore demands our care alas we can no more for naked now despoiled of arm he lies
and stern_hector glory in the dazzling prize he said and touch his heart the raging pair pierced the thick battle and provoke the war
already had stern_hector seized his head and doom to trojan god the unhappy dead but soon as oilean_ajax rear his tower like shield sprung to his car and measured back the field his train to troy the radiant armour bear to stand a trophy of his fame in war
meanwhile great oilean_ajax his broad shield display guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade and now before and now behind he stood
thus in the centre of some gloomy wood with many a step the lioness surrounds her tawny young beset by man and hounds elate her heart and rousing all her power dark er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours
but glaucus leader of the lycian aid on stern_hector frowning thus his flight upbraids where now in stern_hector shall we stern_hector find
fast by his side the generous spartan glows with great revenge and feeds his inward woe a manly form without a manly mind
since battle is renounced thy thought employ what other methods may preserve thy troy tis time to try if ilion state can stand by thee alone nor ask a foreign hand
is this chief a hero boasted fame how vain without the merit is the name mean empty boast but shall the lycians stake their life for you
those lycians you forsake what from thy thankless arm can we expect thy friend sarpedon proves thy base neglect say shall our slaughter body guard your wall
while unreveng the great sarpedon fall even where he died for troy you left him there a feast for dog and all the fowls of air
did such a spirit as the god impart impel one trojan hand or trojan heart such as should burn in every soul that draws the sword for glory and his country cause
on my command if any lycian wait hence let him march and give up troy to fate even yet our mutual arm we might employ and drag yon carcase to the wall of troy
oh were patroclus ours we might obtain sarpedon arm and honour corse again greece with achilles friend should be repaid and thus due honour purchased to his shade
but word are vain let oilean_ajax once appear and stern_hector trembles and recedes with fear thou dar st not meet the terror of his eye
the trojan chief with fix resentment eyed the lycian leader and sedate replied say is it just my friend that stern_hector ear from such a warrior such a speech should hear
and lo already thou prepar st to fly i deem thee once the wisest of thy kind but ill this insult suits a prudent mind
i shun great oilean_ajax i desert my train tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain i joy to mingle where the battle bleeds and hear the thunder of the sounding steed
but which_jove high will is ever uncontroll the strong he withers and confounds the bold now crowns with fame the mighty man and now strikes the fresh garland from the victor brow
come through yon squadrons let us hew the way and thou be witness if i fear to day if yet a greek the sight of stern_hector dread or yet their hero dare defend the dead
then turning to the martial host he cry ye trojans dardans lycians and allies be man my friend in action as in name and yet be mindful of your ancient fame
stern_hector in proud achilles arm shall shine torn from his friend by right of conquest mine he strode along the field as thus he said the sable plumage nodded er his head
swift through the spacious plain he sent a look one instant saw one instant overtook the distant band that on the sandy shore the radiant spoil to sacred ilion bore
there his own mail unbraced the field bestrow his train to troy convey the massy load now blazing in the immortal arm he stands
the work and present of celestial hand by aged peleus to achilles given as first to peleus by the court of heaven his father arm not long achilles wears forbid by fate to reach his father year
him proud in triumph glittering from afar the god whose thunder rends the troubled air beheld with pity as apart he sat
and conscious look through all the scene of fate he shook the sacred honour of his head olympus trembled and the godhead said
in heavenly panoply divinely bright thou stand st and army tremble at thy sight as at achilles self beneath thy dart lies slain the great achilles dearer part
ah wretched man unmindful of thy end a moment glory and what fate attend thou from the mighty dead those arm hast torn which once the greatest of mankind had worn
no more andromache shall come with joyful tear to welcome stern_hector home no more officious with endearing charm from thy tired limb unbrace pelides arm
yet live i give thee one illustrious day a blaze of glory ere thou fad st away for ah then with his sable brow he gave the nod that seals his word the sanction of the god
fill with the god enlarged his members grew through all his veins a sudden vigour flew the blood in brisker tide began to roll and mars himself came rushing on his soul
the stubborn arm by which_jove command disposed conform spontaneous and around him closed exhorting loud through all the field he strode and look and moved achilles or a god
now mesthles glaucus medon he inspires now phorcys chromius and hippothous fire the great thersilochus like fury found asteropaeus kindled at the sound and ennomus in augury renown
hear all ye host and hear unnumber band of neighbouring nation or of distant land twas not for state we summon you so far
to boast our number and the pomp of war ye came to fight a valiant foe to chase to save our present and our future race
tor this our wealth our products you enjoy and glean the relics of exhausted troy now then to conquer or to die prepare to die or conquer are the terms of war
whatever hand shall win patroclus slain whoe er shall drag him to the trojan train with stern_hector self shall equal honour claim with stern_hector part the spoil and share the fame
fired by his word the troop dismiss their fear they join they thicken they protend their spear full on the greeks they drive in firm array and each from oilean_ajax hope the glorious prey
vain hope what number shall the field erspread what victim perish round the mighty dead great oilean_ajax mark the growing storm from far and thus bespoke his brother of the war
our fatal day alas is come my friend and all our war and glory at an end tis not this corse alone
we guard in vain condemn to vultures on the trojan plain we too must yield the same sad fate must fall on thee on me perhaps my friend on all
see what a tempest direful stern_hector spreads and lo it bursts it thunder on our head call on our greeks if any hear the call
the bravest greeks this hour demands them all the warrior raised his voice and wide around the field re echoed the distressful sound
chief prince to whose hand is given the rule of man whose glory is from heaven whom with due honour both atrides grace
all whom this well known voice shall reach from far all whom i see not through this cloud of war come all
ye guides and guardians of our argive race let generous rage your arm employ and save patroclus from the dog of troy
oilean_ajax first the voice obey swift was his pace and ready was his aid next him idomeneus more slow with age and
merion burning with a hero rage the long succeeding number who can name but all were greeks and eager all for fame
fierce to the charge great stern_hector led the throng whole troy embodied rush with shouts along thus when a mountain billow foams and raves where some swoln river disembogues his wave
full in the mouth is stopp the rushing tide the boiling ocean work from side to side the river trembles to his utmost shore and distant rock re bellow to the roar
which_jove pouring darkness er the mingled fight conceals the warrior shining helms in night to him the chief for whom the host contend had lived not hateful for he lived a friend
nor less resolved the firm achaian band with brazen shield in horrid circle stand dead he protects him with superior care
nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air illustration fight for the body of patroclus fight for the body of patroclus
the first attack the grecians scarce sustain repulsed they yield the trojans seize the slain then fierce they rally to revenge led on by the swift rage of oilean_ajax ajax_telamon
with headlong force the foremost rank he tore so through the thicket bursts the mountain boar and rudely scatters for a distance round the frighted hunter and the baying hound
the son of lethus brave pelasgus heir hippothous dragg the carcase through the war the sinewy ankles bored the foot he bound with thongs inserted through the double wound inevitable fate ertakes the deed doom by great oilean_ajax vengeful lance to bleed it cleft the helmet brazen cheeks in twain the shatter crest and horse hair strow the plain
with nerves relax he tumbles to the ground the brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound he drops patroclus foot and er him spread now lies a sad companion of the dead far from larissa lies his native air and ill requites his parent tender care
oilean_ajax to peleus son the second name in graceful stature next and next in fame lamented youth in life first bloom he fell sent by great oilean_ajax to the shade of hell
once more at oilean_ajax stern_hector javelin fly the grecian marking as it cut the sky shunn the descending death which hissing on stretch in the dust
the boldest warrior and the noblest mind in little panope for strength renown he held his seat and ruled the realm around
plunged in his throat the weapon drank his blood and deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood in clanging arm the hero fell and all the field resounded with his weighty fall
the telamonian lance his belly rends the hollow armour burst before the stroke and through the wound the rushing entrails broke
the great iphytus son schedius the brave of all the phocian kind phorcys as slain hippothous he defends in strong convulsions panting on the sands he lies and grasps the dust with dying hand
struck at the sight recede the trojan train the shouting argives strip the hero slain and now had troy by greece compell to yield
fled to her ramparts and resign the field greece in her native fortitude elate with which_jove averse had turn the scale of fate
but phoebus urged ćneas to the fight he seem like aged periphas to sight a herald in anchises love grown old revered for prudence and with prudence bold
there have been hero who by virtuous care by valour number and by art of war have forced the power to spare a sinking state and gain at length the glorious odds of fate
but you when fortune smiles when which_jove declares his partial favour and assists your war your shameful efforts gainst yourselves employ and force the unwilling god to ruin troy
thus he what methods yet chief remain to save your troy though heaven its fall ordain ćneas through the form assumed descries the power conceal and thus to stern_hector cry oh lasting shame
to our own fear a prey we seek our ramparts and desert the day a god nor is he less my bosom warms and tells me which_jove asserts the trojan arm
he spoke and foremost to the combat flew the bold example all his host pursue then first leocritus beneath him bled
in vain beloved by valiant lycomede who view his fall and grieving at the chance swift to revenge it sent his angry lance the whirling lance with vigorous force address descends and pants in apisaon breast from rich paeonia vales the warrior came
asteropeus with grief beheld the slain and rush to combat but he rush in vain indissolubly firm around the dead rank within rank on buckler buckler spread and hemm with bristled spear the grecians stood
next thee asteropeus in place and fame a brazen bulwark and an iron wood great oilean_ajax eye them with incessant care
and stands the centre and the soul of all fix on the spot they war and wounded wound a sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground on heap the greeks on heap the trojans bled and thickening round them rise the hill of dead
greece in close order and collected might yet suffers least and sways the wavering fight fierce as conflicting fire the combat burns and now it rises now it sinks by turns
in one thick darkness all the fight was lost the sun the moon and all the ethereal host seem as extinct day ravish from their eye and all heaven splendours blotted from the sky
and in an orb contracts the crowded war close in their rank command to fight or fall such er patroclus body hung the night
no vapour rested on the mountain head the golden sun pour forth a stronger ray and all the broad expansion flamed with day
the rest in sunshine fought and open light unclouded there the aerial azure spread dispersed around the plain by fits they fight
and here and there their scatter arrow light but death and darkness er the carcase spread there burn the war and there the mighty bled
meanwhile the son of wise_nestor in the rear their fellows routed toss the distant spear and skirmish wide so wise_nestor gave command when from the ship he sent the pylian band
the youthful brother thus for fame contend nor knew the fortune of achilles friend in thought they view him still with martial joy glorious in arm and dealing death to troy
but round the corse the hero pant for breath and thick and heavy grows the work of death erlabour now with dust and sweat and gore their knees their legs their foot are covered er drops follow drops the cloud on cloud arise and carnage clogs their hand and darkness fills their eye
as when a slaughter bull yet reeking hide strain with full force and tugg from side to side the brawny curriers stretch and labour er
the extended surface drunk with fat and gore so tugging round the corse both army stood the mangled body bathed in sweat and blood while greeks and ilians equal strength employ now to the ship to force it now to troy
not pallas self her breast when fury warms nor he whose anger sets the world in arm could blame this scene such rage such horror reign such which_jove to honour the great dead ordain
achilles in his ship at distance lay nor knew the fatal fortune of the day he yet unconscious of patroclus fall in dust extended under ilion wall expects him glorious from the conquered plain and for his wish return prepares in vain though well he knew to make proud ilion bend was more than heaven had destined to his friend
perhaps to him this thetis had reveal the rest in pity to her son conceal still raged the conflict round the hero dead and heap on heap by mutual wound they bled
cursed be the man even private greeks would say who dares desert this well disputed day first may the cleaving earth before our eye gape wide and drink our blood for sacrifice first perish all ere
haughty troy shall boast we lost patroclus and our glory lost thus they while with one voice the trojans said grant this day which_jove or heap us on the dead
meantime at distance from the scene of blood the pensive steed of great achilles stood their godlike master slain before their eye they wept and shared in human miseries
in vain automedon now shakes the rein now plies the lash and soothes and threats in vain nor to the fight nor hellespont they go
restive they stood and obstinate in woe still as a tombstone never to be moved on some good man or woman unreproved lays its eternal weight or fix as stands a marble courser by the sculptor hand placed on the hero grave
then clash their sounding arm the clangours rise and shake the brazen concave of the sky along their face the big round drops coursed down with silent pace conglobing on the dust
their manes that late circled their arched necks and waved in state trail on the dust beneath the yoke were spread and prone to earth was hung their languid head nor which_jove disdain to cast a pitying look
while thus relenting to the steed he spoke unhappy courser of immortal strain exempt from age and deathless now in vain
what is there of inferior birth that breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth what wretched creature of what wretched kind than man more weak calamitous and blind
did we your race on mortal man bestow only alas to share in mortal woe for ah a miserable race but cease to mourn
for not by you shall priam son be borne high on the splendid car one glorious prize he rashly boasts the rest our will denies
ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart ourself with rising spirit swell your heart automedon your rapid flight shall bear safe to the navy through the storm of war
for yet tis given to troy to ravage er the field and spread her slaughter to the shore the sun shall see her conquer till his fall with sacred darkness shade the face of all
he said and breathing in the immortal horse excessive spirit urged them to the course from their high manes they shake the dust and bear the kindling chariot through the parted war so fly a vulture through the clamorous train of geese that scream and scatter round the plain
from danger now with swiftest speed they flew and now to conquest with like speed pursue sole in the seat the charioteer remains now plies the javelin now directs the rein
him brave alcimedon beheld distress approach the chariot and the chief address what god provokes thee rashly thus to dare alone unaided in the thickest war
alas thy friend is slain and stern_hector wields achilles arm triumphant in the field in happy time the charioteer replies
the bold alcimedon now greets my eye no greek like him the heavenly steed restrains or holds their fury in suspended rein
patroclus while he lived their rage could tame but now patroclus is an empty name to thee i yield the seat to thee resign
the ruling charge the task of fight be mine he said alcimedon with active heat snatches the rein and vaults into the seat
his friend descends the chief of troy descried and call ćneas fighting near his side lo to my sight beyond our hope restored achilles car deserted of its lord
the glorious steed our ready arm invite scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight can such opponents stand when we assail
the son of venus to the counsel yields then er their backs they spread their solid shield with brass refulgent the broad surface shined and thick bull hides the spacious concave lined
them chromius follows aretus succeeds each hope the conquest of the lofty steed in vain brave youth with glorious hope ye burn in vain advance
unite thy force my friend and we prevail not fated to return unmov automedon attends the fight implores the eternal and collects his might
full on my shoulder let their nostrils blow for hard the fight determined is the foe tis stern_hector comes and when he seeks the prize war knows no mean he wins it or he dies
then turning to his friend with dauntless mind oh keep the foaming courser close behind then through the field he sends his voice aloud and calls the ajaces from the warring crowd with great atrides
turn where distress demands immediate aid the dead encircled by his friend forego and save the living from a fiercer foe
hither turn he said unhelp we stand unequal to engage the force of stern_hector and ćneas rage yet mighty as they are my force to prove is only mine the event belongs to which_jove
he spoke and high the sounding javelin flung which pass the shield of aretus the young it pierced his belt emboss with curious art then in the lower belly struck the dart
as when a ponderous axe descending full cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull struck twixt the horns he spring with many a bound
then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground thus fell the youth the air his soul received and the spear trembled as his entrails heaved
now at automedon the trojan foe discharged his lance the meditated blow stooping he shunn the javelin idly fled and hiss innoxious er the hero head deep rooted in the ground the forceful spear in long vibrations spent its fury there
with clashing falchions now the chief had closed but each brave oilean_ajax heard and interposed nor longer stern_hector with his trojans stood but left their slain companion in his blood his arm automedon divests and cry accept patroclus this mean sacrifice thus have i soothed my grief and thus have paid poor as it is some offering to thy shade
so looks the lion er a mangled boar all grim with rage and horrible with gore high on the chariot at one bound he sprung and er his seat the bloody trophies hung
and now minerva from the realm of air descends impetuous and renews the war for pleased at length the grecian arm to aid the lord of thunder sent the blue eyed maid
as when high which_jove denouncing future woe er the dark cloud extends his purple bow in sign of tempests from the troubled air or from the rage of man destructive war the drooping cattle dread the impending sky and from his half till field the labourer fly in such a form the goddess round her drew a livid cloud and to the battle flew
assuming phoenix shape on earth she fall and in his well known voice to sparta calls and lies achilles friend beloved by all a prey to dog beneath the trojan wall
what shame greece for future time to tell to thee the greatest in whose cause he fell chief father
atreus son replies full of day by long experience wise_nestor what more desires my soul than here unmoved to guard the body of the man i loved
ah would minerva send me strength to rear this wearied arm and ward the storm of war but stern_hector like the rage of fire we dread and which_jove own glory blaze around his head
pleased to be first of all the power address she breathes new vigour in her hero breast and fills with keen revenge with fell despite desire of blood and rage and lust of fight
so burns the vengeful hornet soul all er repulsed in vain and thirsty still of gore bold son of air and heat on angry wing untamed untired he turns attacks and stings
fired with like ardour fierce atrides flew and sent his soul with every lance he threw there stood a trojan not unknown to fame aetion son and podes was his name
with riches honour and with courage bless by stern_hector loved his comrade and his guest through his broad belt the spear a passage found and ponderous as he fall his arm resound
sudden at stern_hector side apollo stood like phaenops asius son appear the god asius the great who held his wealthy reign in fair abydos by the rolling main
oh prince he cried oh foremost once in fame what grecian now shall tremble at thy name dost thou at length to great_menelaus yield a chief once thought no terror of the field
yet singly now the long disputed prize he bears victorious while our army fly by the same arm illustrious podes bled the friend of stern_hector unrevenged is dead
this heard er stern_hector spreads a cloud of woe rage lifts his lance and drives him on the foe but now the eternal shook his sable shield that shaded ide and all the subject field beneath its ample verge
a rolling cloud involved the mount the thunder roar aloud the affrighted hill from their foundations nod and blaze beneath the lightnings of the god at one regard of his all seeing eye
then trembled greece the flight peneleus led for as the brave boeotian turn his head to face the foe polydamas drew near and razed his shoulder with a shorten spear
by stern_hector wounded leitus quits the plain pierced through the wrist and raging with the pain grasps his once formidable lance in vain
as stern_hector follow idomen address the flaming javelin to his manly breast the brittle point before his corslet yields exulting troy with clamour fills the field high on his chariot the cretan stood the son of priam whirl the massive wood
but erring from its aim the impetuous spear struck to the dust the squire and charioteer of martial merion coeranus his name who left fair lyctus for the field of fame
the vanquish triumph and the victor fly on foot bold merion fought and now laid low had graced the triumphs of his trojan foe
but the brave squire the ready courser brought and with his life his master safety bought between his cheek and ear the weapon went
prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain his dying hand forgets the falling rein this merion reaches bending from the car and urges to desert the hopeless war
the teeth it shatter and the tongue it rent idomeneus consents the lash applies and the swift chariot to the navy fly
not oilean_ajax less the will of heaven descried and conquest shifting to the trojan side turn by the hand of which_jove
then thus begun to atreus seed the godlike ajax_telamon alas who sees not which_jove almighty hand transfers the glory to the trojan band
whether the weak or strong discharge the dart he guides each arrow to a grecian heart not so our spear incessant though they rain he suffers every lance to fall in vain
deserted of the god yet let us try what human strength and prudence can supply if yet this honour corse in triumph borne may glad the fleet that hope not our return who tremble yet scarce rescued from their fate and still hear stern_hector thundering at their gate
some hero too must be despatch to bear the mournful message to pelides ear for sure he knows not distant on the shore his friend his loved patroclus is no more
but such a chief i spy not through the host the man the steed the army all are lost in general darkness lord of earth and air
dispel this cloud the light of heaven restore give me to see and oilean_ajax asks no more if greece must perish we thy will obey
oh king oh father hear my humble prayer but let us perish in the face of day with tear the hero spoke and at his prayer
the god relenting clear the clouded air forth burst the sun with all enlightening ray the blaze of armour flash against the day
now now atrides cast around thy sight if yet antilochus survives the fight let him to great achilles ear convey
so turns the lion from the nightly fold though high in courage and with hunger bold long gall by herdsmen and long vex by hounds stiff with fatigue and fretted sore with wound the dart fly round him from a hundred hand and the red terror of the blazing brands till late reluctant at the dawn of day
sour he departs and quits the untasted prey so moved atrides from his dangerous place with weary limb but with unwilling pace the foe he fear might yet patroclus gain and much admonish much adjured his train guard these relics to your charge consign and bear the merits of the dead in mind how skill he was in each obliging art the mildest manner and the gentlest heart
the fatal news atrides hastes away he was alas but fate decreed his end in death a hero as in life a friend
as the bold bird endued with sharpest eye of all that wing the mid aerial sky the sacred eagle from his walks above looks down and sees the distant thicket move then stoops and sousing on the quivering hare snatches his life amid the cloud of air
not with less quickness his exerted sight pass this and that way through the rank of fight till on the left the chief he sought he found cheering his man and spreading death around
so part the chief from rank to rank he flew and round on all side sent his piercing view to him the king
beloved of which_jove draw near for sadder tidings never touch thy ear thy eye have witness what a fatal turn how ilion triumphs and the achaians mourn
fly to the fleet this instant fly and tell the sad achilles how his loved one fell he too may haste the naked corse to gain the arm are stern_hector who despoil the slain
this is not all patroclus on the shore now pale and dead shall succour greece no more the youthful warrior heard with silent woe from his fair eye the tear began to flow
big with the mighty grief he strove to say what sorrow dictates but no word found way to brave laodocus his arm he flung
who near him wheeling drove his steed along then ran the mournful message to impart with tearful eye and with dejected heart
swift fled the youth nor great_menelaus stands though sore distress to aid the pylian band but bids bold thrasymede those troop sustain himself return to his patroclus slain
gone is antilochus the hero said but hope not warrior for achilles aid though fierce his rage unbounded be his woe unarm he fight not with the trojan foe
tis in our hand alone our hope remain tis our own vigour must the dead regain and save ourselves while with impetuous hate troy pours along and this way rolls our fate
tis well said oilean_ajax be it then thy care with merion aid the weighty corse to rear myself and my bold brother will sustain the shock of stern_hector and his charging train
nor fear we army fighting side by side what troy can dare we have already tried have tried it and have stood
the hero said high from the ground the warrior heave the dead a general clamour rises at the sight loud shout the trojans and renew the fight
not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood with rage insatiate and with thirst of blood voracious hounds that many a length before their furious hunters drive the wounded boar but if the savage turns his glaring eye they howl aloof and round the forest fly
thus on retreating greece the trojans pour wave their thick falchions and their javelin shower but oilean_ajax turning to their fear they yield
while thus aloft the hero corse they bear behind them rage all the storm of war confusion tumult horror er the throng of man steed chariot urged the rout along
less fierce the wind with rising flame conspire to whelm some city under wave of fire now sink in gloomy cloud the proud abodes now crack the blazing temples of the god
all pale they tremble and forsake the field the rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls and sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles
as when two mules along the rugged road from the steep mountain with exerted strength drag some vast beam or mast unwieldy length inly they groan big drops of sweat distil the enormous timber lumbering down the hill
the hero sweat beneath their honour load so these behind the bulk of oilean_ajax stands and breaks the torrent of the rushing band
thus when a river swell with sudden rains spreads his broad water er the level plain some interposing hill the stream divides
and breaks its force and turns the winding tide still close they follow close the rear engage aeneas storm and stern_hector foams with rage
while greece a heavy thick retreat maintains wedged in one body like a flight of cranes that shriek incessant while the falcon hung high on poised pinions threats their callow young
so from the trojan chief the grecians fly such the wild terror and the mingled cry within without the trench and all the way strow in bright heap their arm and armour lay
such horror which_jove impress yet still proceeds the work of death and still the battle bleeds illustration vulcan from an antique gem
vulcan from an antique gem book xviii argument the grief of achilles and new armour made him by vulcan the news of the death of patroclus is brought to achilles by antilochus
thetis hearing his lamentations comes with all her sea nymphs to comfort him the speeches of the mother and son on this occasion
iris appears to achilles by the command of juno and order him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments
the sight of him turns the fortunes of the day and the body of patroclus is carried off by the greeks
the trojans call a council where stern_hector and polydamas disagree in their opinions but the advice of the former prevails to remain encamped in the field
the grief of achilles over the body of patroclus thetis goes to the palace of vulcan to obtain new arm for her son
the latter part of the nine and twentieth day and the night ensuing take up this book the scene is at achilles tent on the sea shore from whence it changes to the palace of vulcan
the description of the wonderful work of vulcan and lastly that noble one of the shield of achilles thus like the rage of fire the combat burns
meanwhile where hellespont broad water flow stood wise_nestor son the messenger of woe there sat achilles shaded by his sails on hoisted yards extended to the gales pensive he sat for all that fate design rose in sad prospect to his boding mind
and now it rises now it sinks by turns thus to his soul he said ah what constrains the greeks late victor now to quit the plain
is this the day which heaven so long ago ordain to sink me with the weight of woe so thetis warn when by a trojan hand
the bravest of the myrmidonian band should lose the light fulfilled is that decree fallen is the warrior and patroclus he
in vain i charged him soon to quit the plain and warn to shun hectorean force in vain thus while he thinks antilochus appears and tells the melancholy tale with tear
sad tidings son of peleus thou must hear and wretched i the unwilling messenger dead is patroclus for his corse they fight his naked corse his arm are stern_hector right
cast on the ground with furious hand he spread the scorching ashes er his graceful head his purple garments and his golden hair those he deforms with dust and these he tear on the hard soil his groaning breast he threw and roll and grovell as to earth he grew
the virgin captives with disorder charm won by his own or by patroclus arm rush from their tent with cry and gathering round beat their white breast and fainted on the ground
a sudden horror shot through all the chief and wrapp his sense in the cloud of grief while wise_nestor son sustains a manlier part and mourns the warrior with a warrior heart
hangs on his arm amidst his frantic woe and oft prevents the meditated blow far in the deep abysses of the main
with hoary nereus and the watery train the mother goddess from her crystal throne heard his loud cry and answer groan for groan
thalia glauce every watery name nesaea mild and silver spio came cymothoe and cymodoce were nigh and the blue languish of soft alia eye
their locks actaea and limnoria rear then proto doris panope appear thoa pherusa doto melita agave gentle and amphithoe gay next callianira callianassa show their sister looks dexamene the slow and swift dynamene now cut the tide iaera now the verdant wave divides
nemertes with apseudes lifts the head bright galatea quits her pearly bed these orythia clymene attend maera amphinome the train extend and black janira and janassa fair and amatheia with her amber hair
all these and all that deep in ocean held their sacred seat the glimmering grotto fill each beat her ivory breast with silent woe
the circling nereids with their mistress weep and all the sea green sisters of the deep till thetis sorrow thus began to flow hear me and judge ye sisters of the main
how just a cause has thetis to complain how wretched were i mortal were my fate how more than wretched in the immortal state
sprung from my bed a godlike hero came the bravest far that ever bore the name like some fair olive by my careful hand he grew he flourish and adorn the land to troy
i sent him but the fate ordain he never never must return again so short a space the light of heaven to view so short alas and fill with anguish too
i cannot ease them but i must deplore i go at least to bear a tender part and mourn my loved one with a mother heart

wide opening part the tide while the long pomp the silver wave divides approaching now they touch the trojan land then two by two ascended up the strand
the immortal mother standing close beside her mournful offspring to his sighs replied along the coast their mingled clamours ran and thus the silver footed dame began why mourns my son
thy late preferr request the god has granted and the greeks distress why mourns my son thy anguish let me share reveal the cause and trust a parent care

revenge itself is lost patroclus loved of all my martial train beyond mankind beyond myself is slain lost are those arm the god themselves
cursed be that day when all the power above thy charm submitted to a mortal love hadst thou still a sister of the main pursued the pleasures of the watery reign and happier peleus less ambitious led a mortal beauty to his equal bed
bestow on peleus stern_hector bears the glorious load ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb had caused such sorrow past and woe to come
for soon alas that wretched offspring slain new woe new sorrow shall create again tis not in fate the alternate now to give patroclus dead achilles hates to live

yes i will meet the murderer of my friend or if the god ordain it meet my end the stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun
the great alcides which_jove unequall son to juno hate at length resign his breath and sunk the victim of all conquering death
so shall achilles fall stretch pale and dead no more the grecian hope or trojan dread let me this instant rush into the field and reap what glory life short harvest yields
shall i not force some widow dame to tear with frantic hand her long dishevell hair shall i not force her breast to heave with sighs and the soft tear to trickle from her eye

thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew thrice to the sky the trojan clamours flew as oft the ajaces his assault sustain but check he turns repuls attacks again
with fiercer shouts his lingering troop he fire nor yields a step nor from his post retires so watchful shepherds strive to force in vain

yet a short interval and none shall dare expect a second summons to the war who waits for that the dire effects shall find
if trembling in the ship he lags behind embodied to the battle let us bend and all at once on haughty troy descend
and now the delegates ulysses sent to bear the presents from the royal tent the son of wise_nestor phyleus valiant heir thias and merion thunderbolts of war with lycomedes of creiontian strain and melanippus form the chosen train
twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid a row of six fair tripods then succeeds and twice the number of high bounding steed seven captives next a lovely line compose the eighth briseis like the blooming rose closed the bright band great ithacus before first of the train the golden talents bore
swift as the word was given the youth obey the rest in public view the chief dispose a splendid scene
then agamemnon rose the boar talthybius held the grecian lord drew the broad cutlass sheath beside his sword the stubborn bristles from the victim brow he crops and offering meditates his vow
his hand uplifted to the attesting sky on heaven broad marble roof were fixed his eye the solemn word a deep attention draw and greece around sat thrill with sacred awe
witness thou first thou greatest power above all good all wise_nestor and all surveying which_jove and mother earth and heaven revolving light and ye fell fury of the realm of night
who rule the dead and horrid woe prepare for perjured king and all who falsely swear the black eyed maid inviolate removes pure and unconscious of my manly love
with that his weapon deep inflicts the wound the bleeding savage tumbles to the ground the sacred herald rolls the victim slain a feast for fish into the foaming main
if this be false heaven all its vengeance shed and levell thunder strike my guilty head then thus achilles hear ye greeks
we feel tis which_jove inflicts the woe not else atrides could our rage inflame nor from my arm unwilling force the dame
and know whate er twas which_jove high will alone erruling all that doom our strife and doom the greeks to fall go then ye chief
indulge the genial rite achilles waits ye and expects the fight the speedy council at his word adjourn to their black vessel all the greeks return
achilles sought his tent his train before march onward bending with the gift they bore those in the tent the squires industrious spread
the foaming courser to the stalls they led to their new seat the female captives move briseis radiant as the queen of love slow as she pass beheld with sad survey where gash with cruel wound patroclus lay
prone on the body fell the heavenly fair beat her sad breast and tore her golden hair all beautiful in grief her humid eye shining with tear she lifts and thus she cry ah youth for ever dear for ever kind once tender friend of my distracted mind
i left thee fresh in life in beauty gay now find thee cold inanimated clay what woe my wretched race of life attend
sorrow on sorrow never doom to end the first loved consort of my virgin bed before these eye in fatal battle bled
my three brave brother in one mournful day all trod the dark irremeable way thy friendly hand uprear me from the plain and dried my sorrow for a husband slain achilles care you promised
the first the dearest partner of his love that rite divine should ratify the band and make me empress in his native land
i should prove accept these grateful tear for thee they flow for thee that ever felt another woe her sister captives echoed groan for groan nor mourn patroclus fortunes but their own
if yet achilles have a friend whose care is bent to please him this request forbear till yonder sun descend ah let me pay to grief and anguish one abstemious day
he spoke and from the warrior turn his face yet still the brother king of atreus race wise_nestor idomeneus ulysses sage and phoenix strive to calm his grief and rage
the leader press the chief on every side unmoved he heard them and with sighs denied his rage they calm not nor his grief control he groans he raves he sorrow from his soul
once spread the inviting banquet in our tent thy sweet society thy winning care once stay achilles rushing to the war
thou too patroclus thus his heart he vents but now alas to death cold arm resign what banquet but revenge can glad my mind
what greater sorrow could afflict my breast what more if hoary peleus were deceased who now perhaps in phthia dreads to hear his son sad fate and drops a tender tear
what more should neoptolemus the brave my only offspring sink into the grave if yet that offspring life i distant far of all neglectful wage a hateful war
i hoped patroclus might survive to rear my tender orphan with a parent care from scyros isle conduct him er the main and glad his eye with his paternal reign the lofty palace and the large domain
i could not this this cruel stroke attend fate claim achilles but might spare his friend for peleus breathes no more the vital air or drags a wretched life of age and care
but till the news of my sad fate invades his hastening soul and sinks him to the shade sighing he said his grief the hero join each stole a tear for what he left behind
thus with pity to his blue eyed maid is then achilles now no more thy care and dost thou thus desert the great in war
all comfortless he sits and wails his friend ere thirst and want his force have oppress haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast
their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey and lo where yon sails their canvas wing extend he spoke and sudden at the word of which_jove shot the descending goddess from above
so swift through ether the shrill harpy spring the wide air floating to her ample wing to great achilles she her flight address
and pour divine ambrosia in his breast with nectar sweet refection of the god then swift ascending sought the bright abodes
as when the piercing blasts of boreas blow and scatter er the field the driving snow from dusky cloud the fleecy winter fly whose dazzling lustre whitens all the sky so helms succeeding helms so shield from shield catch the quick beams and brighten all the field broad glittering breastplates spear with pointed rays mix in one stream reflecting blaze on blaze thick beats the centre as the courser bound with splendour flame the sky and laugh the field around
full in the midst high towering er the rest his limb in arm divine achilles dress arm which the father of the fire bestow forged on the eternal anvils of the god
grief and revenge his furious heart inspire his glowing eyeballs roll with living fire he grinds his teeth and furious with delay erlooks the embattled host and hope the bloody day
the silver cuishes first his thighs infold then er his breast was braced the hollow gold the brazen sword a various baldric tied that starr with gems hung glittering at his side and like the moon the broad refulgent shield blazed with long rays and gleam athwart the field
so to night wandering sailors pale with fear wide er the watery waste a light appears which on the far seen mountain blazing high stream from some lonely watch tower to the sky with mournful eye they gaze and gaze again loud howls the storm and drives them er the main
next his high head the helmet graced behind the sweepy crest hung floating in the wind like the red star that from his flaming hair shakes down diseases pestilence and war so stream the golden honour from his head trembled the sparkling plumes and the loose glory shed
the chief beholds himself with wondering eye his arm he poises and his motions tries buoy by some inward force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb
and now he shakes his great paternal spear ponderous and huge which not a greek could rear from pelion cloudy top an ash entire old chiron fell and shaped it for his sire a spear which stern_hector achilles only wields the death of hero and the dread of field
now issued from the ship the warrior train and like a deluge pour upon the plain automedon and alcimus prepare the immortal courser and the radiant car
the silver traces sweeping at their side their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied the ivory studded rein return behind waved er their backs and to the chariot join
all bright in heavenly arm above his squire achilles mounts and sets the field on fire not brighter phoebus in the ethereal way flame from his chariot and restores the day
the charioteer then whirl the lash around and swift ascended at one active bound high er the host all terrible he stands and thunder to his steed these dread command
xanthus and balius of podarges strain unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain be swift be mindful of the load ye bear and learn to make your master more your care through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword nor as ye left patroclus leave your lord
the generous xanthus as the word he said seem sensible of woe and droop his head trembling he stood before the golden wain and bow to dust the honour of his mane
this day at least we bear thy rage in safety through the files of war but come it will the fatal time must come not ours the fault but god decrees thy doom
not through our crime or slowness in the course fell thy patroclus but by heavenly force the bright far shooting god who gilds the day confess we saw him tore his arm way
when strange to tell so juno will he broke eternal silence and portentous spoke achilles yes no could our swiftness er the wind prevail or beat the pinions of the western gale
all were in vain the fate thy death demand due to a mortal and immortal hand then ceased for ever by the fury tied his fateful voice
the intrepid chief replied with unabated rage so let it be portents and prodigies are lost on me i know my fate to die to see no more my much loved parent and my native shore enough
when heaven ordains i sink in night now perish troy he said and rush to fight illustration hercules hercules book xx
argument the battle of the god and the acts of achilles jupiter upon achilles return to the battle calls a council of the god and permits them to assist either party
the terror of the combat described when the deities are engaged apollo encourages ćneas to meet achilles after a long conversation these two hero encounter but ćneas is preserved by the assistance of neptune
achilles fall upon the rest of the trojans and is upon the point of killing stern_hector but apollo conveys him away in a cloud
achilles pursues the trojans with a great slaughter the same day continues the scene is in the field before troy thus round pelides breathing war and blood greece sheathed in arm beside her vessel stood
then which_jove to themis gives command to call the god to council in the starry hall swift er olympus hundred hill she fly and summons all the senate of the sky
while near impending from a neighbouring height troy black battalions wait the shock of fight these shining on in long procession come to which_jove eternal adamantine dome
not one was absent not a rural power that haunts the verdant gloom or rosy bower each fair hair dryad of the shady wood each azure sister of the silver flood all but old ocean hoary sire who keeps his ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps
even he whose trident sways the watery reign heard the loud summons and forsook the main assumed his throne amid the bright abodes and question thus the sire of man and god
what moves the god who heaven and earth command and grasps the thunder in his awful hand thus to convene the whole ethereal state
on marble throne with lucid columns crown the work of vulcan sat the power around is greece and troy the subject in debate
already met the louring host appear and death stands ardent on the edge of war tis true the cloud compelling power replies
this day we call the council of the sky in care of human race even which_jove own eye sees with regret unhappy mortal die
far on olympus top in secret state ourself will sit and see the hand of fate work out our will celestial power
descend and as your mind direct your succour lend to either host troy soon must lie erthrown if uncontroll achilles fight alone their troop but lately durst not meet his eye
what can they now if in his rage he rise assist them god or ilion sacred wall may fall this day though fate forbids the fall
he said and fired their heavenly breast with rage on adverse part the warring god engage heaven awful queen and he
hermes of profitable art the sire and vulcan the black sovereign of the fire these to the fleet repair with instant flight the vessel tremble as the god alight
in aid of troy latona phoebus came mars fiery helm the laughter loving dame xanthus whose stream in golden currents flow and the chaste huntress of the silver bow
each argive bosom swell with manly joy while great achilles terror of the plain long lost to battle shone in arm again
dreadful he stood in front of all his host pale troy beheld and seem already lost her bravest hero pant with inward fear and trembling see another god of war
but when the power descending swell the fight then tumult rose fierce rage and pale affright varied each face then discord sound alarm earth echoes and the nation rush to arm
whose azure round girds the vast globe the maid in arm renown ere yet the god their various aid employ now through the trembling shore minerva calls and now she thunder from the grecian wall
in gloomy tempests and a night of cloud now through each trojan heart he fury pours with voice divine from ilion topmost tower now shouts to simois from her beauteous hill the mountain shook the rapid stream stood still
mars hovering er his troy his terror shrouds above the sire of god his thunder rolls and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles
beneath stern_hector neptune shakes the solid ground the forests wave the mountain nod around through all their summits tremble ida wood and from their sources boil her hundred flood
troy turrets totter on the rocking plain and the toss navy beat the heaving main deep in the dismal regions of the dead
his horrid head leap from his throne lest neptune arm should lay his dark dominions open to the day and pour in light on pluto drear abodes abhorr by man and dreadful even to god
such war the immortals wage such horror rend the world vast concave when the god contend first silver shafted phoebus took the plain against blue neptune monarch of the main
the infernal monarch rear illustration the god descending to battle the god descending to battle the god of arm his giant bulk display opposed to pallas war triumphant maid
against latona march the son of may the quiver dian sister of the day her golden arrow sounding at her side
with fiery vulcan last in battle stands the sacred flood that rolls on golden sands xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth but called scamander by the son of earth
while thus the god in various league engage achilles glow with more than mortal rage stern_hector he sought in search of stern_hector turn d
saturnia majesty of heaven defied his eye around for stern_hector only burn and burst like lightning through the rank and vow d
ćneas was the first who dared to stay apollo wedged him in the warrior way but swell his bosom with undaunted might half forced and half persuaded to the fight
to glut the god of battle with his blood like young lycaon of the royal line in voice and aspect seem the power divine
then thus the hero of anchises strain to meet pelides you persuade in vain already have i met nor void of fear observed the fury of his flying spear from ida wood he chased us to the field our force he scattered and our herds he kill lyrnessus pedasus in ashes lay but which_jove assisting
and bade the chief reflect how late with scorn in distant threats he braved the goddess born i survived the day else had i sunk oppress in fatal fight by fierce achilles and minerva might
where er he moved the goddess shone before and bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore what mortal man achilles can sustain
the immortals guard him through the dreadful plain and suffer not his dart to fall in vain were god my aid this arm should check his power though strong in battle as a brazen tower
from heavenly venus thou deriv st thy strain and he but from a sister of the main an aged sea god father of his line but which_jove himself the sacred source of thine
to whom the son of which_jove that god implore and be what great achilles was before then lift thy weapon for a noble blow nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe
this said and spirit breathed into his breast through the thick troop the embolden hero press his venturous act the white arm queen survey and thus assembling all the power she said behold an action god
that claims your care lo great ćneas rushing to the war against pelides he directs his course phoebus impels and phoebus gives him force
restrain his bold career at least to attend our favour hero let some power descend to guard his life and add to his renown we the great armament of heaven came down
hereafter let him fall as fate design that spun so short his life illustrious line but lest some adverse god now cross his way give him to know what power assist this day
for how shall mortal stand the dire alarm when heaven refulgent host appear in arm thus she and thus the god whose force can make the solid globe eternal basis shake
against the might of man so feeble known why should celestial power exert their own suffice from yonder mount to view the scene and leave to war the fate of mortal man
thence on the god of troy we swift descend full soon i doubt not shall the conflict end and these in ruin and confusion hurl yield to our conquering arm the lower world
but if the armipotent or god of light obstruct achilles or commence the fight thus having said the tyrant of the sea coerulean neptune rose and led the way
advanced upon the field there stood a mound of earth congested wall and trench around in elder time to guard alcides made the work of trojans with minerva aid
what time a vengeful monster of the main swept the wide shore and drove him to the plain here neptune and the god of greece repair with cloud encompass and a veil of air
in circle close each heavenly party sat intent to form the future scheme of fate but mix not yet in fight though which_jove on high gives the loud signal and the heaven reply
the adverse power around apollo laid crown the fair hill that silver simois shade meanwhile the rushing army hide the ground the trampled centre yields a hollow sound
steed cased in mail and chief in armour bright the gleaming champaign glows with brazen light amid both host a dreadful space appear there great achilles bold ćneas here
with towering strides aeneas first advanced the nodding plumage on his helmet danced spread er his breast the fencing shield he bore
and so he moved his javelin flamed before not so pelides furious to engage he rush impetuous such the lion rage
who viewing first his foe with scornful eye though all in arm the peopled city rise stalks careless on with unregarding pride
till at the length by some brave youth defied to his bold spear the savage turns alone he murmurs fury with a hollow groan he grins he foams he rolls his eye around lash by his tail his heaving side resound he calls up all his rage he grinds his teeth resolved on vengeance or resolved on death
ere yet the stern_hector encounter join begun the seed of thetis thus to venus son why comes ćneas through the rank so far
so fierce achilles on ćneas fly so stands ćneas and his force defies seeks he to meet achilles arm in war
grant that beneath thy lance achilles dies the partial monarch may refuse the prize son he has many those thy pride may quell and tis his fault to love those son too well or in reward of thy victorious hand has troy proposed some spacious tract of land
in hope the realm of priam to enjoy and prove his merits to the throne of troy an ample forest or a fair domain of hill for vines and arable for grain
even this perhaps will hardly prove thy lot but can achilles be so soon forgot once as i think you saw this brandish spear
and then the great ćneas seem to fear with hearty haste from ida mount he fled nor till he reach lyrnessus turn his head
her lofty wall not long our progress stay those pallas which_jove and we in ruin laid in grecian chains her captive race were cast tis true the great aeneas fled too fast
defrauded of my conquest once before what then i lost the god this day restore go while thou may st avoid the threaten fate fools stay to feel it and are wise_nestor too late
to this anchises son such word employ to one that fear thee some unwarlike boy such we disdain the best may be defied with mean reproaches and unmanly pride unworthy the high race from which we came proclaim so loudly by the voice of fame each from illustrious father draws his line each goddess born half human half divine
thetis this day or venus offspring dies and tear shall trickle from celestial eye for when two hero thus derived contend tis not in word the glorious strife can end
a tale resounded through the spacious earth hear how the glorious origin we prove from ancient dardanus the first from which_jove
if yet thou further seek to learn my birth dardania wall he raised for ilion then the city since of many languaged man was not
from dardanus great erichthonius spring the richest once of asia wealthy king three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred three thousand foals beside their mother fed
the natives were content to till the shady foot of ida fountful hill boreas enamour of the sprightly train conceal his godhead in a flowing mane
and coursed the dappled beauty er the mead hence sprung twelve other of unrivall kind swift as their mother mares and father wind
these lightly skimming when they swept the plain nor plied the grass nor bent the tender grain and when along the level sea they flew
with voice dissembled to his love he neigh scarce on the surface curl the briny dew such erichthonius was from him there came the sacred tros of whom the trojan name
three son renown adorn his nuptial bed ilus assaracus and ganymed the matchless ganymed divinely fair whom heaven enamour snatch to upper air
to bear the cup of which_jove ethereal guest the grace and glory of the ambrosial feast the two remaining son the line divide
first rose laomedon from ilus side from him tithonus now in care grown old and priam bless with stern_hector brave and bold clytius and lampus ever honour pair and hicetaon thunderbolt of war
from great assaracus sprang capys he begat anchises and anchises me such is our race tis fortune gives us birth but which_jove alone endues the soul with worth
long in the field of word we may contend reproach is infinite and knows no end arm or with truth or falsehood right or wrong so voluble a weapon is the tongue wounded we wound and neither side can fail for every man has equal strength to rail women alone when in the streets they jar perhaps excel us in this wordy war like us they stand encompass with the crowd and vent their anger impotent and loud
he source of power and might with boundless sway all human courage gives or takes away cease then our business in the field of fight is not to question but to prove our might
to all those insults thou hast offer here receive this answer tis my flying spear he spoke with all his force the javelin flung fix deep and loudly in the buckler rung
far on his outstretch arm pelides held to meet the thundering lance his dreadful shield that trembled as it stuck nor void of fear saw ere it fell the immeasurable spear
his fear were vain impenetrable charm secured the temper of the ethereal arm through two strong plates the point its passage held but stopp and rested by the third
five plates of various metal various mould composed the shield of brass each outward fold of tin each inward and the middle gold there stuck the lance
repell then rising ere he threw the forceful spear of great achilles flew and pierced the dardan shield extremest bound where the shrill brass return d
ćneas his contracted body bends and er him high the riven targe extends sees through its parting plates the upper air
a sharper sound through the thin verge the pelean weapon glides and the slight covering of expanded hides and at his back perceives the quivering spear
a fate so near him chills his soul with fright and swims before his eye the many colour light achilles rushing in with dreadful cry draws his broad blade and at ćneas fly
ćneas rousing as the foe came on with force collected heaves a mighty stone a mass enormous which in modern day
no two of earth degenerate son could raise but ocean god whose earthquakes rock the ground saw the distress and moved the power around
lo on the brink of fate ćneas stands an instant victim to achilles hand by phoebus urged but phoebus has bestow d
his aid in vain the man erpowers the god and can ye see this righteous chief atone with guiltless blood for vices not his own
to all the god his constant vows were paid sure though he war for troy he claims our aid fate wills not this nor thus can which_jove resign the future father of the dardan line
for priam now and priam faithless kind at length are odious to the all seeing mind on great ćneas shall devolve the reign and son succeeding son the lasting line sustain
the first great ancestor obtain his grace and still his love descends on all the race the great earth shaker thus to whom replies the imperial goddess with the radiant eye
good as he is to immolate or spare the dardan prince neptune be thy care pallas and i by all that god can bind have sworn destruction to the trojan kind not even an instant to protract their fate or save one member of the sinking state till her last flame be quench with her last gore and even her crumbling ruin are no more
the king of ocean to the fight descends through all the whistling dart his course he bends swift interposed between the warrior fly and casts thick darkness er achilles eye
from great ćneas shield the spear he drew and at his master foot the weapon threw that done with force divine he
the dardan prince and bore him through the sky smooth gliding without step above the head of warring hero and of bounding steed till at the battle utmost verge they light where the slow caucans close the rear of fight
snatch on high the godhead there his heavenly form confess with word like these the panting chief address what power prince
with force inferior far urged thee to meet achilles arm in war henceforth beware nor antedate thy doom defrauding fate of all thy fame to come
but when the day decreed for come it must shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust let then the fury of that arm be known secure
with that he left him wondering as he lay then from achilles chased the mist away sudden returning with a stream of light the scene of war came rushing on his sight
my spear that parted on the wing of wind laid here before me and the dardan lord that fell this instant vanish from my sword
no grecian force transcends thy own then thus amazed what wonders strike my mind i thought alone with mortal to contend but power celestial sure this foe defend
great as he is our arm he scarce will try content for once with all his god to fly now then let other bleed
this said aloud he vents his fury and inflames the crowd greeks he cry and every rank alarm join battle man to man and arm to arm
tis not in me though favour by the sky to mow whole troop and make whole army fly no god can singly such a host engage not mars himself nor great minerva rage
but whatsoe er achilles can inspire whate er of active force or acting fire whate er this heart can prompt or hand obey all all achilles greeks is yours to day
through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear and thin the squadrons with my single spear he said nor less elate with martial joy the godlike stern_hector warm the troop of troy trojans to war
think stern_hector leads you on nor dread the vaunts of peleus haughty son deed must decide our fate en these with word
insult the brave who tremble at their sword the weakest atheist wretch all heaven defies but shrinks and shudders when the thunder fly
nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire not though his heart were steel his hand were fire that fire that steel your stern_hector should withstand and brave that vengeful heart that dreadful hand
a wood of lance rises round his head clamours on clamours tempest all the air they join they throng they thicken to the war
but phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun the single fight with thetis godlike son more safe to combat in the mingled band nor tempt too near the terror of his hand
thus breathing rage through all the hero said he hears obedient to the god of light and plunged within the rank awaits the fight
first fall iphytion at his army head brave was the chief and brave the host he led from great otrynteus he derived his blood his mother was a nais of the flood beneath the shade of tmolus crown with snow from hyde wall he ruled the land below
then fierce achilles shouting to the sky on troy whole force with boundless fury fly fierce as he spring the sword his head divides the parted visage fall on equal side
with loud resounding arm he strikes the plain while thus achilles glory er the slain lie there otryntides the trojan earth receives thee dead though gygae boast thy birth those beauteous field where hyllus wave are roll
and plenteous hermus swells with tide of gold are thine no more the insulting hero said and left him sleeping in eternal shade
the rolling wheels of greece the body tore and dash their axles with no vulgar gore demoleon next antenor offspring laid breathless in dust the price of rashness paid
the impatient steel with full descending sway forced through his brazen helm its furious way resistless drove the batter skull before and dash and mingled all the brains with gore
this sees hippodamas and seized with fright deserts his chariot for a swifter flight the lance arrests him an ignoble wound
he groans away his soul not louder roars at neptune shrine on helice high shore the victim bull the rock re bellow round and ocean listens to the grateful sound
the panting trojan rivets to the ground then fell on polydore his vengeful rage the youngest hope of priam stooping age
whose foot for swiftness in the race surpass of all his son the dearest and the last to the forbidden field he takes his flight
in the first folly of a youthful knight to vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain but vaunts not long with all his swiftness slain
the double back plate join forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel and on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell the rushing entrails pour upon the ground his hand collect and darkness wraps him round
when stern_hector view all ghastly in his gore thus sadly slain the unhappy polydore a cloud of sorrow overcast his sight
struck where the crossing belts unite behind and golden rings his soul no longer brook the distant fight full in achilles dreadful front he came and shook his javelin like a waving flame
the son of peleus sees with joy possess his heart high bounding in his rising breast and lo the man on whom black fate attend the man that slew achilles is his friend
no more shall stern_hector and pelides spear turn from each other in the walks of war then with revengeful eye he scann him er come and receive thy fate
he spake no more stern_hector undaunted thus such word employ to one that dreads thee some unwarlike boy such we could give defying and defied
mean intercourse of obloquy and pride i know thy force to mine superior far but heaven alone confers success in war
mean as i am the god may guide my dart and give it entrance in a braver heart then part the lance but pallas heavenly breath far from achilles wafts the winged death
the bidden dart again to stern_hector fly and at the foot of its great master lies achilles closes with his hated foe his heart and eye with flaming fury glow
but present to his aid apollo shrouds the favour hero in a veil of cloud thrice struck pelides with indignant heart
thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart the spear a fourth time buried in the cloud he foams with fury and exclaims aloud wretch
thou hast scaped again once more thy flight has saved thee and the partial god of light but long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand
if any power assist achilles hand fly then inglorious but thy flight this day whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay
with that he gluts his rage on number slain then dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain pierced through the neck he left him panting there and
stopp demuchus great philetor heir gigantic chief deep gash the enormous blade and for the soul an ample passage made
laoganus and dardanus expire the valiant son of an unhappy sire both in one instant from the chariot hurl sunk in one instant to the nether world
nor less unpitied young alastor bleeds in vain his youth in vain his beauty pleads in vain he begs thee with a suppliant moan to spare a form an age so like thy own
this difference only their sad fate afford that one the spear destroy and one the sword unhappy boy no prayer no moving art er bent that fierce inexorable heart
while yet he trembled at his knees and cried the ruthless falchion oped his tender side the panting liver pours a flood of gore that drowns his bosom till he pants no more
next the sword bereaves deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves warm in the brain the smoking weapon lies the purple death comes floating er his eye
then brave deucalion died the dart was flung where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung he dropp his arm an unassisting weight and stood all impotent expecting fate
through mulius head then drove the impetuous spear the warrior fall transfix from ear to ear thy life echeclus full on his neck the falling falchion sped from his broad shoulder hew his crested head
rhigmas whose race from fruitful thracia came the son of pierus an illustrious name succeeds to fate the spear his belly rends prone from his car the thundering chief descends
forth from the bone the spinal marrow fly and sunk in dust the corpse extended lies the squire who saw expiring on the ground his prostrate master rein the steed around
as when a flame the winding valley fills and runs on crackling shrubs between the hill then er the stubble up the mountain fly fire the high wood and blaze to the sky this way and that the spreading torrent roars so sweeps the hero through the wasted shore around him wide immense destruction pours and earth is deluged with the sanguine showers as with autumnal harvests cover o er and thick bestrewn lies ceres sacred floor when round and round with never wearied pain the trampling steers beat out the unnumber grain
so the fierce courser as the chariot rolls tread down whole rank and crush out hero soul dash from their hoofs while er the dead they fly black bloody drops the smoking chariot dye
his back scarce turn the pelian javelin gored and stretch the servant er his dying lord the spiky wheels through heap of carnage tore and thick the groaning axles dropp with gore
high er the scene of death achilles stood all grim with dust all horrible in blood yet still insatiate still with rage on flame such is the lust of never dying fame
the trojans fly before achilles some towards the town other to the river scamander he fall upon the latter with great slaughter takes twelve captives alive to sacrifice to the shade of patroclus and kills lycaon and asteropeus
scamander attacks him with all his wave neptune and pallas assist the hero simois joins scamander at length vulcan by the instigation of juno almost dries up the river
illustration centaur centaur book xxi argument the battle in the river scamander this combat ended the other god engage each other
agenor only makes a stand and is conveyed away in a cloud by apollo who to delude achilles takes upon him agenor shape and while he pursues him in that disguise gives the trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city
meanwhile achilles continues the slaughter drives the rest into troy the same day continues the scene is on the banks and in the stream of scamander
the river here divides the flying train part to the town fly diverse er the plain where late their troop triumphant bore the fight now chased and trembling in ignoble flight
and now to xanthus gliding stream they drove xanthus immortal progeny of which_jove these with a gathered mist saturnia shrouds and rolls behind the rout a heap of cloud
with cry promiscuous all the banks resound and here and there in eddies whirling round the flouncing steed and shrieking warrior drown
as the scorch locusts from their field retire while fast behind them runs the blaze of fire driven from the land before the smoky cloud the clustering legions rush into the flood
part plunge into the stream old xanthus roars the flashing billows beat the whiten shore so plunged in xanthus by achilles force roars the resounding surge with man and horse
his bloody lance the hero casts aside which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide then like a god the rapid billows braves arm with his sword high brandish d
now he whirls it round deep groan the water with the dying sound repeated wound the reddening river dyed and the warm purple circled on the tide
o er the wave now down he plunges swift through the foamy flood the trojans fly and close in rock or winding caverns lie
so the huge dolphin tempesting the main in shoals before him fly the scaly train confusedly heap they seek their inmost caves or pant and heave beneath the floating wave
now tired with slaughter from the trojan band twelve chosen youth he drags alive to land with their rich belts their captive arm restrains late their proud ornaments but now their chains
sad victim destined to patroclus shade then as once more he plunged amid the flood the young lycaon in his passage stood the son of priam whom the hero hand but late made captive in his father land as from a sycamore his sounding steel lopp the green arm to spoke a chariot wheel
to lemnos isle he sold the royal slave where jason son the price demanded gave but kind eetion touching on the shore the ransom prince to fair arisbe bore
these his attendants to the ship convey ten day were past since in his father reign he felt the sweets of liberty again
the next that god whom man in vain withstand gives the same youth to the same conquering hand now never to return and doom to go a sadder journey to the shade below
the helm and visor he had cast aside with wild affright and dropp upon the field his useless lance and unavailing shield
his well known face when great achilles eyed as trembling panting from the stream he fled and knock his faltering knees the hero said
ye mighty god what wonders strike my view is it in vain our conquering arm subdue sure i shall see yon heap of trojans
kill rise from the shade and brave me on the field as now the captive whom so late i bound and sold to lemnos stalks on trojan ground
not him the sea unmeasured deeps detain that bar such number from their native plain lo he return try then my flying spear
try if the grave can hold the wanderer if earth at length this active prince can seize earth whose strong grasp has held down hercules
thus while he spoke the trojan pale with fear approach and sought his knees with suppliant tear loth as he was to yield his youthful breath and his soul shivering at the approach of death
achilles raised the spear prepared to wound he kiss his foot extended on the ground and while above the spear suspended stood longing to dip its thirsty point in blood one hand embraced them close
one stopp the dart while thus these melting word attempt his heart thy well known captive great achilles see once more lycaon trembles at thy knee
whom late thy conquering arm to lemnos bore far from his father friend and native shore a hundred oxen were his price that day
some pity to a suppliant name afford who shared the gift of ceres at thy board now sums immense thy mercy shall repay
scarce respited from woe i yet appear and scarce twelve morning sun have seen me here lo which_jove again submits me to thy hand again her victim cruel fate demands
i sprang from priam and laothoe fair old altes daughter and lelegia heir who held in pedasus his famed abode and ruled the field where silver satnio flow
two son alas unhappy son she bore for ah one spear shall drink each brother gore and i succeed to slaughter polydore
how from that arm of terror shall i fly some demon urges tis my doom to die if ever yet soft pity touch thy mind ah think not me too much of stern_hector kind
these word attended with a shower of tear the youth address to unrelenting ear talk not of life or ransom he replies patroclus dead whoever meets me dies in vain a single trojan sues for grace
not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath with his who wrought thy loved patroclus death but least the son of priam hateful race
die then my friend what boots it to deplore the great the good patroclus is no more he far thy better was foredoom to die and thou dost thou bewail mortality
seest thou not me whom nature gift adorn sprung from a hero from a goddess born the day shall come which nothing can avert
when by the spear the arrow or the dart by night or day by force or by design impending death and certain fate are mine
die then he said and as the word he spoke the fainting stripling sank before the stroke his hand forgot its grasp and left the spear while all his trembling frame confess his fear sudden achilles his broad sword display and buried in his neck the reeking blade
prone fell the youth and panting on the land the gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand the victor to the stream the carcase gave and thus insults him floating on the wave
lie there lycaon let the fish surround thy bloated corpse and suck thy gory wound there no sad mother shall thy funerals weep but swift scamander roll thee to the deep
whose every wave some watery monster brings to feast unpunish on the fat of king so perish troy and all the trojan line
such ruin theirs and such compassion mine what boots ye now scamander worshipp stream his earthly honour and immortal name in vain your immolated bulls are slain your living courser glut his gulfs in vain
thus he rewards you with this bitter fate thus till the grecian vengeance is complete thus is atoned patroclus honour shade and the short absence of achilles paid
these boastful word provoked the raging god with fury swells the violated flood what means divine may yet the power employ to check achilles and to rescue troy
meanwhile the hero spring in arm to dare the great asteropeus to mortal war the son of pelagon whose lofty line flows from the source of axius stream divine
he fearless stood and shook two spear advancing from the flood the flood impell him on pelides head to avenge his water choked with heap of dead
fair peribaea love the god had crown with all his refluent water circled round on him achilles rush near as they drew achilles thus began what art thou boldest of the race of man
who or from whence unhappy is the sire whose son encounters our resistless ire son of peleus what avails to trace
from rich paeonia valleys i command arm with protended spear my native band now shines the tenth bright morning since i came
replied the warrior our illustrious race in aid of ilion to the field of fame axius who swells with all the neighbouring rills
and wide around the floated region fills begot my sire whose spear much glory won now lift thy arm and try that hero son
threatening he said the hostile chief advance at once asteropeus discharged each lance for both his dexterous hand the lance could wield
one struck but pierced not the vulcanian shield one razed achilles hand the spouting blood spun forth in earth the fasten weapon stood
its erring fury hiss along the sky deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear even to the middle earth and quiver there
like lightning next the pelean javelin fly then from his side the sword pelides drew and on his foe with double fury flew
the foe thrice tugg and shook the rooted wood repulsive of his might the weapon stood the fourth he tries to break the spear in vain
bent as he stands he tumbles to the plain his belly open with a ghastly wound the reeking entrails pour upon the ground
beneath the hero foot he panting lies and his eye darkens and his spirit fly while the proud victor thus triumphing said his radiant armour tearing from the dead so ends thy glory
such the fate they prove who strive presumptuous with the son of which_jove sprung from a river didst thou boast thy line
but great saturnius is the source of mine how durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny of peleus ćacus and which_jove am i the race of these superior far to those
as he that thunder to the stream that flows what rivers can scamander might have shown but which_jove he dreads nor war against his son
the eternal ocean from whose fountains flow the sea the rivers and the spring below the thundering voice of which_jove abhors to hear
even achelous might contend in vain and all the roaring billows of the main and in his deep abysses shakes with fear
the floating tide the bloody carcase lave and beat against it wave succeeding wave till roll between the banks it lies the food of curling eels and fishes of the flood
he said then from the bank his javelin tore and left the breathless warrior in his gore all scatter round the stream their mightiest slain
the amazed paeonians scour along the plain he vents his fury on the flying crew thrasius astyplus and mnesus slew mydon thersilochus with ćnius fell and number more his lance had plunged to hell
but from the bottom of his gulfs profound scamander spoke the shore return the sound first of mortal for the god are thine
in valour matchless and in force divine if which_jove have given thee every trojan head tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead
see my choked stream no more their course can keep nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep turn then impetuous from our injured flood content thy slaughter could amaze a god
in human form confess before his eye the river thus and thus the chief replies sacred stream thy word we shall obey
shall pant and tremble at our arm again not till proud stern_hector guardian of her wall or stain this lance or see achilles fall
but not till troy the destined vengeance pay not till within her tower the perjured train he said and drove with fury on the foe
was not the mandate of the sire above full and express that phoebus should employ his sacred arrow in defence of troy and make her conquer till hyperion fall in awful darkness hide the face of all
then to the godhead of the silver bow the yellow flood began son of which_jove he spoke in vain
then rising in his rage above the shore from all his deep the bellowing river roars huge heap of slain disgorges on the coast and round the banks the ghastly dead are toss
the chief without dismay ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way while all before the billows ranged on high a watery bulwark screen the band who fly
now bursting on his head with thundering sound the falling deluge whelms the hero round his loaded shield bends to the rushing tide his foot upborne scarce the strong flood divide sliddering and staggering
on the border stood a spreading elm that overhung the flood he seized a bending bough his steps to stay the plant uprooted to his weight gave way
heaving the bank and undermining all loud flash the water to the rushing fall of the thick foliage the large trunk display bridged the rough flood across the hero
stay on this his weight and raised upon his hand leap from the channel and regain the land then blacken the wild wave the murmur rose
the god pursues a huger billow throws and bursts the bank ambitious to destroy the man whose fury is the fate of troy
far as a spear can fly achilles spring at every bound his clanging armour rings now here now there he turns on every side and wind his course before the following tide the wave flow after
he like the warlike eagle speeds his pace swiftest and strongest of the aerial race wheresoe er he wheels and gather fast and murmur at his heels
so when a peasant to his garden brings soft rills of water from the bubbling spring and calls the flood from high to bless his bowers and feed with pregnant stream the plants and flowers
and marks the future current with his spade swift er the rolling pebbles down the hill louder and louder purl the falling rills before him scattering they prevent his pain and shine in mazy wanderings er the plain
soon as he clears whate er their passage stay still fly achilles but before his eye still swift scamander rolls where er he fly not all his speed escapes the rapid flood the first of man but not a match for god
oft as he turn the torrent to oppose and bravely try if all the power were foe so oft the surge in watery mountain spread beats on his back or bursts upon his head
tired by the tide his knees relax with toil wash from beneath him slides the slimy soil when thus his eye on heaven expansion thrown
yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves and still indignant bounds above the wave forth bursts the hero with an angry groan
is there no god achilles to befriend no power to avert his miserable end prevent which_jove this ignominious date and make my future life the sport of fate
of all heaven oracles believed in vain but most of thetis must her son complain by phoebus dart she prophesied my fall
in glorious arm before the trojan wall oh had i died in field of battle warm stretch like a hero by a hero arm
might stern_hector spear this dauntless bosom rend and my swift soul ertake my slaughter friend ah no achilles meets a shameful fate
like some vile swain whom on a rainy day crossing a ford the torrent sweeps away an unregarded carcase to the sea
oh how unworthy of the brave and great neptune and pallas haste to his relief and thus in human form address the chief
the power of ocean first forbear thy fear son of peleus lo thy god appear behold from which_jove descending to thy aid propitious neptune and the blue eyed maid
stay and the furious flood shall cease to rave tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave but thou the counsel heaven suggests attend
nor breathe from combat nor thy sword suspend till troy receive her flying son till all her routed squadrons pant behind their wall stern_hector alone shall stand his fatal chance and stern_hector blood shall smoke upon thy lance
thine is the glory doom thus spake the god then swift ascended to the bright abodes stung with new ardour thus by heaven impell d
he spring impetuous and invades the field er all the expanded plain the water spread heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead floating midst scatter arm while casques of gold and turn up bucklers glitter as they roll
high er the surging tide by leaps and bounds he wades and mounts the parted wave resounds not a whole river stops the hero course while pallas fills him with immortal force
haste my brother flood and check this mortal that controls a god our bravest hero else shall quit the fight and ilion tumble from her towery height
call then thy subject stream and bid them roar from all thy fountains swell thy watery store with broken rock and with a load of dead charge the black surge and pour it on his head
with equal rage indignant xanthus roars and lifts his billows and erwhelms his shore then thus to simois mark how resistless through the flood he goes and boldly bids the warring god be foe
but nor that force nor form divine to sight shall aught avail him if our rage unite whelm under our dark gulfs those arm shall lie
that blaze so dreadful in each trojan eye and deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl immersed remain this terror of the world
such ponderous ruin shall confound the place no greeks shall er his perish relics grace no hand his bones shall gather or inhume these his cold rite and this his watery tomb
illustration achilles contending with the rivers achilles contending with the rivers he said and on the chief descends amain increased with gore and swelling with the slain
a foam whitens on the purple wave at every step before achilles stood the crimson surge and deluged him with blood
then murmuring from his bed he boils he raves and fear touch the queen of heaven she saw dismay she call aloud and summon vulcan aid
while to their aid by our command enjoin rush the swift eastern and the western wind these from old ocean at my word shall blow
pour the red torrent on the watery foe corses and arm to one bright ruin turn and hissing rivers to their bottoms burn
rise to the war the insulting flood requires thy wasteful arm assemble all thy fire go mighty in thy rage
display thy power drink the whole flood the crackling trees devour scorch all the banks and till our voice reclaim exert the unwearied fury of the flame
the power ignipotent her word obeys wide er the plain he pours the boundless blaze at once consumes the dead and dries the soil
and the shrunk water in their channel boil as when autumnal boreas sweeps the sky and instant blow the water gardens dry
swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin prey along the margin wind the running blaze the trees in flaming rows to ashes turn the flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn broad elm and cypress rising in a spire the watery willows hiss before the fire
so look the field so whiten was the ground while vulcan breathed the fiery blast around now glow the wave the fishes pant for breath the eels lie twisting in the pangs of death
now flounce aloft now dive the scaly fry or gasping turn their bellies to the sky at length the river rear d
his languid head and thus short panting to the god he said oh vulcan oh what power resists thy might i faint i sink unequal to the fight i yield
let ilion fall if fate decree ah bend no more thy fiery arm on me he ceased wide conflagration blazing round the bubbling water yield a hissing sound
as when the flame beneath a cauldron rise to melt the fat of some rich sacrifice amid the fierce embrace of circling fire
the water foam the heavy smoke aspires so boils the imprison flood forbid to flow and choked with vapours feels his bottom glow
to juno then imperial queen of air the burning river sends his earnest prayer ah why saturnia must thy son engage me only me with all his wasteful rage
on other god his dreadful arm employ for mightier god assert the cause of troy submissive i desist if thou command
hear then my solemn oath to yield to fate unaided ilion and her destined state till greece shall gird her with destructive flame
but ah withdraw this all destroying hand and in one ruin sink the trojan name his warm entreaty touch saturnia ear
she bade the ignipotent his rage forbear recall the flame nor in a mortal cause infest a god the obedient flame withdraws again the branching stream begin to spread and soft remurmur in their wonted bed
while these by juno will the strife resign the warring god in fierce contention join rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarm
with horrid clangour shock the ethereal arm heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound and wide beneath them groans the rending ground
the power of battle lifts his brazen spear and first assaults the radiant queen of war what moved thy madness thus to disunite ethereal mind and mix all heaven in fight
which_jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries and view contending god with careless eye what wonder this when in thy frantic mood
thou drovest a mortal to insult a god thy impious hand tydides javelin bore and madly bathed it in celestial gore
he spoke and smote the long resounding shield which bears which_jove thunder on its dreadful field the adamantine aegis of her sire
a stone the limit of the neighbouring land there fix from eldest time black craggy vast this at the heavenly homicide she cast
that turns the glancing bolt and forked fire then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand thundering he fall a mass of monstrous size and seven broad acres covers as he lies
the stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound loud er the field his ringing arm resound the scornful dame her conquest view with smiles and glorying thus the prostrate god reviles
juno whom thou rebellious darest withstand corrects thy folly thus by pallas hand thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace and partial aid to troy perfidious race
hast thou not yet insatiate fury known how far minerva force transcends thy own the goddess spoke and turn her eye away that beaming round diffused celestial day
which_jove cyprian daughter stooping on the land lent to the wounded god her tender hand slowly he rises scarcely breathes with pain and propp on her fair arm forsakes the plain
this the bright empress of the heaven survey and scoffing thus to war victorious maid lo what an aid on mars side is seen
the smiles and love unconquerable queen mark with what insolence in open view she moves let pallas if she dares pursue
minerva smiling heard the pair ertook and slightly on her breast the wanton strook she unresisting fell her spirit fled on earth together lay the lovers spread
to grecian god such let the phrygian be so dread so fierce as venus is to me then from the lowest stone shall troy be moved
and like these hero be the fate of all minerva cry who guard the trojan wall thus she and juno with a smile approved
what sloth has seized us when the field around ring with conflicting power and heaven return the sound shall ignominious we with shame retire no deed perform to our olympian sire
meantime to mix in more than mortal fight the god of ocean dares the god of light come prove thy arm
for first the war to wage suits not my greatness or superior age rash as thou art to prop the trojan throne
forgetful of my wrongs and of thy own and guard the race of proud laomedon hast thou forgot how at the monarch prayer we shared the lengthen labour of a year
troy wall i raised for such were which_jove command and yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hand thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves along fair ida vales and pendant groves
but when the circling seasons in their train brought back the grateful day that crown our pain with menace stern_hector the fraudful king defied our latent godhead and the prize denied mad as he was he threaten servile band and doom us exiles far in barbarous land
dost thou for this afford proud ilion grace and not like us infest the faithless race like us their present future son destroy and from its deep foundations heave their troy
incensed we heavenward fled with swiftest wing and destined vengeance on the perjured king apollo thus to combat for mankind ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind for what is man
calamitous by birth they owe their life and nourishment to earth like yearly leaves that now with beauty crown smile on the sun now wither on the ground
then turns his face far beaming heavenly fire and from the senior power submiss retires him thus retreating artemis upbraids the quiver huntress of the sylvan shade and is it thus the youthful phoebus fly and yields to ocean hoary sire the prize
to their own hand commit the frantic scene nor mix immortals in a cause so mean how vain that martial pomp and dreadful show of pointed arrow and the silver bow
now boast no more in yon celestial bower thy force can match the great earth shaking power silent he heard the queen of wood upbraid not so saturnia bore the vaunting maid
but furious thus what insolence has driven thy pride to face the majesty of heaven what though by which_jove the female plague design
fierce to the feeble race of womankind the wretched matron feels thy piercing dart thy sex tyrant with a tiger heart
what though tremendous in the woodland chase thy certain arrow pierce the savage race how dares thy rashness on the power divine employ those arm or match thy force with mine
she said and seized her wrists with eager rage these in her left hand lock her right untied the bow the quiver and its plumy pride
learn hence no more unequal war to wage about her temples fly the busy bow now here now there she wind her from the blow
the scattering arrow rattling from the case drop round and idly mark the dusty place swift from the field the baffled huntress fly and scarce restrains the torrent in her eye
so when the falcon wing her way above to the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove not fated yet to die there safe retreats yet still her heart against the marble beats
to her latona hastes with tender care whom hermes viewing thus declines the war how shall i face the dame who gives delight to him whose thunder blacken heaven with night
he spoke and pass latona stooping low collects the scatter shafts and fallen bow that glittering on the dust lay here and there dishonour relics of diana war
then swift pursued her to her blest abode where all confused she sought the sovereign god weeping she grasp his knees the ambrosial vest shook with her sighs and panted on her breast
go matchless goddess triumph in the sky and boast my conquest while i yield the prize the sire superior smiled and bade her show
what heavenly hand had caused his daughter woe abash she name his own imperial spouse and the pale crescent fades upon her brows
thus they above while swiftly gliding down apollo enters ilion sacred town the guardian god now trembled for her wall and fear the greeks though fate forbade her fall
back to olympus from the war alarm return the shining band of god in arm some proud in triumph some with rage on fire and take their throne around the ethereal sire
as when avenging flame with fury driven on guilty town exert the wrath of heaven the pale inhabitants some fall some fly and the red vapours purple all the sky so raged achilles death and dire dismay and toil and terror fill the dreadful day
high on a turret hoary priam stands and marks the waste of his destructive hand view from his arm the trojans scatter flight and the near hero rising on his sight
with feeble pace and settled sorrow on his aged face fast as he could he sighing quits the wall and thus descending on the guards he calls you to whose care our city gate belong set wide your portals to the flying throng
through blood through death achilles still proceeds er slaughter hero and er rolling steed no stop no check no aid for lo
he comes with unresisted sway he comes and desolation marks his way but when within the wall our troop take breath lock fast the brazen bars and shut out death
rush forth the flying band to meet struck slaughter back and cover the retreat on heap the trojans crowd to gain the gate and gladsome see their last escape from fate
thither all parch with thirst a heartless train hoary with dust they beat the hollow plain and gasping panting fainting labour on with heavier strides that lengthen toward the town
thus charged the reverend monarch wide were flung the opening folds the sounding hinges rung phoebus enraged achilles follows with his spear
then had the greeks eternal praise acquired and troy inglorious to her wall retired but he the god who dart ethereal flame shot down to save her and redeem her fame
wild with revenge insatiable of war to young agenor force divine he gave antenor offspring haughty bold and brave in aid of him beside the beech he sate and wrapt in cloud restrain the hand of fate
when now the generous youth achilles spies thick beats his heart the troubled motions rise so ere a storm the water heave and roll
he stops and questions thus his mighty soul what shall i fly this terror of the plain like other fly and be like other slain
vain hope to shun him by the self same road yon line of slaughter trojans lately trod no with the common heap i scorn to fall
what if they pass me to the trojan wall while i decline to yonder path that leads to ida forests and surrounding shade
so may i reach conceal the cooling flood from my tired body wash the dirt and blood as soon as night her dusky veil extends
return in safety to my trojan friend what if but wherefore all this vain debate stand i to doubt within the reach of fate
the fierce achilles sees me and i fall such is his swiftness tis in vain to fly and such his valour that who stands must die
even now perhaps ere yet i turn the wall howe er tis better fighting for the state here and in public view to meet my fate
yet sure he too is mortal he may feel like all the son of earth the force of steel one only soul informs that dreadful frame
and which_jove sole favour gives him all his fame he said and stood collected in his might and all his beating bosom claim the fight
so from some deep grown wood a panther starts roused from his thicket by a storm of dart untaught to fear or fly he hears the sound of shouting hunters and of clamorous hounds though struck though wounded scarce perceives the pain and the barb javelin stings his breast in vain
not less resolved antenor valiant heir confronts achilles and awaits the war disdainful of retreat high held before his shield a broad circumference he bore then graceful as he stood in act to throw the lifted javelin thus bespoke the foe
on their whole war untamed the savage fly and tear his hunter or beneath him dies how proud achilles glory in his fame
and hope this day to sink the trojan name beneath her ruin know that hope is vain a thousand woe a thousand toil remain
parent and children our just arm employ and strong and many are the son of troy great as thou art even thou may st stain with gore
he said with matchless force the javelin flung smote on his knee the hollow cuishes rung beneath the pointed steel but safe from harms he stands impassive in the ethereal arm
these phrygian field and press a foreign shore then fiercely rushing on the daring foe his lifted arm prepares the fatal blow
but jealous of his fame apollo shrouds the god like trojan in a veil of cloud safe from pursuit and shut from mortal view dismiss with fame the favoured youth withdrew
meanwhile the god to cover their escape assumes agenor habit voice and shape fly from the furious chief in this disguise the furious chief still follows where he fly
now er the field they stretch with lengthen strides now urge the course where swift scamander glides the god now distant scarce a stride before
tempts his pursuit and wheels about the shore while all the flying troop their speed employ and pour on heap into the wall of troy
no stop no stay no thought to ask or tell who scaped by flight or who by battle fell twas tumult all and violence of flight and sudden joy confused and mix affright
pale troy against achilles shuts her gate and nation breathe deliver from their fate book xxii argument the death of stern_hector
the trojans being safe within the wall stern_hector only stays to oppose achilles priam is struck at his approach and tries to persuade his son to re enter the town
stern_hector consults within himself what measures to take but at the advance of achilles his resolution fails him and he fly
hecuba joins her entreaties but in vain achilles pursues him thrice round the wall of troy the god debate concerning the fate of stern_hector at length minerva descends to the aid of achilles
she deludes stern_hector in the shape of deiphobus he stands the combat and is slain achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of priam and hecuba
their cry reach the ear of andromache who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of the palace she mounts up to the wall and beholds her dead husband
their lamentations tear and despair she swoons at the spectacle her excess of grief and lamentation the thirtieth day still continues
the scene lies under the wall and on the battlements of troy thus to their bulwarks smit with panic fear the herded ilians rush like driven deer
close to the wall advancing er the field beneath one roof of well compacted shield march bending on the greeks embodied power far stretching in the shade of trojan tower
great stern_hector singly stay chain down by fate there fix he stood before the scaean gate still his bold arm determined to employ
there safe they wipe the briny drops away and drown in bowls the labour of the day the guardian still of long defended troy
apollo now to tired achilles turns the power confess in all his glory burns and what he cry has peleus son in view with mortal speed a godhead to pursue
for not to thee to know the god is given unskill to trace the latent marks of heaven what boots thee now that troy forsook the plain
vain thy past labour and thy present vain safe in their wall are now her troop bestow while here thy frantic rage attacks a god
the chief incensed too partial god of day to check my conquest in the middle way how few in ilion else had refuge found
what gasping number now had bit the ground thou robb st me of a glory justly mine powerful of godhead and of fraud divine
mean fame alas for one of heavenly strain to cheat a mortal who repines in vain then to the city terrible and strong with high and haughty steps he tower along
so the proud courser victor of the prize to the near goal with double ardour fly him as he blazing shot across the field the careful eye of priam first beheld
through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night orion dog the year when autumn weighs and er the feebler stars exerts his rays
not half so dreadful rises to the sight terrific glory for his burning breath taints the red air with fevers plagues and death
then wept the sage he strikes his reverend head now white with age he lifts his wither arm obtests the sky he calls his much loved son with feeble cry the son resolved achilles force to dare full at the scaean gate expects the war while the sad father on the rampart stands and thus adjures him with extended hand ah stay not stay not
so flamed his fiery mail guardless and alone stern_hector my loved my dearest bravest son methinks already i behold thee slain and stretch beneath that fury of the plain
implacable achilles might st thou be to all the god no dearer than to me thee vultures wild should scatter round the shore
and bloody dog grow fiercer from thy gore how many valiant son i late enjoy valiant in vain by thy cursed arm destroy d
two while i speak my eye in vain explore two from one mother sprung my polydore and loved lycaon now perhaps no more
or worse than slaughtered sold in distant isles to shameful bondage and unworthy toil oh if in yonder hostile camp they live what heap of gold what treasures would i give
but if which heaven forbid already lost all pale they wander on the stygian coast what sorrow then must their sad mother know what anguish
their grandsire wealth by right of birth their own consign his daughter with lelegia throne i unutterable woe yet less that anguish less to her to me less to all troy if not deprived of thee
yet shun achilles enter yet the wall and spare thyself thy father spare us all save thy dear life or if a soul so brave neglect that thought thy dearer glory save
pity while yet i live these silver hair while yet thy father feels the woe he bears yet cursed with sense
a wretch whom in his rage all trembling on the verge of helpless age great which_jove has placed sad spectacle of pain
the bitter dregs of fortune cup to drain to fill with scene of death his closing eye and number all his day by miseries
my hero slain my bridal bed erturn my daughter ravish and my city burn my bleeding infant dash against the floor these i have yet to see perhaps yet more
perhaps even i reserved by angry fate the last sad relic of my ruin state dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness must fall and stain the pavement of my regal hall where famish dog late guardians of my door shall lick their mangled master spatter gore
yet for my son i thank ye god tis well well have they perish for in fight they fell
but when the fate in fulness of their rage spurn the hoar head of unresisting age in dust the reverend lineaments deform and pour to dog the life blood scarcely warm this this is misery
who dies in youth and vigour dies the best struck through with wound all honest on the breast the last the worse that man can feel
man fated to be cursed he said and acting what no word could say rent from his head the silver locks away
the zone unbraced her bosom she display and thus fast falling the salt tear she said have mercy on me my son
with him the mournful mother bears a part yet all her sorrow turn not stern_hector heart revere the word of age attend a parent prayer
if ever thee in these fond arm i press or still thy infant clamours at this breast ah do not thus our helpless year forego
but by our wall secured repel the foe against his rage if singly thou proceed should st thou but heaven avert it
should st thou bleed nor must thy corse lie honour on the bier nor spouse nor mother grace thee with a tear
so they while down their cheeks the torrents roll but fix remains the purpose of his soul resolved he stands and with a fiery glance expects the hero terrible advance
far from our pious rite those dear remains must feast the vultures on the naked plain so roll up in his den the swelling snake beholds the traveller approach the brake when fed with noxious herbs
his turgid veins have gather half the poisons of the plain he burns he stiffens with collected ire and his red eyeballs glare with living fire
beneath a turret on his shield reclined he stood and question thus his mighty mind where lies my way to enter in the wall
honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall shall proud polydamas before the gate proclaim his counsel are obey too late which timely
follow but the former night what number had been saved by stern_hector flight that wise_nestor advice rejected with disdain i feel my folly in my people slain
methinks my suffering country voice i hear but most her worthless son insult my ear on my rash courage charge the chance of war and blame those virtues which they cannot share
no if i er return return i must glorious my country terror laid in dust or if i perish let her see me fall in field at least and fighting for her wall
and yet suppose these measures i forego approach unarm and parley with the foe the warrior shield the helm and lance lay down
and treat on terms of peace to save the town the wife withheld the treasure ill detain cause of the war and grievance of the land
with honourable justice to restore and add half ilion yet remaining store which troy shall sworn produce that injured greece may share our wealth and leave our wall in peace
but why this thought unarm if i should go what hope of mercy from this vengeful foe but woman like to fall and fall without a blow
we greet not here as man conversing man met at an oak or journeying er a plain no season now for calm familiar talk like youth and maidens in an evening walk
thus pondering like a god the greek drew nigh his dreadful plumage nodded from on high the pelian javelin in his better hand shot trembling rays that glitter d
war is our business but to whom is given to die or triumph that determine heaven er the land and on his breast the beamy splendour shone like which_jove own lightning or the rising sun
as stern_hector sees unusual terror rise struck by some god he fear recedes and fly he leaves the gate he leaves the wall behind achilles follows like the winged wind
thus at the panting dove a falcon fly the swiftest racer of the liquid sky just when he holds or thinks he holds his prey obliquely wheeling through the aerial way with open beak and shrilling cry he spring and aims his claws and shoots upon his wing no less fore right the rapid chase they held one urged by fury one by fear impell
now circling round the wall their course maintain where the high watch tower overlooks the plain now where the fig trees spread their umbrage broad a wider compass smoke along the road
next by scamander double source they bound where two famed fountains burst the parted ground this hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise with exhalations steaming to the sky that the green banks in summer heat erflows like crystal clear and cold as winter snows each gushing fount a marble cistern fills whose polish bed receives the falling rills where trojan dame ere yet alarm by greece wash their fair garments in the day of peace
swift was the course no vulgar prize they play no vulgar victim must reward the day such as in race crown the speedy strife
by these they pass one chasing one in flight the mighty fled pursued by stronger might the prize contended was great stern_hector life
as when some hero funerals are decreed in grateful honour of the mighty dead where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame some golden tripod or some lovely dame
the panting courser swiftly turn the goal and with them turns the raised spectator soul thus three time round the trojan wall they fly
the gazing god lean forward from the sky to whom while eager on the chase they look the sire of mortal and immortals spoke
stern_hector whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain whose grateful fumes the god received with joy from ida summits and the tower of troy now see him flying to his fear resign and fate and fierce achilles close behind
unworthy sight the man beloved of heaven behold inglorious round yon city driven my heart partakes the generous stern_hector pain consult ye power
tis worthy your debate whether to snatch him from impending fate or let him bear by stern_hector pelides slain good as he is the lot imposed on man
then pallas thus shall he whose vengeance form the forky bolt and blackens heaven with storm shall he prolong one trojan forfeit breath
a man a mortal pre ordain to death and will no murmurs fill the courts above no god indignant blame their partial which_jove
go then return the sire without delay exert thy will i give the fate their way swift at the mandate pleased tritonia fly and stoops impetuous from the cleaving sky
as through the forest er the vale and lawn the well breath beagle drives the flying fawn in vain he tries the covert of the brakes or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes sure of the vapour in the tainted dews the certain hound his various maze pursues
thus step by step where er the trojan wheel there swift achilles compass round the field oft as to reach the dardan gate he bends
and hope the assistance of his pitying friend whose showering arrow as he coursed below from the high turrets might oppress the foe
as man in slumbers seem with speedy pace one to pursue and one to lead the chase their sinking limb the fancied course forsake nor this can fly nor that can overtake no less the labouring hero pant and strain
so oft achilles turns him to the plain he eye the city but he eye in vain while that but fly and this pursues in vain
phoebus it was who in his latest hour endued his knees with strength his nerves with power and great achilles lest some greek advance should snatch the glory from his lifted lance sign to the troop to yield his foe the way and leave untouch the honour of the day
which_jove lifts the golden balances that show the fate of mortal man and things below here each contending hero lot he tries and weighs with equal hand their destinies
what god muse assisted stern_hector force with fate itself so long to hold the course low sinks the scale surcharged with stern_hector fate heavy with death it sinks and hell receives the weight
then phoebus left him fierce minerva fly to stern_hector pelides and triumphing cry loved of which_jove this day our labour cease and conquest blaze with full beams on greece
great stern_hector fall that stern_hector famed so far drunk with renown insatiable of war fall by thy hand and mine nor force nor flight shall more avail him nor his god of light
see where in vain he supplicates above roll at the foot of unrelenting which_jove rest here myself will lead the trojan on and urge to meet the fate he cannot shun
while like deiphobus the martial dame her face her gesture and her arm the same in show an aid by hapless stern_hector side
her voice divine the chief with joyful mind obey and rested on his lance reclined approach and greets him thus with voice
too long stern_hector have i borne the sight of this distress and sorrow in thy flight it fits us now a noble stand to make and here as brother equal fate partake
allied in blood and fame dearer than all that own a brother name of all that hecuba to priam bore long tried long loved much loved but honoured more
belied then he prince since you of all our numerous race alone defend my life regardless of your own
again the goddess much my father prayer and much my mother press me to forbear my friend embraced my knees adjured my stay but stronger love impell and i obey
let the steel sparkle and the javelin fly or let us stretch achilles on the field or to his arm our bloody trophies yield
come then the glorious conflict let us try fraudful she said then swiftly march before the dardan hero shuns his foe no more
sternly they met the silence stern_hector broke his dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke enough son of peleus troy has view d
her wall thrice circled and her chief pursued but now some god within me bids me try thine or my fate
and for a moment space suspend the day let heaven high power be call to arbitrate the just conditions of this stern_hector debate eternal witnesses of all below and faithful guardians of the treasured vow
to them i swear if victor in the strife which_jove by these hand shall shed thy noble life no vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue stripp of its arm alone the conqueror due
i kill thee or i die yet on the verge of battle let us stay the rest to greece uninjured i ll restore
talk not of oaths the dreadful chief replies while anger flash from his disdainful eye detested as thou art and ought to be nor oath nor pact achilles plights with thee such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine such leagues as man and furious lion join to such i call the god
now plight thy mutual oath i ask no more one constant state of lasting rancour and eternal hate no thought but rage and never ceasing strife
till death extinguish rage and thought and life rouse then thy force this important hour collect thy soul and call forth all thy power
no further subterfuge no further chance tis pallas pallas gives thee to my lance each grecian ghost by thee deprived of breath
now hovers round and calls thee to thy death he spoke and launch his javelin at the foe but stern_hector shunn d
the meditated blow he stoop while er his head the flying spear sang innocent and spent its force in air minerva watch d
it falling on the land then drew and gave to great achilles hand unseen of stern_hector who elate with joy now shakes his lance and braves the dread of troy
my fate depends on heaven to thee presumptuous as thou art unknown or what must prove my fortune or thy own
the life you boasted to that javelin given prince you have miss boasting is but an art our fear to blind
and with false terror sink another mind but know whatever fate i am to try by no dishonest wound shall stern_hector die
i shall not fall a fugitive at least my soul shall bravely issue from my breast but first try thou my arm and may this dart end all my country woe deep buried in thy heart
the weapon flew its course unerring held unerring but the heavenly shield repell the mortal dart resulting with a bound from off the ringing orb it struck the ground
stern_hector beheld his javelin fall in vain nor other lance nor other hope remain he calls deiphobus demands a spear in vain for no deiphobus was there
all comfortless he stands then with a sigh tis so heaven wills it and my hour is nigh i deem deiphobus had heard my call but he secure lies guarded in the wall
a god deceived me pallas twas thy deed death and black fate approach tis i must bleed no refuge now no succour from above great which_jove deserts me and the son of which_jove propitious once and kind
then welcome fate tis true i perish yet i perish great yet in a mighty deed i shall expire let future age hear it and admire
fierce at the word his weighty sword he drew and all collected on achilles flew so which_jove bold bird high balanced in the air stoops from the cloud to truss the quivering hare
nor less achilles his fierce soul prepares before his breast the flaming shield he bears refulgent orb above his fourfold cone
the gilded horse hair sparkled in the sun nodding at every step vulcanian frame and as he moved his figure seem on flame
as radiant hesper shines with keener light far beaming er the silver host of night when all the starry train emblaze the sphere
in his right hand he wave the weapon round eye the whole man and meditates the wound but the rich mail patroclus lately wore securely cased the warrior body er
so shone the point of great achilles spear one space at length he spies to let in fate where twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
gave entrance through that penetrable part furious he drove the well directed dart nor pierced the windpipe yet nor took the power of speech unhappy from thy dying hour
prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies while thus triumphing stern_hector achilles cry at last is stern_hector stretch upon the plain
who fear no vengeance for patroclus slain then prince you should have fear what now you feel achilles absent was achilles still
yet a short space the great avenger stayed then low in dust thy strength and glory laid peaceful he sleeps with all our rite adorn for ever honour and for ever
mourn while cast to all the rage of hostile power thee birds shall mangle and the god devour then stern_hector fainting at the approach of death by thy own soul
by those who gave thee breath by all the sacred prevalence of prayer ah leave me not for grecian dog to tear
the common rite of sepulture bestow to soothe a father and a mother woe let their large gift procure an urn at least and stern_hector ashes in his country rest
no wretch accursed relentless he replies flame as he spoke shot flashing from his eye not those who gave me breath should bid me spare nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer
could i myself the bloody banquet join no to the dog that carcase i resign should troy to bribe me bring forth all her store and giving thousands offer thousands more
should dardan priam and his weeping dame drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame their stern_hector on the pile they should not see nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee
then thus the chief his dying accents drew thy rage implacable too well i knew the fury that relentless breast have steel and cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield
yet think a day will come when fate decree and angry god shall wreak this wrong on thee phoebus and paris shall avenge my fate and stretch thee here before the scaean gate
his labouring breath and his eye stiffen at the hand of death to the dark realm the spirit wing its way
he ceased the fate suppress the manly body left a load of clay and plaintive glides along the dreary coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost
achilles musing as he roll his eye er the dead hero thus unheard replies die thou the first when which_jove and heaven ordain i follow thee he said and stripp the slain
then forcing backward from the gaping wound the reeking javelin cast it on the ground the thronging greeks behold with wondering eye
his manly beauty and superior size while some ignobler the great dead deface with wound ungenerous or with taunts disgrace how changed that stern_hector who like which_jove of late sent lightning on our fleet and scatter fate
high er the slain the great achilles stands begirt with hero and surrounding band and thus aloud while all the host attends prince and leader
countrymen and friend since now at length the powerful will of heaven the dire destroyer to our arm has given is not troy fallen already
see if already their deserted tower are left unmann or if they yet retain the soul of hero their great stern_hector slain
haste ye power but what is troy or glory what to me or why reflects my mind on aught but thee divine patroclus
death hath seal his eye unwept unhonour uninterr he lies can his dear image from my soul depart long as the vital spirit moves my heart
if in the melancholy shade below the flame of friend and lovers cease to glow yet mine shall sacred last mine undecay burn on through death and animate my shade
meanwhile ye son of greece in triumph bring the corpse of stern_hector and your paeans sing be this the song slow moving toward the shore stern_hector is dead and ilion is no more
the nervous ancles bored his foot he bound with thongs inserted through the double wound these fix up high behind the rolling wain his graceful head was trail along the plain
then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred unworthy of himself and of the dead proud on his car the insulting victor stood and bore aloft his arm distilling blood
now lost is all that formidable air the face divine and long descending hair purple the ground and streak the sable sand deform dishonour in his native land
he smites the steed the rapid chariot fly the sudden cloud of circling dust arise given to the rage of an insulting throng
the mother first beheld with sad survey she rent her tresses venerable grey and cast far off the regal veils away
with piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans while the sad father answers groans with groans tear after tear his mournful cheeks erflow and the whole city wears one face of woe no less than if the rage of hostile fire
from her foundations curling to her spires er the proud citadel at length should rise and the last blaze send ilion to the sky
and in his parent sight now dragg along the wretched monarch of the falling state distracted presses to the dardan gate
scarce the whole people stop his desperate course while strong affliction gives the feeble force grief tear his heart and drives him to and fro
in all the raging impotence of woe at length he roll in dust and thus begun imploring all and naming one by one
ah let me let me go where sorrow calls i only i will issue from your wall guide or companion friend
i ask ye none and bow before the murderer of my son my grief perhaps his pity may engage perhaps at least he may respect my age
a man like me one not exempt from age and misery vigorous no more as when his young embrace begot this pest of me and all my race
he has a father too how many valiant son in early bloom has that cursed hand send headlong to the tomb
o had thy gentle spirit pass in peace the son expiring in the sire embrace while both thy parent wept the fatal hour and bending er thee mix the tender shower
thee stern_hector last thy loss divinely brave sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave some comfort that had been some sad relief to melt in full satiety of grief
thus wail the father grovelling on the ground and all the eye of ilion stream around amidst her matrons hecuba appears a mourning princess and a train in tear
ah why has heaven prolong this hated breath patient of horror to behold thy death stern_hector late thy parent pride and joy the boast of nation
the defence of troy to whom her safety and her fame she owed her chief her hero and almost her god
but not as yet the fatal news had spread to fair andromache of stern_hector dead as yet no messenger had told his fate not en his stay without the scaean gate
o fatal change become in one sad day a senseless corse inanimated clay far in the close recesses of the dome pensive she plied the melancholy loom
a growing work employ her secret hour confusedly gay with intermingled flowers her fair haired handmaids heat the brazen urn the bath preparing for her lord return in vain alas
her lord return no more unbathed he lies and bleeds along the shore now from the wall the clamours reach her ear and all her members shake with sudden fear
forth from her ivory hand the shuttle fall and thus astonish to her maid she calls illustration the bath the bath
my faltering knees their trembling frame desert a pulse unusual flutters at my heart some strange disaster some reverse of fate ye god avert it
ah follow me she cried what plaintive noise invades my ear tis sure my mother voice threats the trojan state
far be the omen which my thought suggest but much i fear my stern_hector dauntless breast confronts achilles chased along the plain shut from our wall
and sought for glory in the jaws of fate perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath now quench for ever in the arm of death
she spoke and furious with distracted pace fear in her heart and anguish in her face fly through the dome the maid her steps pursue and mounts the wall and sends around her view
i fear i fear him slain safe in the crowd he ever scorn to wait too soon her eye the killing object found
the godlike stern_hector dragg along the ground a sudden darkness shade her swimming eye she faints she fall her breath her colour fly
her hair fair ornaments the braids that bound the net that held them and the wreath that crown the veil and diadem flew far away the gift of venus on her bridal day
around a train of weeping sisters stands to raise her sinking with assistant hand scarce from the verge of death recall again she faints or but recovers to complain
illustration andromache fainting on the wall andromache fainting on the wall wretched husband of a wretched wife born with one fate to one unhappy life
for sure one star its baneful beam display on priam roof and hippoplacia shade from different parent different climes we came
at different periods yet our fate the same why was my birth to great aetion owed and why was all that tender care
bestow would i had never been thou the ghost of my dead husband miserably lost thou to the dismal realm for ever gone
and i abandon desolate alone an only child once comfort of my pain sad product now of hapless love remains no more to smile upon his sire no friend to help him now
no father to defend for should he scape the sword the common doom what wrongs attend him and what grief to come
the day that to the shade the father sends robs the sad orphan of his father friend he wretched outcast of mankind appears for ever sad for ever bathed in tear amongst the happy unregarded he hangs on the robe or trembles at the knee while those his father former bounty fed nor reach the goblet nor divide the bread the kindest but his present wants allay
even from his own paternal roof expell some stranger ploughs his patrimonial field to leave him wretched the succeeding day frugal compassion
heedless they who boast both parent still nor feel what he has lost shall cry begone thy father feasts not here
the wretch obeys retiring with a tear thus wretched thus retiring all in tear to my sad soul astyanax appears forced by repeated insults to return and to his widow mother vainly mourn
he who with tender delicacy bred with prince sported and on dainties fed and when still evening gave him up to rest sunk soft in down upon the nurse breast must ah what must he not
whom ilion calls astyanax from her well guarded wall is now that name no more unhappy boy since now no more thy father guards his troy
but thou my stern_hector liest exposed in air far from thy parent and thy consort care whose hand in vain directed by her love the martial scarf and robe of triumph wove
now to devouring flame be these a prey useless to thee from this accursed day yet let the sacrifice at least be paid an honour to the living not the dead
so spake the mournful dame her matrons hear sigh back her sighs and answer tear with tear book xxiii argument funeral games in honour of patroclus
after the funeral feast he retires to the sea shore where falling asleep the ghost of his friend appears to him and demands the rite of burial the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre
achilles and the myrmidons do honour to the body of patroclus the funeral procession and the offering their hair to the dead
achilles sacrifices several animals and lastly twelve trojan captives at the pile then sets fire to it he pays libations to the wind which at the instance of iris rise and raise the flame
when the pile has burned all night they gather the bones place them in an urn of gold and raise the tomb
achilles institutes the funeral games the chariot race the fight of the caestus the wrestling the foot race the single combat the discus the shooting with arrow the darting the javelin the various descriptions of which and the various success of the several antagonists make the greatest part of the book
the night following the ghost of patroclus appears to achilles the one and thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile the two and thirtieth in burning it and the three and thirtieth in the games
in this book ends the thirtieth day the scene is generally on the sea shore thus humbled in the dust the pensive train through the sad city
the grecians seek their ship and clear the strand all but the martial myrmidonian band these yet assembled great achilles holds and the stern_hector purpose of his mind unfolds not yet my brave companions of the war release your smoking courser from the car
mourn her hero slain the body soil with dust and black with gore lies on broad hellespont resounding shore but with his chariot each in order led perform due honour to patroclus dead
ere yet from rest or food we seek relief some rite remain to glut our rage of grief the troop obey and thrice in order led
achilles first their courser round the dead and thrice their sorrow and laments renew tear bathe their arm and tear the sands bedew
but chief pelides thick succeeding sighs burst from his heart and torrents from his eye his slaughtering hand yet red with blood he laid on his dead friend cold breast and thus he said
for such a warrior thetis aid their woe melts their strong heart and bids their eye to flow all hail patroclus let thy honour ghost hear and rejoice on pluto dreary coast behold
to the dog his carcase i resign and twelve sad victim of the trojan line sacred to vengeance instant shall expire their life effused around thy funeral pyre
achilles promise is complete the bloody stern_hector stretch before thy foot lo gloomy he said and horrible to view before the bier the bleeding stern_hector threw prone on the dust
the myrmidons around unbraced their armour and the steed unbound all to achilles sable ship repair frequent and full the genial feast to share
now from the well fed swine black smokes aspire the bristly victim hissing er the fire the huge ox bellowing fall with feebler cry expires the goat the sheep in silence dies
around the hero prostrate body flow in one promiscuous stream the reeking blood and now a band of argive monarch brings the glorious victor to the king of king
the attending herald as by office bound with kindled flame the tripod vase surround to cleanse his conquering hand from hostile gore they urged in vain the chief refused and swore
from his dead friend the pensive warrior went with steps unwilling to the regal tent no drop shall touch me by almighty which_jove
the first and greatest of the god above till on the pyre i place thee till i rear the grassy mound and clip thy sacred hair
howe er reluctant as i am i stay and share your feast but with the dawn of day king of man
it claims thy royal care that greece the warrior funeral pile prepare and bid the forests fall such rite are paid to hero slumbering in eternal shade
some ease at least those pious rite may give and soothe my sorrow while i bear to live then when his earthly part shall mount in fire let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire
he spoke they hear him and the word obey the rage of hunger and of thirst allay then ease in sleep the labour of the day
but great pelides stretch along the shore where dash on rock the broken billows roar lies inly groaning while on either hand the martial myrmidons confusedly stand
tired with his chase around the trojan wall hush by the murmurs of the rolling deep at length he sinks in the soft arm of sleep
along the grass his languid members fall when lo the shade before his closing eye of sad patroclus rose or seem to rise
in the same robe he living wore he came in stature voice and pleasing look the same the form familiar hover d
o er his head and sleeps achilles thus the phantom said sleeps my achilles his patroclus dead living i seem his dearest tenderest care
but now forgot i wander in the air let my pale corse the rite of burial know and give me entrance in the realm below
till then the spirit finds no resting place but here and there the unbodied spectres chase the vagrant dead around the dark abode forbid to cross the irremeable flood
now give thy hand for to the farther shore when once we pass the soul return no more when once the last funereal flame ascend no more shall meet achilles and his friend no more our thought to those we loved make known or quit the dearest to converse alone
me fate has sever from the son of earth the fate fore doom that waited from my birth thee too it waits before the trojan wall even great and godlike thou art doom to fall
together have we lived together bred one house received us and one table fed that golden urn thy goddess mother gave may mix our ashes in one common grave
hear then and as in fate and love we join ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine and is it thou
he answers to my sight once more return st thou from the realm of night more than brother think each office paid whate er can rest a discontented shade but grant one last embrace unhappy boy
afford at least that melancholy joy he said and with his longing arm essay in vain to grasp the visionary shade
confused he wakes amazement breaks the band of golden sleep and starting from the sands pensive he muses with uplifted hand tis true tis certain man though dead retains part of himself the immortal mind remains the form subsists without the body aid aerial semblance and an empty shade
this night my friend so late in battle lost stood at my side a pensive plaintive ghost even now familiar as in life he came
like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly and hears a feeble lamentable cry alas how different yet how like the same
thus while he spoke each eye grew big with tear and now the rosy finger morn appears shows every mournful face with tear erspread and glares on the pale visage of the dead
but agamemnon as the rite demand with mules and waggons sends a chosen band to load the timber and the pile to rear a charge consign to merion faithful care
with proper instruments they take the road axes to cut and ropes to sling the load first march the heavy mules securely slow er hill er dales er crags er rock they go
jumping high er the shrubs of the rough ground rattle the clattering car and the shock axles bound but when arrived at ida spreading wood
fair ida water with descending flood loud sound the axe redoubling strokes on strokes on all side round the forest hurls her oaks headlong
deep echoing groan the thickets brown then rustling crackling crashing thunder down the wood the grecians cleave prepared to burn and the slow mules the same rough road return
the sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore such charge was given them to the sandy shore there on the spot which great achilles show they eased their shoulder and disposed the load circling around the place where time to come
the hero bids his martial troop appear high on their car in all the pomp of war each in refulgent arm his limb attires
shall view patroclus and achilles tomb all mount their chariot combatants and squires the chariot first proceed a shining train
then cloud of foot that smoke along the plain next these the melancholy band appear amidst lay dead patroclus on the bier er all the corse their scattered locks they throw achilles next oppress with mighty woe supporting with his hand the hero head bends er the extended body of the dead
but great achilles stands apart in prayer and from his head divides the yellow hair those curling locks which from his youth he vow
patroclus decent on the appointed ground they place and heap the sylvan pile around and sacred grew to sperchius honour flood
then sighing to the deep his locks he cast and roll his eye around the watery waste sperchius whose wave in mazy errors lost delightful roll along my native coast
to whom we vainly vow at our return these locks to fall and hecatombs to burn full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice where to the day
thy silver fountains rise and where in shade of consecrated bowers thy altars stand perfumed with native flowers so vow my father but he vow in vain
no more achilles sees his native plain in that vain hope these hair no longer grow patroclus bears them to the shade below
thus er patroclus while the hero pray on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid once more afresh the grecian sorrow flow and now the sun had set upon their woe
but to the king of man thus spoke the chief enough atrides give the troop relief permit the mourning legions to retire and let the chief alone attend the pyre the pious care be ours the dead to burn
he said the people to their ship return while those deputed to inter the slain heap with a rising pyramid the plain
a hundred foot in length a hundred wide the growing structure spreads on every side high on the top the manly corse they lay and well fed sheep and sable oxen slay achilles covered with their fat the dead
and the piled victim round the body spread then jars of honey and of fragrant oil suspends around low bending er the pile
four sprightly courser with a deadly groan pour forth their life and on the pyre are thrown of nine large dog domestic at his board fall two selected to attend their lord
then last of all and horrible to tell sad sacrifice twelve trojan captives fell on these the rage of fire victorious prey involves and joins them in one common blaze
smear with the bloody rite he stands on high and calls the spirit with a dreadful cry all hail patroclus let thy vengeful ghost hear and exult on pluto dreary coast
behold achilles promise fully paid twelve trojan hero offer to thy shade but heavier fate on stern_hector corse attend saved from the flame for hungry dog to rend
so spake he threatening but the god made vain his threat and guard inviolate the slain celestial venus hover o er his head and roseate unguents heavenly fragrance
shed she watch him all the night and all the day and drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey nor sacred phoebus less
he pour around a veil of gather air and kept the nerves undried the flesh entire against the solar beam and sirian fire
nor yet the pile where dead patroclus lies smokes nor as yet the sullen flame arise but fast beside achilles stood in prayer invoked the god whose spirit moves the air and victim promised and libations cast to gentle zephyr and the boreal blast
employ his care illustration the funeral pile of patroclus the funeral pile of patroclus he call the aerial power along the sky to breathe and whisper to the fire to rise
the winged iris heard the hero call and instant hasten to their airy hall where in old zephyr open courts on high sat all the blustering brother of the sky
she shone amidst them on her painted bow the rocky pavement glitter with the show all from the banquet rise and each invites the various goddess to partake the rite
not so the dame replied i haste to go to sacred ocean and the flood below even now our solemn hecatombs attend and heaven is feasting on the world green end with righteous ethiops uncorrupted train
far on the extremest limits of the main but peleus son entreats with sacrifice the western spirit and the north to rise
swift as the word she vanish from their view swift as the word the wind tumultuous flew forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar and heap on heap the cloud are toss before
to the wide main then stooping from the sky the heaving deeps in watery mountain rise troy feels the blast along her shaking wall
let on patroclus pile your blast be driven and bear the blazing honour high to heaven till on the pile the gather tempest fall
the structure crackles in the roaring fire and all the night the plenteous flame aspires all night achilles hails patroclus soul with large libations from the golden bowl
as a poor father helpless and undone mourns er the ashes of an only son takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn and pours in tear ere
yet they close the urn so stay achilles circling round the shore so watch the flame till now they flame no more
the morning planet told the approach of light and fast behind aurora warmer ray er the broad ocean pour the golden day then sank the blaze the pile no longer burn and to their caves the whistling wind return across the thracian sea their course they bore
then parting from the pile he ceased to weep and sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep exhausted with his grief meanwhile the crowd of thronging grecians round achilles stood the tumult waked him from his eye he shook unwilling slumber and the chief bespoke
twas when emerging through the shade of night the ruffled sea beneath their passage roar ye king and prince of the achaian name
first let us quench the yet remaining flame with sable wine then as the rite direct the hero bones with careful view select
amidst the heap and obvious to the eye the rest around the margin will be seen promiscuous steed and immolated man
apart and easy to be known they lie these wrapp in double cauls of fat prepare and in the golden vase dispose with care there let them rest with decent honour laid
meantime erect the tomb with pious hand a common structure on the humble sands hereafter greece some nobler work may raise and late posterity record our praise
the greeks obey where yet the embers glow wide er the pile the sable wine they throw and deep subsides the ashy heap below
till i shall follow to the infernal shade next the white bones his sad companions place with tear collected in the golden vase
that done they bid the sepulchre aspire and cast the deep foundations round the pyre high in the midst they heap the swelling bed of rising earth memorial of the dead
the sacred relics to the tent they bore the urn a veil of linen covered er the swarming populace the chief detains and leads amidst a wide extent of plain
there placed them round then from the ship proceeds a train of oxen mules and stately steed vases and tripods for the funeral games resplendent brass and more resplendent dame
first stood the prize to reward the force of rapid racers in the dusty course a woman for the first in beauty bloom skill in the needle and the labouring loom and a large vase where two bright handles rise of twenty measures its capacious size
the second victor claims a mare unbroke big with a mule unknowing of the yoke the third a charger yet untouch by flame four ample measures held the shining frame two golden talents for the fourth were placed an ample double bowl contents the last
these in fair order ranged upon the plain the hero rising thus address the train behold the prize valiant greeks decreed to the brave rulers of the racing steed
prize which none beside ourself could gain should our immortal courser take the plain a race unrivall which from ocean god peleus received and on his son bestow
but this no time our vigour to display nor suit with them the games of this sad day lost is patroclus now that wont to deck their flowing manes and sleek their glossy neck
sad as they shared in human grief they stand and trail those graceful honour on the sand let other for the noble task prepare who trust the courser and the flying car
fired at his word the rival racers rise but far the first eumelus hope the prize famed though pieria for the fleetest breed and skill to manage the high bounding steed
with equal ardour bold tydides swell the steed of tros beneath his yoke compell which late obey the dardan chief command
then great_menelaus his podargus brings and the famed courser of the king of king whom rich echepolus more rich than brave to scape the war to agamemnon gave ćthe her name at home to end his day base wealth preferring to eternal praise
when scarce a god redeem him from his hand next him antilochus demands the course with beating heart and cheers his pylian horse
experienced wise_nestor gives his son the rein directs his judgment and his heat restrains nor idly warns the hoary sire nor hears the prudent son with unattending ear
my son though youthful ardour fire thy breast the god have loved thee and with art have bless neptune and which_jove on thee conferr the skill swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel
fear not thy rivals though for swiftness known compare those rivals judgment and thy own it is not strength but art obtains the prize and to be swift is less than to be wise_nestor
to guide thy conduct little precept needs but slow and past their vigour are my steed tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
the dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks by art the pilot through the boiling deep and howling tempest steers the fearless ship and tis the artist wins the glorious course not those who trust in chariot and in horse
in vain unskilful to the goal they strive and short or wide the ungovern courser drive while with sure skill though with inferior steed the knowing racer to his end proceeds fix on the goal his eye foreruns the course his hand unerring steers the steady horse and now contracts or now extends the rein observing still the foremost on the plain
mark then the goal tis easy to be found yon aged trunk a cubit from the ground of some once stately oak the last remains or hardy fir unperish with the rains
inclosed with stone conspicuous from afar and round a circle for the wheeling car some tomb perhaps of old the dead to grace or then as now the limit of a race
bear close to this and warily proceed a little bending to the left hand steed but urge the right and give him all the rein while thy strict hand his fellow head restrains and turns him short till doubling as they roll the wheel round naves appear to brush the goal
clear of the stony heap direct the course lest through incaution failing thou mayst be a joy to other a reproach to me
so shalt thou pass the goal secure of mind and leave unskilful swiftness far behind though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed which bore adrastus of celestial breed or the famed race through all the regions known that whirl the car of proud laomedon
yet not to break the car or lame the horse thus nought unsaid the much advising sage concludes then sat stiff with unwieldy age
next bold meriones was seen to rise the last but not least ardent for the prize they mount their seat the lots their place dispose roll in his helmet these achilles throws
young wise_nestor leads the race eumelus then and next the brother of the king of man thy lot meriones the fourth was cast and far the bravest diomed was last
they stand in order an impatient train pelides point the barrier on the plain and sends before old phoenix to the place to mark the racers and to judge the race
at once the courser from the barrier bound the lifted scourges all at once resound their heart their eye their voice they send before
and up the champaign thunder from the shore thick where they drive the dusty cloud arise and the lost courser in the whirlwind fly loose on their shoulder the long manes reclined float in their speed and dance upon the wind
the smoking chariot rapid as they bound now seem to touch the sky and now the ground while hot for fame and conquest all their care each er his flying courser hung in air
erect with ardour poised upon the rein they pant they stretch they shout along the plain now the last compass fetch around the goal
at the near prize each gathers all his soul each burns with double hope with double pain tear up the shore and thunder toward the main
first flew eumelus on pheretian steed with those of tros bold diomed succeeds close on eumelus back they puff the wind and seem just mounting on his car behind
then had he lost or left a doubtful prize but angry phoebus to tydides fly strikes from his hand the scourge and renders vain his matchless horse labour on the plain
full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze and hovering er their stretching shadows sees rage fills his eye with anguish to survey snatch from his hope the glory of the day
the fraud celestial pallas sees with pain spring to her knight and gives the scourge again and fills his steed with vigour
at a stroke she breaks his rival chariot from the yoke no more their way the startled horse held the car reversed came rattling on the field
shot headlong from his seat beside the wheel prone on the dust the unhappy master fell his batter face and elbows strike the ground
nose mouth and front one undistinguish wound grief stops his voice a torrent drowns his eye before him far the glad tydides fly minerva spirit drives his matchless pace and crowns him victor of the labour race
the next though distant great_menelaus succeeds while thus young wise_nestor animates his steed now now my generous pair exert your force not that we hope to match tydides horse since great minerva wing their rapid way and gives their lord the honour of the day but reach atrides
shall his mare outgo your swiftness vanquish by a female foe through your neglect if lagging on the plain the last ignoble gift be all we gain
no more shall wise_nestor hand your food supply the old man fury rises and ye die haste then yon narrow road before our sight presents the occasion could we use it right
thus he the courser at their master threat with quicker steps the sounding champaign beat and now antilochus with nice survey observes the compass of the hollow way
twas where by force of wintry torrents torn fast by the road a precipice was worn here where but one could pass to shun the throng the spartan hero chariot smoked along
close up the venturous youth resolves to keep still edging near and bears him toward the steep atrides trembling casts his eye below and wonders at the rashness of his foe
hold stay your steed what madness thus to ride this narrow way take larger field he cried or both must fall atrides cried in vain he fly more fast and throws up all the rein
far as an able arm the disk can send when youthful rivals their full force extend so far antilochus thy chariot flew before the king he cautious backward drew his horse compell foreboding in his fear the rattling ruin of the clashing car the floundering courser rolling on the plain and conquest lost through frantic haste to gain
but thus upbraids his rival as he fly go furious youth ungenerous and unwise go but expect not i ll the prize resign add perjury to fraud and make it thine
your rivals destitute of youthful force with fainting knees shall labour in the course and yield the glory yours the steed obey already at their heels they wing their way and seem already to retrieve the day
then to his steed with all his force he cry be swift be vigorous and regain the prize meantime the grecians in a ring beheld
them was the cretan king high on a rising ground above the ring the monarch sat from whence with sure survey he well observed the chief who led the way and heard from far his animating cry and saw the foremost steed with sharpen eye
the courser bounding er the dusty field the first who mark on whose broad front a blaze of shining white like the full moon stood obvious to the sight
he saw and rising to the greeks begun are yonder horse discern by me alone or can ye all another chief survey and other steed than lately led the way
those though the swiftest by some god withheld lie sure disabled in the middle field for since the goal they doubled round the plain i search to find them but i search in vain
perchance the rein forsook the driver hand and turn too short he tumbled on the strand shot from the chariot while his courser stray with frantic fury from the destined way
rise then some other and inform my sight for these dim eye perhaps discern not right yet sure he seems to judge by shape and air the great ćtolian chief renown in war
thy tongue too hastily confers the prize of those who view the course nor sharpest eyed nor youngest yet the readiest to decide
eumelus steed high bounding in the chase still as at first unrivall lead the race i well discern him as he shakes the rein and hear his shouts victorious er the plain
old man oileus rashly thus replies thus he idomeneus incensed rejoin barbarous of word and arrogant of mind contentious prince of all the greeks beside the last in merit as the first in pride
to vile reproach what answer can we make a goblet or a tripod let us stake and be the king the judge
the most unwise will learn their rashness when they pay the price he said and oilean_ajax by mad passion borne stern_hector had replied fierce scorn enhancing scorn to fell extremes
but thetis godlike son awful amidst them rose and thus begun forbear ye chief reproachful to contend much would ye blame should other thus offend and lo
the approaching steed your contest end no sooner had he spoke but thundering near drives through a stream of dust the charioteer
his car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold refulgent through the cloud no eye could find the track his flying wheels had left behind and the fierce courser urged their rapid pace
high er his head the circling lash he wields his bounding horse scarcely touch the field so swift it seem a flight and not a race
now victor at the goal tydides stands quits his bright car and spring upon the sands from the hot steed the sweaty torrents stream the well plied whip is hung athwart the beam with joy brave sthenelus receives the prize
the tripod vase and dame with radiant eye these to the ship his train triumphant leads the chief himself unyokes the panting steed
young wise_nestor follows who by art not force erpass atrides second in the course behind atrides urged the race more near than to the courser in his swift career
the following car just touching with his heel and brushing with his tail the whirling wheel such and so narrow now the space between the rivals late so distant on the green
so soon swift ćthe her lost ground regain one length one moment had the race obtain merion pursued at greater distance still with tardier courser and inferior skill
last came admetus thy unhappy son slow dragged the steed his batter chariot on achilles saw and pitying thus begun behold
the man whose matchless art surpass the son of greece the ablest yet the last fortune denies but justice bids us pay since great tydides bears the first away
to him the second honour of the day the greeks consent with loud applauding cry and then eumelus had received the prize
but youthful wise_nestor jealous of his fame the award opposes and asserts his claim think not he cry i tamely will resign peleus son
the mare so justly mine what if the god the skilful to confound have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground
perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice and vows omitted forfeited the prize if yet distinction to thy friend to show and please a soul desirous to bestow
view thy store of beauteous handmaids steed and shining ore an ample present let him thence receive and greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give
some gift must grace eumelus but this my prize i never shall forego this who but touches warrior is my foe
thus spake the youth nor did his word offend pleased with the well turn flattery of a friend achilles smiled the gift proposed he cried antilochus
we shall ourself provide with plates of brass the corslet cover o er the same renown asteropaeus wore whose glittering margins raised with silver shine no vulgar gift eumelus shall be thine
his bosom glows with generous joy then great_menelaus rose the herald placed the sceptre in his hand and still the clamour of the shouting band
not without cause incensed at wise_nestor son and inly grieving thus the king begun the praise of wisdom in thy youth obtain an act so rash antilochus has stain
he said automedon at his command the corslet brought and gave it to his hand distinguish by his friend robb of my glory and my just reward to you grecians
be my wrong declared so not a leader shall our conduct blame or judge me envious of a rival fame but shall not we ourselves the truth maintain
what needs appealing in a fact so plain what greek shall blame me if i bid thee rise and vindicate by oath th ill gotten prize
rise if thou darest before thy chariot stand the driving scourge high lifted in thy hand and touch thy steed and swear thy whole intent was but to conquer not to circumvent
the prudent chief with calm attention heard then mildly thus excuse if youth have err superior as thou art forgive the offence
swear by that god whose liquid arm surround the globe and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground nor i thy equal or in year or sense
thou know st the errors of unripen age weak are its counsel headlong is its rage the prize i quit if thou thy wrath resign the mare or aught thou ask st be freely thine ere
i become from thy dear friendship torn hateful to thee and to the god forsworn so spoke antilochus and at the word the mare contested to the king restored
joy swells his soul as when the vernal grain lifts the green ear above the springing plain the field their vegetable life renew and laugh and glitter with the morning dew such joy the spartan shining face erspread and lifted his gay heart while thus he said still may our soul generous youth
agree tis now atrides turn to yield to thee rash heat perhaps a moment might control not break the settled temper of thy soul
not but my friend tis still the wiser way to waive contention with superior sway for ah how few who should like thee offend like thee have talents to regain the friend
to plead indulgence and thy fault atone suffice thy father merit and thy own generous alike for me the sire and son have greatly suffer and have greatly done
he said and pleased his passion to command resign the courser to noemon hand friend of the youthful chief himself content
i yield that all may know my soul can bend nor is my pride preferr before my friend the shining charger to his vessel sent
the golden talents merion next obtain the fifth reward the double bowl remain achilles this to reverend wise_nestor bears and thus the purpose of his gift declares
accept thou this sacred sire he said in dear memorial of patroclus dead dead and for ever lost patroclus lies for ever snatch from our desiring eye
take thou this token of a grateful heart though tis not thine to hurl the distant dart the quoit to toss the ponderous mace to wield or urge the race or wrestle on the field
he said and placed the goblet at his side with joy the venerable king replied wisely and well my son thy word have proved
thy pristine vigour age has overthrown but left the glory of the past thy own a senior honour and a friend beloved
too true it is deserted of my strength these wither arm and limb have fail at length oh had i now
that force i felt of yore known through buprasium and the pylian shore victorious then in every solemn game ordain to amarynces mighty name the brave epeians gave my glory way
ćtolians pylians all resign the day i quell clytomedes in fight of hand and backward hurl ancaeus on the sand surpass iphyclus in the swift career phyleus and polydorus with the spear
for the famed twins impatient to survey prize after prize by wise_nestor borne away sprung to their car and with united pain
the son of actor won the prize of horse but won by number not by art or force one lash the courser while one ruled the rein
such once i was now to these tasks succeeds a younger race that emulate our deed i yield alas to age who must not yield
though once the foremost hero of the field go thou my son by generous friendship led with martial honour decorate the dead while pleased i take the gift thy hand present
pledge of benevolence and kind intent rejoiced of all the numerous greeks to see not one but honour sacred age and me
those due distinctions thou so well canst pay may the just god return another day proud of the gift thus spake the full of day achilles heard him prouder of the praise
a stately mule as yet by toil unbroke of six year age unconscious of the yoke is to the circus led and firmly bound next stands a goblet massy large and round
let greece excite two hero equal to this hardy fight who dare the foe with lifted arm provoke and rush beneath the long descending stroke
the prize next are order to the field for the bold champions who the caestus wield achilles rising thus on whom apollo shall the palm bestow and whom the greeks supreme by conquest know
this mule his dauntless labour shall repay the vanquish bear the massy bowl away this dreadful combat great epeus chose
high er the crowd enormous bulk he rose and seized the beast and thus began to say stand forth some man to bear the bowl away
price of his ruin for who dares deny this mule my right the undoubted victor i other tis own in field of battle shine
then let my foe draw near but first his certain fortune know secure this hand shall his whole frame confound mash all his bones and all his body pound
but the first honour of this fight are mine for who excels in all so let his friend be nigh a needful train
to heave the batter carcase off the plain the giant spoke and in a stupid gaze the host beheld him silent with amaze
twas thou euryalus who durst aspire to meet his might and emulate thy sire the great mecistheus who in day of yore
him great tydides urges to contend warm with the hope of conquest for his friend officious with the cincture girds him round and to his wrist the gloves of death are bound
amid the circle now each champion stands and poises high in air his iron hand with clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close
in theban games the noblest trophy bore the games ordain dead oedipus to grace and singly vanquish the cadmean race their crackling jaws re echo to the blow and painful sweat from all their members flows
at length epeus dealt a weighty blow full on the cheek of his unwary foe beneath that ponderous arm resistless sway down
as a large fish when wind and water roar by some huge billow dash against the shore lies panting not less batter with his wound the bleeding hero pants upon the ground
to rear his fallen foe the victor lends scornful his hand and gives him to his friend whose arm support him reeling through the throng and dragging his disabled legs along nodding his head hangs down his shoulder er his mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore wrapp round in mists he lies and lost to thought his friend receive the bowl too dearly bought
dropp he nerveless and extended lay the third bold game achilles next demands and calls the wrestlers to the level sands
a massy tripod for the victor lies of twice six oxen its reputed price and next the loser spirit to restore a female captive valued but at four
scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop when tower like oilean_ajax and ulysses rose amid the ring each nervous rival stands embracing rigid with implicit hand
below their planted foot at distance fix like two strong rafters which the builder form proof to the wintry wind and howling storm their tops connected but at wider space fix on the centre stands their solid base
now to the grasp each manly body bends the humid sweat from every pore descends their bones resound with blow side shoulder thighs swell to each gripe and bloody tumours rise
nor could ulysses for his art renown o erturn the strength of oilean_ajax on the ground nor could the strength of oilean_ajax overthrow the watchful caution of his artful foe
close lock above their head and arm are mix while the long strife even tired the lookers on thus to ulysses spoke great ajax_telamon
or let me lift thee chief or lift thou me prove we our force and which_jove the rest decree
he said and straining heaved him off the ground with matchless strength that time ulysses found the strength to evade and where the nerves combine his ankle struck the giant fell supine ulysses following on his bosom lies shouts of applause run rattling through the sky
oilean_ajax to lift ulysses next essays he barely stirr him but he could not raise his knee lock fast the foe attempt denied and grappling close they tumbled side by side
defiled with honourable dust they roll still breathing strife and unsubdued of soul again they rage again to combat rise when great achilles thus divides the prize your noble vigour my friend restrain nor weary out your generous strength in vain
ye both have won let other who excel now prove that prowess you have proved so well the hero word the willing chief obey from their tired body

the glorious gift and for lycaon spared to brave patroclus gave the rich reward now the same hero funeral rite to grace it stands the prize of swiftness in the race
a well fed ox was for the second placed and half a talent must content the last achilles rising then bespoke the train
the hero said and starting from his place oilean_ajax rises to the race ulysses next and he whose speed surpass his youthful equals wise_nestor son the last
ranged in a line the ready racers stand pelides point the barrier with his hand all start at once oileus led the race the next ulysses measuring pace with pace behind him diligently close he sped as closely following as the running thread
who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain stand forth and bear these prize from the plain the spindle follows and displays the charm of the fair spinster breast and moving arm
graceful in motion thus his foe he plies and treads each footstep ere the dust can rise his glowing breath upon his shoulder plays
the admiring greeks loud acclamations raise to him they give their wishes heart and eye and send their soul before him as he fly
now three time turn in prospect of the goal the panting chief to pallas lifts his soul assist goddess thus in thought he pray
and present at his thought descends the maid buoy by her heavenly force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb
all fierce and ready now the prize to gain unhappy oilean_ajax stumbles on the plain erturn by pallas where the slippery shore was clogg with slimy dung and mingled gore
the self same place beside patroclus pyre where late the slaughter victim fed the fire besmear with filth and blotted er with clay
obscene to sight the rueful racer lay the well fed bull the second prize he shared and left the urn ulysses rich reward
then grasping by the horn the mighty beast the baffled hero thus the greeks address accursed fate the conquest i forego a mortal i
a goddess was my foe she urged her favourite on the rapid way and pallas not ulysses won the day
antilochus more humorous than the rest takes the last prize and takes it with a jest why with our wiser elders should we strive
thus sourly wail he sputtering dirt and gore a burst of laughter echoed through the shore the god still love them and they always thrive
ye see to oilean_ajax i must yield the prize he to ulysses still more aged and wise_nestor a green old age unconscious of decays that proves the hero born in better day
behold his vigour in this active race achilles only boasts a swifter pace for who can match achilles he who can must yet be more than hero more than man
the effect succeeds the speech pelides cry thy artful praise deserves a better prize nor greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll
receive a talent of the purest gold the youth departs content the host admire the son of wise_nestor worthy of his sire
next these a buckler spear and helm he brings cast on the plain the brazen burden rings arm which of late divine sarpedon wore and great patroclus in short triumph bore
whoever dares deserve so rich a prize now grace the lists before our army sight and sheathed in steel provoke his foe to fight
who first the jointed armour shall explore and stain his rival mail with issuing gore the sword asteropaeus possess of old a thracian blade distinct with studs of gold
shall pay the stroke and grace the striker side these arm in common let the chief divide for each brave champion when the combat ends a sumptuous banquet at our tent attends

opposed in arm not long they idly stood but thrice they closed and thrice the charge renew a furious pass the spear of oilean_ajax made through the broad shield but at the corslet stay
not thus the foe his javelin aim above the buckler margin at the neck he drove but greece now trembling for her hero life bade share the honour and surcease the strife
then hurl the hero thundering on the ground a mass of iron an enormous round whose weight and size the circling greeks admire rude from the furnace and but shaped by fire

yet still the victor due tydides gains with him the sword and studded belt remains among his spoil this memorable load
for this he bids those nervous artists vie that teach the disk to sound along the sky let him whose might can hurl this bowl arise
who farthest hurls it take it as his prize if he be one enrich with large domain of downs for flocks and arable for grain small stock of iron needs that man provide his hinds and swains whole year shall be supplied from hence nor ask the neighbouring city aid for ploughshares wheels and all the rural trade

the dove in airy circle as she wheels amid the cloud the piercing arrow feels quite through and through the point its passage found and at his foot fell bloody to the ground
didst thou vow to phoebus patron of the shaft and bow for this thy well aim arrow the wounded bird ere yet
she breathed her last with flagging wing alighted on the mast a moment hung and spread her pinions there then sudden dropp and left her life in air
from the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise and to the ship brave merion bears the prize to close the funeral games achilles last a massy spear amid the circle placed and ample charger of unsullied frame
with flowers high wrought not blacken yet by flame for these he bids the hero prove their art whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart
with joy pelides saw the honour paid rose to the monarch and respectful said thee first in virtue as in power supreme king of nation
here too great merion hope the noble prize nor here disdain the king of man to rise all thy greeks proclaim
in every martial game thy worth attest and know thee both their greatest and their best take then the prize but let brave merion bear this beamy javelin in thy brother war

so broad his pinions stretch their ample shade as stooping dexter with resounding wing the imperial bird descends in airy rings
a dawn of joy in every face appears the mourning matron dries her timorous tear swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung
the brazen portal in his passage rung the mules preceding draw the loaded wain charged with the gift idaeus holds the rein the king himself his gentle steed controls and through surrounding friend the chariot rolls

and mounts incumbent on the wing of wind that high through field of air his flight sustain er the wide earth and er the boundless main then grasps the wand that cause sleep to fly or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye
the observing foe prevent and safe conduct him to achilles tent the god obeys his golden pinions binds thus arm swift hermes steers his airy way and stoops on hellespont resounding sea
now twilight veil the glaring face of day and clad the dusky field in sober grey what time the herald and the hoary king their chariot stopping at the silver spring that circling ilus ancient marble flows
a beauteous youth majestic and divine he seem fair offspring of some princely line allow their mules and steed a short repose
through the dim shade the herald first espies a man approach and thus to priam cry i mark some foe advance king
beware this hard adventure claims thy utmost care for much i fear destruction hovers nigh our state asks counsel is it best to fly
or old and helpless at his foot to fall two wretched suppliants and for mercy call the afflicted monarch shiver with despair pale grew his face and upright stood his hair
sunk was his heart his colour went and came a sudden trembling shook his aged frame when hermes greeting touch his royal hand and gentle thus accosts with kind demand say whither father
when each mortal sight is seal in sleep thou wanderest through the night why roam thy mules and steed the plain along through grecian foe so numerous and so strong
what couldst thou hope should these thy treasures view these who with endless hate thy race pursue for what defence alas
yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread from me no harm shall touch thy reverend head from greece i ll guard thee too for in those line the living image of my father shines
could st thou provide thyself not young a weak old man thy guide thy word that speak benevolence of mind are true my son
the godlike sire rejoin great are my hazards but the god survey my steps and send thee guardian of my way
hail and be bless for scarce of mortal kind appear thy form thy feature and thy mind nor true are all thy word nor erring wide the sacred messenger of heaven replied
but say convey st thou through the lonely plain what yet most precious of thy store remains to lodge in safety with some friendly hand prepared perchance to leave thy native land
or fliest thou now what hope can troy retain thy matchless son her guard and glory slain the king alarm
say what and whence thou art who search the sorrow of a parent heart and know so well how godlike stern_hector died
thus priam spoke and hermes thus replied you tempt me father and with pity touch on this sad subject you inquire too much
oft have these eye that godlike stern_hector view in glorious fight with grecian blood embrued i saw him when like which_jove his flame he
on thousand ship and wither half a host i saw but help not stern_hector achilles ire forbade assistance and enjoy the fire
polyctor is my sire an honour name old like thyself and not unknown to fame of seven his son by whom the lot was cast to serve our prince it fell on me the last
toss for him i serve of myrmidonian race one ship convey us from our native place to watch this quarter my adventure fall
for with the morn the greeks attack your wall sleepless they sit impatient to engage and scarce their rulers check their martial rage
if then thou art of stern_hector pelides train the mournful monarch thus rejoin again ah tell me truly where oh where are laid my son dear relics
what befals him dead have dog dismember on the naked plain or yet unmangled rest his cold remains favour of the sky
thus answered then the power that mediates between god and man nor dog nor vultures have thy stern_hector rent but whole he lies neglected in the tent
this the twelfth evening since he rested there untouch by worms untainted by the air still as aurora ruddy beam is spread round his friend tomb achilles drags the dead
yet undisfigured or in limb or face all fresh he lies with every living grace majestical in death no stains are found er all the corse and closed is every wound though many a wound they gave
some heavenly care some hand divine preserves him ever fair or all the host of heaven to whom he led a life so grateful still regard him dead
thus spoke to priam the celestial guide and joyful thus the royal sire replied blest is the man who pays the god above the constant tribute of respect and love
those who inhabit the olympian bower my son forgot not in exalted power and heaven that every virtue bears in mind even to the ashes of the just is kind
a pledge of gratitude for stern_hector sake and while the favouring god our steps survey safe to pelides tent conduct my way
but thou generous youth this goblet take to whom the latent god king forbear to tempt my youth for apt is youth to err
but can i absent from my prince sight take gift in secret that must shun the light what from our master interest thus we draw is but a licensed theft that scapes the law
thee far as argos pleased i could convey guard of thy life and partner of thy way on thee attend thy safety to maintain er pathless forests or the roaring main
he said then took the chariot at a bound and snatch the rein and whirl the lash around before the inspiring god that urged them on the courser fly with spirit not their own
respecting him my soul abjures the offence and as the crime i dread the consequence and now they reach the naval wall and found the guards repasting while the bowls go round
on these the virtue of his wand he tries and pours deep slumber on their watchful eye then heaved the massy gate removed the bars and er the trenches led the rolling car
on firs the roof was raised and cover o er with reeds collected from the marshy shore and fenced with palisades a hall of state the work of soldiers where the hero sat
unseen through all the hostile camp they went and now approach pelides lofty tent large was the door whose well compacted strength a solid pine tree
this hermes such the power of god set wide then swift alighted the celestial guide and thus reveal hear prince and understand
barr of wondrous length scarce three strong greeks could lift its mighty weight but great achilles singly closed the gate thou ow st
thy guidance to no mortal hand hermes i am descended from above the king of art the messenger of which_jove farewell to shun achilles sight i fly uncommon are such favours of the sky nor stand confess to frail mortality
now fearless enter and prefer thy prayer adjure him by his father silver hair his son his mother urge him to bestow whatever pity that stern_hector heart can know
the king confirm from heaven alighted there and left his aged herald on the car with solemn pace through various rooms he went and found achilles in his inner tent
thus having said he vanish from his eye and in a moment shot into the sky there sat the hero
alcimus the brave and great automedon attendance gave these served his person at the royal feast around at awful distance stood the rest
unseen by these the king his entry made and prostrate now before achilles laid sudden a venerable sight appears embraced his knees and bathed his hand in tear
those direful hand his kisses press embrued even with the best the dearest of his blood as when a wretch who conscious of his crime pursued for murder fly his native clime
just gains some frontier breathless pale amazed all gaze all wonder thus achilles gazed thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise
all mute yet seem to question with their eye each look on other none the silence broke till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke ah think thou
favour of the power divine think of thy father age and pity mine in me that father reverend image trace those silver hair that venerable face his trembling limb his helpless person see
yet now perhaps some turn of human fate expels him helpless from his peaceful state think from some powerful foe thou seest him fly and beg protection with a feeble cry
yet still one comfort in his soul may rise he hears his son still life to glad his eye and hearing still may hope a better day may send him thee to chase that foe away
in all my equal but in misery no comfort to my grief no hope remain the best the bravest of my son are slain
yet what a race ere greece to ilion came the pledge of many a loved and loving dame nineteen one mother bore
dead all are dead how oft alas has wretched priam bled still one was left their loss to recompense his father hope his country last defence
him too thy rage has slain beneath thy steel unhappy in his country cause he fell for him through hostile camp i bent my way
for him thus prostrate at thy foot i lay large gift proportion to thy wrath i bear hear the wretched and the god revere
think of thy father and this face behold see him in me as helpless and as old though not so wretched there he yields to me
thus forced to kneel thus grovelling to embrace the scourge and ruin of my realm and race suppliant my children murderer to implore and kiss those hand yet reeking with their gore
the first of man in sovereign misery these word soft pity in the chief inspire touch with the dear remembrance of his sire
now each by turns indulged the gush of woe and now the mingled tide together flow this low on earth that gently bending er a father one and one a son deplore
then with his hand as prostrate still he lay the old man cheek he gently turn away but great achilles different passions rend and now his sire he mourns and now his friend
the infectious softness through the hero ran one universal solemn shower began they bore as hero but they felt as man
satiate at length with unavailing woe from the high throne divine achilles rose the reverend monarch by the hand he raised on his white beard and form majestic gazed not unrelenting then serene began with word to soothe the miserable man
alas what weight of anguish hast thou known unhappy prince thus guardless and alone two pass through foe and thus undaunted face
the man whose fury has destroy thy race heaven sure has arm thee with a heart of steel a strength proportion to the woe you feel
rise then let reason mitigate your care to mourn avails not man is born to bear such is alas the god severe decree
the source of evil one and one of good from thence the cup of mortal man he fills blessings to these to those distributes ill to most he mingles both the wretch decreed to taste the bad unmix is cursed indeed pursued by wrongs by meagre famine driven he wanders outcast both of earth and heaven
they only they are blest and only free two urns by which_jove high throne have ever stood the happiest taste not happiness sincere but find the cordial draught is dash with care
who more than peleus shone in wealth and power what stars concurring bless his natal hour a realm a goddess to his wishes given graced by the god with all the gift of heaven
one evil yet ertakes his latest day no race succeeding to imperial sway an only son and he alas ordain to fall untimely in a foreign land
old man hast happier day beheld in riches once in children once excell extended phrygia own thy ample reign and all fair lesbos blissful seat contain and all wide hellespont unmeasured main
but since the god his hand has pleased to turn and fill thy measure from his bitter urn what sees the sun but hapless hero fall
see him in troy the pious care decline of his weak age to live the curse of thine thou too war and the blood of man surround thy wall
bear thy lot nor shed these unavailing sorrow er the dead thou canst not call him from the stygian shore but thou alas
what must be must be may st live to suffer more to whom the king favour of the sky here let me grow to earth since stern_hector lies on the bare beach deprived of obsequies
o give me stern_hector to my eye restore his corse and take the gift i ask no more thou as thou may st these boundless stores enjoy
safe may st thou sail and turn thy wrath from troy so shall thy pity and forbearance give a weak old man to see the light and live
move me no more achilles thus replies while kindling anger sparkled in his eye nor seek by tear my steady soul to bend
to yield thy stern_hector i myself intend for know from which_jove my goddess mother came old ocean daughter silver footed dame nor comest thou
no human hand the weighty gate unbarr nor could the boldest of our youth have dared to pass our outworks or elude the guard
but by heaven nor comest alone some god impels with courage not thy own cease lest neglectful of high which_jove command i show thee king
thou tread st on hostile land release my knees thy suppliant art give er and shake the purpose of my soul no more
he honour since he lost his friend these to unyoke the mules and horse went and led the hoary herald to the tent
the sire obey him trembling and eraw achilles like a lion rush abroad automedon and alcimus attend whom most next heap on high the numerous presents bear great stern_hector ransom from the polish car
then call the handmaids with assistant toil to wash the body and anoint with oil apart from priam lest the unhappy sire provoked to passion once more rouse to ire the stern_hector pelides and nor sacred age nor which_jove command should check the rising rage
two splendid mantles and a carpet spread they leave to cover and enwrap the dead this done the garments er the corse they spread achilles lifts it to the funeral bed
then while the body on the car they laid he groans and calls on loved patroclus shade if in that gloom which never light must know the deed of mortal touch the ghosts below friend
forgive me that i thus fulfil restoring stern_hector heaven unquestion will the gift the father gave be ever thine to grace thy manes and adorn thy shrine
he said and entering took his seat of state where full before him reverend priam sate to whom composed the godlike chief begun lo
to thy prayer restored thy breathless son extended on the funeral couch he lies and soon as morning paints the eastern sky the sight is granted to thy longing eye
but now the peaceful hour of sacred night demand reflection and to rest invite nor thou father thus consumed with woe
the common care that nourish life forego not thus did niobe of form divine a parent once whose sorrow equall thine
six youthful son as many blooming maid in one sad day beheld the stygian shade those by apollo silver bow were slain these
cynthia arrow stretch upon the plain so was her pride chastised by wrath divine who match her own with bright latona line
but two the goddess twelve the queen enjoy those boasted twelve the avenging two destroy steep in their blood and in the dust outspread nine day neglected lay exposed the dead
none by to weep them to inhume them none for which_jove had turn the nation all to stone the god themselves at length relenting gave the unhappy race the honour of a grave
through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill where round the bed whence achelous spring the watery fairies dance in mazy rings there high on sipylus shaggy brow she stands her own sad monument of woe
herself a rock for such was heaven high will the rock for ever lasts the tear for ever flow such grief king have other parent known remember theirs and mitigate thy own
the care of heaven thy stern_hector has appear nor shall he lie unwept and uninterr soon may thy aged cheeks in tear be
drown and all the eye of ilion stream around he said and rising chose the victim ewe with silver fleece which his attendants slew
the limb they sever from the reeking hide with skill prepare them and in part divide each on the coals the separate morsels lays
and hasty snatches from the rising blaze with bread the glittering canisters they load which round the board automedon bestow the chief himself to each his portion placed and each indulging shared in sweet repast
no less the royal guest the hero eye his godlike aspect and majestic size here youthful grace and noble fire engage and there the mild benevolence of age
when now the rage of hunger was repress the wondering hero eye his royal guest thus gazing long the silence neither broke
a solemn scene at length the father spoke permit me now beloved of which_jove to steep my careful temples in the dew of sleep
for since the day that number with the dead my hapless son the dust has been my bed soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eye
my only food my sorrow and my sighs till now encouraged by the grace you give i share thy banquet and consent to live
with purple soft and shaggy carpets spread forth by the flaming light they bend their way and place the couches and the coverings lay
then he now father sleep but sleep not here consult thy safety and forgive my fear lest any argive at this hour awake
to ask our counsel or our order take approaching sudden to our open tent perchance behold thee and our grace prevent
should such report thy honour person here the king of man the ransom might defer but say with speed if aught of thy desire remains unask what time the rite require to inter thy stern_hector
with that achilles bade prepare the bed for so long we stay our slaughtering arm and bid the host obey
to finish all due honour to the dead this of thy grace accord to thee are known the fear of ilion closed within her town and at what distance from our wall aspire the hill of ide and forests for the fire
if then thy will permit the monarch said nine day to vent our sorrow i request the tenth shall see the funeral and the feast
the next to raise his monument be given the twelfth we war if war be doom by heaven this thy request replied the chief
then gave his hand at parting to prevent the old man fear and turn within the tent where fair briseis bright in blooming charm expects her hero with desiring arm
enjoy till then our arm suspend the fall of troy but in the porch the king and herald rest sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast
now god and man the gift of sleep partake industrious hermes only was awake the king return revolving in his mind to pass the ramparts and the watch to blind
the power descending hover o er his head and sleep st thou father thus the vision said now dost thou sleep when stern_hector is restored
thy presence here should stern_hector atrides see thy still surviving son may sue for thee may offer all thy treasures yet contain to spare thy age and offer all in vain
waked with the word the trembling sire arose and raised his friend the god before him goes he joins the mules directs them with his hand and moves in silence through the hostile land
nor fear the grecian foe or grecian lord when now to xanthus yellow stream they drove xanthus immortal progeny of which_jove
now shed aurora round her saffron ray sprang through the gate of light and gave the day charged with the mournful load to ilion go the sage and king majestically slow
cassandra first beholds from ilion spire the sad procession of her hoary sire then as the pensive pomp advanced more near her breathless brother stretched upon the bier
the winged deity forsook their view and in a moment to olympus flew a shower of tear erflows her beauteous eye alarming thus all ilion with her cry
if er ye rush in crowds with vast delight to hail your hero glorious from the fight now meet him dead and let your sorrow flow your common triumph and your common woe
in thronging crowds they issue to the plain nor man nor woman in the wall remains in every face the self same grief is shown and troy sends forth one universal groan
turn here your steps and here your eye employ ye wretched daughter and ye son of troy at scaea gate they meet the mourning wain
the wife and mother frantic with despair kiss his pale cheek and rend their scatter hair thus wildly wailing at the gate they lay and there had
hang on the wheels and grovel round the slain sigh and sorrow out the day but godlike priam from the chariot rose forbear he cried this violence of woe
the wave of people at his word divide slow rolls the chariot through the following tide even to the palace the sad pomp
first to the palace let the car proceed then pour your boundless sorrow er the dead they wait they weep and place him on the bed of state
a melancholy choir attend around with plaintive sighs and music solemn sound alternately they sing alternate flow the obedient tear melodious in their woe
while deeper sorrow groan from each full heart and nature speaks at every pause of art first to the corse the weeping consort flew around his neck her milk white arm she threw
and oh my stern_hector oh my lord she cry snatch in thy bloom from these desiring eye thou to the dismal realm for ever gone
and i abandon desolate alone an only son once comfort of our pain sad product now of hapless love remains never to manly age that son shall rise or with increasing grace glad my eye
for ilion now her great defender slain shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain who now protects her wife with guardian care
who saves her infant from the rage of war now hostile fleet must waft those infant er those wife must wait them to a foreign shore
my son to barbarous climes shall go the sad companion of thy mother woe driven hence a slave before the victor sword condemn to toil for some inhuman lord or else some greek whose father press the plain or son or brother by great stern_hector slain in stern_hector blood his vengeance shall enjoy and hurl thee headlong from the tower of troy
thou too for thy stern_hector father never spared a foe thence all these tear and all this scene of woe thence many evils his sad parent bore
his parent many but his consort more why gav st thou not to me thy dying hand and why received not i thy last command
my soul might keep or utter with a tear which never never could be lost in air fix in my heart and oft repeated there
some word thou would st have spoke which sadly dear thus to her weeping maid she makes her moan her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan
the mournful mother next sustains her part thou the best the dearest to my heart of all my race thou most by heaven approved
while all my other son in barbarous band achilles bound and sold to foreign land this felt no chains but went a glorious ghost free and a hero to the stygian coast
sentenced tis true by his inhuman doom thy noble corse was dragg around the tomb the tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain ungenerous insult impotent and vain
and by the immortals even in death beloved yet glow st thou fresh with every living grace no mark of pain or violence of face rosy and fair
sad argive_helen next in pomp of grief appears fast from the shining sluices of her eye fall the round crystal drops while thus she cry
as phoebus silver bow dismiss thee gently to the shade below thus spoke the dame and melted into tear
ah dearest friend in whom the god had join tne mildest manner with the bravest mind now twice ten year unhappy year are er
since paris brought me to the trojan shore had i perish ere that form divine seduced this soft this easy heart of mine
yet was it ne er my fate from thee to find a deed ungentle or a word unkind when other cursed the authoress of their woe thy pity
check my sorrow in their flow if some proud brother eyed me with disdain or scornful sister with her sweeping train thy gentle accents
soften all my pain for thee i mourn and mourn myself in thee the wretched source of all this misery the fate i caused for ever i bemoan sad argive_helen has no friend now thou art gone
through troy wide streets abandon shall i roam in troy deserted as abhorr at home so spoke the fair with sorrow streaming eye
but priam check the torrent as it rose perform ye trojans what the rite require and fell the forests for a funeral pyre twelve day nor foe nor secret ambush dread achilles grants these honour to the dead
he spoke and at his word the trojan train their mules and oxen harness to the wain pour through the gate and fell from ida crown roll back the gather forests to the town
distressful beauty melts each stander by on all around the infectious sorrow grows illustration funeral of stern_hector funeral of stern_hector these toil continue nine succeeding day and high in air a sylvan structure raise
but when the tenth fair morn began to shine forth to the pile was borne the man divine and placed aloft while all with streaming eye beheld the flame and rolling smokes arise
soon as aurora daughter of the dawn with rosy lustre streak the dewy lawn again the mournful crowds surround the pyre and quench with wine the yet remaining fire
the snowy bones his friend and brother place with tear collected in a golden vase the golden vase in purple palls they roll of softest texture and inwrought with gold
last er the urn the sacred earth they spread and raised the tomb memorial of the dead strong guards and spies till all the rite were done
watch from the rising to the setting sun all troy then moves to priam court again a solemn silent melancholy train assembled there from pious toil they rest and sadly shared the last sepulchral feast
we have now passed through the iliad and seen the anger of achilles and the terrible effects of it at an end as that only was the subject of the poem and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to troy and the chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it
i need not mention that troy was taken soon after the death of stern_hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse the particulars of which are described by virgil in the second book of the ćneid
achilles fell before troy by the hand of paris by the shot of an arrow in his heel as stern_hector had prophesied at his death lib
such honour ilion to her hero paid and peaceful slept the mighty stern_hector shade concluding note xxii the unfortunate priam was killed by pyrrhus the son of achilles
oilean_ajax after the death of achilles had a contest with ulysses for the armour of vulcan but being defeated in his aim he slew himself through indignation
argive_helen after the death of paris married deiphobus his brother and at the taking of troy betrayed him in order to reconcile herself to great_menelaus her first husband who received her again into favour
agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by ćgysthus at the instigation of clytemnestra his wife who in his absence had dishonoured his bed with ćgysthus
diomed after the fall of troy was expelled his own country and scarce escaped with his life from his adulterous wife ćgiale but at last was received by daunus in apulia and shared his kingdom it is uncertain how he died
ulysses also after innumerable troubles by sea and land at last returned in safety to ithaca which is the subject of homer odyssey

it may be remarked that the character of thersites revolting and contemptible as it is serves admirably to develop the disposition of ulysses in a new light in which mere cunning is less prominent
of the gradual and individual development of homer hero schlegel well observes in bas relief the figures are usually in profile and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief they are not grouped together but follow one another so homer hero advance one by one in succession before us
it has been remarked that the iliad is not definitively closed but that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it
the bas relief is equally without limit and may be continued ad infinitum either from before or behind on which account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension sacrificial processions dances and line of combatants and hence they also exhibit bas reliefs on curved surfaces such as vases or the frieze of a rotunda where by the curvature the two ends are withdrawn from our sight and where while we advance one object appears as another disappears
reading homer is very much like such a circuit the present object alone arresting our attention we lose sight of what precedes and do not concern ourselves about what is to follow dramatic literature
there cannot be a clearer indication than this description so graphic in the original poem of the true character of the homeric agora
the fate which awaits a presumptuous critic even where his virulent reproaches are substantially well founded is plainly set forth in the treatment of thersites while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even more by the excessive pain which homer takes to heap upon him repulsive personal deformities than by the chastisement of odysseus he is lame bald crook backed of misshapen head and squinting vision grote vol

scamander or scamandros was a river of troas rising according to strabo on the highest part of mount ida in the same hill with the granicus and the oedipus and falling into the sea at sigaeum everything tends to identify it with mendere as wood rennell and other maintain the mendere is miles long foot broad deep in the time of flood nearly dry in the summer

the catalogue is perhaps the portion of the poem in favour of which a claim to separate authorship has been most plausibly urged
although the example of homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the force engaged a common practice in epic poem descriptive of great warlike adventures still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required nor perhaps such as would in ordinary cases suggest itself to the mind of a poet
yet there is scarcely any portion of the iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period with the remainder of the work
the composition of the catalogue whensoever it may have taken place necessarily presumes its author acquaintance with a previously existing iliad
it were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper name most of them historically unimportant and not a few altogether fictitious or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred line and incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety but through the medium of the iliad mure language and literature of greece vol
thucydides observes that the boeotian vessel which carried one hundred and twenty man each were probably meant to be the largest in the fleet and those of philoctetes carrying fifty each the smallest

in short we have in the homeric descriptions the complete picture of an indian or african war canoe many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those of the greeks

accordingly in the battle previous to the eighth book no allusion occurs to a rampart in all those which follow it form a prominent feature

hygin fab ciii tzetz on lycophr there is a most elegant tribute to his memory in the preface to the heroica of philostratus
his best beloved the following elegant remarks of thirlwall greece vol i seq well illustrate the character of the friendship subsisting between these two hero
one of the noblest and most amiable side of the greek character is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and durable friendships and this is a feature no less prominent in the earliest than in later time
it was indeed connected with the comparatively low estimation in which female society was held but the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained was not the less admirable and engaging
the heroic companions whom we find celebrated partly by homer and partly in traditions which if not of equal antiquity were grounded on the same feeling seem to have but one heart and soul with scarcely a wish or object apart and only to live as they are always ready to die for one another
it is true that the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality but this is a circumstance which while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical description detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it presents
such were the friendships of hercules and iolaus of theseus and pirithous of orestes and pylades and though these may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even dramatic poetry the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the period to which the traditions are referred
the argument of the iliad mainly turns on the affection of achilles for patroclus whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and his unequalled prowess
but the mutual regard which united idomeneus and meriones diomedes and sthenelus though as the persons themselves are less important it is kept more in the back ground is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light
the idea of a greek hero seems not to have been thought complete without such a brother in arm by his side thirlwall greece vol

we discover one important truth unconsciously involved which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent age
no distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune the will of the father of god and man is absolute and uncontrollable
this seems to be the true character of the homeric deity and it is very necessary that the student of greek literature should bear it constantly in mind
a strong instance in the iliad itself to illustrate this position is the passage where jupiter laments to juno the approaching death of sarpedon
says he since it is fated moira that sarpedon dearest to me of man should be slain by patroclus the son of menoetius
indeed my heart is divided within me while i ruminate it in my mind whether having snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle i should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his own lycia or whether i should now destroy him by the hand of the son of menoetius
zeus or jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent alas me to which juno answers dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man long since destined by fate palai pepromenon
here it is clear from both speakers that although sarpedon is said to be fated to die jupiter might still if he pleased save him and place him entirely out of the reach of any such event and further in the alternative that jupiter himself would destroy him by the hand of another coleridge

in the wide circle of the shield were seen refulgent images of various form the work of vulcan who had there described the heaven the ether and the earth and sea
in different stations and you there might view the stars that gem the still revolving heaven and under them the vast expanse of air in which with outstretch wing the long beak bird winnow the gale as if instinct with life
may here be introduced the wind the cloud the moon the sun apart around the shield the wave of ocean flow
the realm of tethys which unnumber stream in azure mazes rolling er the earth seem to augment on seat of stone
several of the old northern sagas represent the old man assembled for the purpose of judging as sitting on great stone in a circle called the urtheilsring or gerichtsring grote ii

inciting man and fury breathing flame nor absent were the fate and the tall shape of ghastly death round whom did battle throng their limb distilling plenteous blood and sweat and gorgons whose long locks were twisting snakes
that shot their forky tongues incessant forth such were the horror of dire war dyce calaber a field deep furrowed
here was a corn field reapers in a row each with a sharp tooth sickle in his hand work busily and as the harvest fell other were ready still to bind the sheaves
the steers were moving sturdy bullocks here the plough were drawing and the furrow glebe was black behind them while with goading wand
yoked to a wain that bore the corn away the active youth impell them here a feast was graved to the shrill pipe and ringing lyre
coleridge greek classic poet seq has diligently compared this with the description of the shield of hercules by hesiod
he remarks that with two or three exceptions the imagery differs in little more than the name and arrangements and the difference of arrangement in the shield of hercules is altogether for the worse
the natural consecution of the homeric images needs no exposition it constitutes in itself one of the beauty of the work
the hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or congruity mars and pallas are awkwardly introduced among the centaurs and lapithae but the gap is wide indeed between them and apollo with the muses waking the echoes of olympus to celestial harmonies whence however we are hurried back to perseus the gorgons and other images of war over an arm of the sea in which the sporting dolphins the fugitive fishes and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net are minutely represented
as to the hesiodic images themselves the leading remark is that they catch at beauty by ornament and at sublimity by exaggeration and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this poem there is this curious peculiarity
that in the description of scene of rustic peace the superiority of homer is decisive while in those of war and tumult it may be thought perhaps that the hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage
this legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in the grecian mythology it explains according to the religious ideas familiar to the old epic poet both the distinguishing attributes and the endless toil and endurances of heracles the most renowned subjugator of all the semi divine personages worshipped by the hellenes a being of irresistible force and especially beloved by zeus yet condemned constantly to labour for other and to obey the command of a worthless and cowardly persecutor
his recompense is reserved to the close of his career when his afflicting trials are brought to a close he is then admitted to the godhead and receives in marriage hebe grote vol

ćneas and antenor stand distinguished from the other trojans by a dissatisfaction with priam and a sympathy with the greeks which is by sophocles and other construed as treacherous collusion a suspicion indirectly glanced at though emphatically repelled in the ćneas of virgil grote i_

euripides virgil and other relate that polydore was sent into thrace to the house of polymestor for protection being the youngest of priam son and that he was treacherously murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sent with him
perhaps the boldest excursion of homer into this region of poetical fancy is the collision into which in the twenty first of the iliad he has brought the river god scamander first with achilles and afterwards with vulcan when summoned by juno to the hero aid
the overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation in the character of the mountain torrents of greece and asia minor
on polydore their wide shingly bed are in summer comparatively dry so as to be easily forded by the foot passenger
but a thunder shower in the mountain unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river
yet the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment when the hero destruction appeared imminent might by a slight extension of the figurative parallel be ascribed to a god symbolic of the influences opposed to all atmospheric moisture mure vol

after chasing the trojans into the town he was slain by an arrow from the quiver of paris directed under the unerring auspices of apollo
the greatest efforts were made by the trojans to possess themselves of the body which was however rescued and borne off to the grecian camp by the valour of oilean_ajax and ulysses
thetis stole away the body just as the greeks were about to burn it with funeral honour and conveyed it away to a renewed life of immortality in the isle of leuke in the euxine
it is amusing that plato who often finds fault with homer without reason should have copied this twaddling etymology into his cratylus
this book has been closely imitated by virgil in his fifth book but it is almost useless to attempt a selection of passage for comparison
such was his fate astyanax i the city king or guardian thrice in order led this was a frequent rite at funerals

by a close study of life and by a true and natural mode of expressing everything homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and difficult situations and to extricate himself from them with the completest success
the whole scene between achilles and priam when the latter comes to the greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of stern_hector is at once the most profoundly skilful and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the iliad
quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of priam the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent that if genius did not often especially in oratory unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism we might be induced on this account alone to consider the last book of the iliad as what is called spurious in other word of later date than the rest of the poem
observe the exquisite taste of priam in occupying the mind of achilles from the outset with the image of his father in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation and lastly mentioning stern_hector name when he perceives that the hero is softened and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror
the ego eleeinoteros per and the apusato aecha geronta are not exactly like the tone of the earlier part of the iliad
dryden in reference to the whole scene that follows the remarks of coleridge are well worth reading they are almost too fine and pathetic
the whole passage defies translation for there is that about the greek which has no name but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in the original and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another language coleridge
achilles ferocious treatment of the corpse of stern_hector cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity the heroic age however must be judged by its own moral laws
retributive vengeance on the dead as well as the living was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous time which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated
hence a denial of the rite essential to the soul admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shore of the infernal river
the complaint of the ghost of patroclus to achilles of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge which even after death was supposed to torment the dwellers in hades
hence before yielding up the body of stern_hector to priam achilles asks pardon of patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution mure vol
i such was the fate of astyanax when troy was taken here from the tow by stern_hector ulysses thrown andromache bewail her infant son
the following observations of coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting view of argive_helen character few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that has given us the fury and inconsistency of achilles gives us also the consummate elegance and tenderness of argive_helen
she is through the iliad a genuine lady graceful in motion and speech noble in her associations full of remorse for a fault for which higher power seem responsible yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had committed her
i have always thought the following speech in which argive_helen laments stern_hector and hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in troy as almost the sweetest passage in the poem
it is another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the iliad from the rest classic poet seq
merrick tryphiodorus and here we part with achilles at the moment best calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his character
we now leave him in repose and under the full influence of the more amiable affections while our admiration of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that within a few short day the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise
the frequent and touching allusions interspersed throughout the iliad to the speedy termination of its hero course and the moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate are among the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of the poem is united mure vol
cowper says i cannot take my leave of this noble poem without expressing how much i am struck with the plain conclusion of it
