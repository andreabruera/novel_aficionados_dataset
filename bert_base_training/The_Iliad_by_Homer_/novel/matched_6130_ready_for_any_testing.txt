to be content with what we at present know is for the most part to shut our ears against conviction since from the very gradual character of our education we must continually forget and emancipate ourselves from knowledge previously acquired we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones and as we learn we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire
and this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice and in which person and things are day by day finding their real level in lieu of their conventional value
the same principles which have swept away traditional abuses and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists and stripping the thin tawdry veil from attractive superstitions are working as actively in literature as in society
the credulity of one writer or the partiality of another finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists as the dreams of conservatism or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the church
history and tradition whether of ancient or comparatively recent times are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow
mere statements are jealously watched and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history as the fact he records
probability is a powerful and troublesome test and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is sifted
funeral of stern_hector introduction scepticism is as much the result of knowledge as knowledge is of scepticism consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demand
in brief to write a history we must know more than mere fact human nature viewed under an induction of extended experience is the best help to the criticism of human history
to form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great whole we must measure them by their relation to the mass of being by whom they are surrounded and in contemplating the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us we must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative than the respective probability of its details
historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human experience whether actual or traditionary has furnished it is unfortunate for us that of some of the greatest men we know least and talk most
homer socrates and shakespere have perhaps contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who could be named and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow
the personality of shakespere is perhaps the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy but upon everything else even down to the authorship of plays there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty
of socrates we know as little as the contradictions of plato and xenophon will allow us to know he was one of the dramatis personae in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style
he appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down
when we have read plato or xenophon we think we know something of socrates when we have fairly read and examined both we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant
it has been an easy and a popular expedient of late years to deny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief
this system which has often comforted the religious sceptic and substituted the consolations of strauss for those of the new testament has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present century
to question the existence of alexander the great would be a more excusable act than to believe in that of romulus
to deny a fact related in herodotus because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way is more pardonable than to believe in the good natured old king whom the elegant pen of florian has idealized numa pompilius
scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to homer and the state of our homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory provided we throw overboard all written tradition concerning the author or authors of the iliad and odyssey
what few authorities exist on the subject are summarily dismissed although the arguments appear to run in a circle this cannot be true because it is not true and that is not true because it cannot be true
such seems to be the style in which testimony upon testimony statement upon statement is consigned to denial and oblivion
it is however unfortunate that the professed biographies of homer are partly forgeries partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination in which truth is the requisite most wanting
before taking a brief review of the homeric theory in its present condition some notice must be taken of the treatise on the life of homer which has been attributed to herodotus
according to this document the city of cumae in ćolia was at an early period the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of greece
among the immigrants was menapolus the son of ithagenes although poor he married and the result of the union was a girl named critheis
the girl was left an orphan at an early age under the guardianship of cleanax of argos it is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we are indebted for so much happiness
homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty and received the name of melesigenes from having been born near the river meles in boeotia whither critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation
at this time continues our narrative there lived at smyrna a man named phemius a teacher of literature and music who not being married engaged critheis to manage his household and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours
so satisfactory was her performance of this task and so modest her conduct that he made proposals of marriage declaring himself as a further inducement willing to adopt her son who he asserted would become a clever man if he were carefully brought up
they were married careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed and melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment and when older rivalled his preceptor in wisdom
melesigenes carried on his adopted father school with great success exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of smyrna but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there especially in the exportation of corn attracted to that city
among these visitors one mentes from leucadia the modern santa maura who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times persuaded melesigenes to close his school and accompany him on his travels
he promised not only to pay his expenses but to furnish him with a further stipend urging that while he was yet young it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses
melesigenes consented and set out with his patron examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met
we may also suppose that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation having set sail from tyrrhenia and iberia they reached ithaca
here melesigenes who had already suffered in his eyes became much worse and mentes who was about to leave for leucadia left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his named mentor the son of alcinor
under his hospitable and intelligent host melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting ulysses which afterwards formed the subject of the odyssey
the inhabitants of ithaca assert that it was here that melesigenes became blind but the colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune
phemius died leaving him sole heir to his property and his mother soon followed he then returned to smyrna where he applied himself to the study of poetry
but poverty soon drove him to cumae having passed over the hermaean plain he arrived at neon teichos the new wall a colony of cumae
and up to my time continued the author the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot
here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one tychias an armourer here also a poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since melesigenes arrived
here the cumans say he composed an epitaph on gordius king of phrygia which has however and with greater probability been attributed to cleobulus of lindus
arrived at cumae he frequented the converzationes of the old men and delighted all by the charms of his poetry
encouraged by this favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a public maintenance he would render their city most gloriously renowned
but poverty still drove him on and he went by way of larissa as being the most convenient road they avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed and procured him an audience in the council
having made the speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal
the greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet demand but one man observed that if they were to feed homers they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people
with a love of economy which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men the pension was denied and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory
from this circumstance says the writer melesigenes acquired the name of homer for the cumans call blind men homers at phocoea homer was destined to experience another literary distress
one thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius kept homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name
having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable thestorides like some would be literary publishers neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him
at his departure homer is said to have observed thestorides of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible than
the human heart homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some chian merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite acquainted him with the fact that thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems
no vessel happened then to be setting sail thither but he found one ready to start for erythrae a town of ionia which faces that island and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them
having embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of thestorides who by his breach of hospitality had drawn down the wrath of which_jove the hospitable
at erythrae homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in phocoea by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty reached the little hamlet of pithys
this at once determined him to set out for chios here he met with an adventure which we will continue in the word of our author
having set out from pithys homer went on attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing the dogs barked on his approach and he cried out
glaucus for that was the name of the goat herd heard his voice ran up quickly called off his dogs and drove them away from homer
for or some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone and what could be his design in coming
he then went up to him and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spot and of what he stood in need
homer by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup
the dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according to their usual habit whereupon homer addressed glaucus thus glaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest
first give the dogs their supper at the door of the hut for so it is better since whilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold
glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author having finished supper they banqueted afresh on conversation homer narrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited
at length they retired to rest but on the following morning glaucus resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting with homer
having arrived at bolissus a place near the farm and finding his mate he told him the whole story respecting homer and his journey
he paid little attention to what he said and blamed glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled person
having left the goats in charge of a fellow servant he left homer at home promising to return quickly however he bade him bring the stranger to him
glaucus told homer what had taken place and bade him follow him assuring him that good fortune would be the result
conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge and the chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake the charge of his children
besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor thestorides from the island homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher in the town of chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry
to this day says chandler the most curious remain is that which has been named without reason the school of homer
it is on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open temple of cybele formed on the top of a rock
the shape is oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess the head and an arm wanting
she is represented as usual sitting the chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back the area is bounded by a low rim or seat and about five yards over
the whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity so successful was this school that homer realised a considerable fortune
the following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet which has already been mentioned
in his poetical compositions homer displays great gratitude towards mentor of ithaca in the odyssey whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of ulysses in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness
he married and had two daughters one of whom died single the other married a chian he also testifies his gratitude to phemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction
having it is said made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention he sent out for samos
here being recognized by a samian who had met with him in chios he was handsomely received and invited to join in celebrating the apaturian festival
he recited some verses which gave great satisfaction and by singing the eiresione at the new moon festivals he earned a subsistence visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was very popular
in the spring he sailed for athens and arrived at the island of ios now ino where he fell extremely ill and died
it is said that his death arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermen children
such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of homer we possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail
let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering patient and learned but by no means consistent series of investigations has led
his celebrity continued to increase and many person advised him to visit greece whither his reputation had now extended in doing so i profess to bring forward statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability
the history of this poet and his works is lost in doubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness
the majestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the nile through many lands and nations and like the sources of the nile its fountains will ever remain concealed
such are the word in which one of the most judicious german critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the homeric question is involved
with no less truth and feeling he proceeds it seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible
homer appeared if the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light
the creations of genius always seem like miracles because they are for the most part created far out of the reach of observation
if we were in possession of all the historical testimonies we never could wholly explain the origin of the iliad and the odyssey for their origin in all essential points must have remained the secret of the poet
from this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire drawings of scholastic investigation let us pass on to the main question at issue
was homer an individual or were the iliad and odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets
well has landor remarked some tell us there were twenty homers some deny that there was ever one it were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase in order to let them settle at last
we are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure our devotion to superior power of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us
my opinion is that what is best for us is our admiration of good no man living venerates homer more than i do
but greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulty with which the homeric question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period to prefer his judgment to his imagination and to condescend to dry details
before however entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the homeric poems at least of the iliad i must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks
we cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better the poetic age of greece almost conclusive testimony to its original composition
it was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question nor is it injustice to assert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole
the most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame and we would take the opinion of chantrey or westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form rather than that of mr brodie or sir astley cooper
there is some truth though some malicious exaggeration in the lines of pope the critic eye that microscope of wit
sees hairs and pores examines bit by bit how parts relate to parts or they to whole the body harmony the beaming soul are things which kuster burmann wasse shall see when man whole frame is obvious to a flea
long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems
the grave and cautious thucydides quoted without hesitation the hymn to apollo the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics
longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the odyssey to the iliad and among a mass of ancient authors whose very names it would be tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal non existence of homer ever arose
so far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim
at the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on the subject and we find bentley remarking that homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and good cheer at festivals and other days of merriment
these loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about peisistratus time about five hundred years after
two french writers hedelin and perrault avowed a similar scepticism on the subject but it is in the scienza nuova of battista vico that we first meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by wolf with so much learning and acuteness
indeed it is with the wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following bold hypothesis which we will detail in the word of grote
half a century ago the acute and valuable prolegomena of a wolf turning to account the venetian scholia which had then been recently published first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the homeric text
a considerable part of that dissertation though by no means the whole is employed in vindicating the position previously announced by bentley amongst others that the separate constituent portion of the iliad and odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order until the days of peisistratus in the sixth century before christ
as a step towards that conclusion wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times to which their composition is referred and that without writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him transmitted with assurance to posterity
the absence of easy and convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts among the early greeks was thus one of the points in wolf case against the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey
by nitzsch and other leading opponents of wolf the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the iliad and odyssey to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning
to me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by wolf to peisistratus and his associates in reference to the homeric poems are nowise admissible
but much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems in the ninth century before the christian aera
few things in my opinion can be more improbable and mr payne knight opposed as he is to the wolfian hypothesis admits this no less than wolf himself
we have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth olympiad and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed nor can we even assure ourselves whether archilochus simonides of amorgus kallinus tyrtaeus xanthus and the other early elegiac and lyric poets committed their compositions to writing or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar
the first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of homer is in the famous ordinance of solon with regard to the rhapsodies at the panathenaea but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed we are unable to say
those who maintain the homeric poems to have been written from the beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry for they admit generally that the iliad and odyssey were not read but recited and heard but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy
but here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater for the existence of trained bards gifted with extraordinary memory
is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts in an age essentially non reading and non writing and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious
moreover there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript for if such had been the fact blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession which we know that it was not as well from the example of demodokus in the odyssey as from that of the blind bard of chios in the hymn to the delian apollo whom thucydides as well as the general tenor of grecian legend identifies with homer himself
the author of that hymn be he who he may could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest
the traces of writing in greece even in the seventh century before the christian aera are exceedingly trifling
the loss of the digamma that crux of critics that quicksand upon which even the acumen of bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyond a doubt that the pronunciation of the greek language had undergone a considerable change
now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the homeric poems could have suffered by this change had written copies been preserved
if chaucer poetry for instance had not been written it could only have come down to us in a softened form more like the effeminate version of dryden than the rough quaint noble original
at what period continues grote these poems or indeed any other greek poems first began to be written must be matter of conjecture though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of solon
if in the absence of evidence we may venture upon naming any more determinate period the question a once suggests itself what were the purposes which in that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer
not for the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the memory but also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice pauses and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce
not for the general public they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival
the only person for whom the written iliad would be suitable would be a select few studious and curious men a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the written word realize in their imagination a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter
incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present there is in all early societies and there was in early greece a time when no such reading class existed
if we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing
now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in greece is the middle of the seventh century before the christian aera c to c the age of terpander kallinus archilochus simonides of amorgus
i ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of grecian poetry and music the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rival to the primitive hexameter and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life
such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable yet
it argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from their own individual point of view the written word of the homeric rhapsodies just as we are told that kallinus both noticed and eulogized the thebais as the production of homer
there seems therefore ground for conjecturing that for the use of this newly formed and important but very narrow class manuscripts of the homeric poems and other old epics the thebais and the cypria as well as the iliad and the odyssey began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century c and the opening of egypt to grecian commerce which took place about the same period would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon
a reading class when once formed would doubtless slowly increase and the number of manuscripts along with it so that before the time of solon fifty years afterwards both readers and manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained a certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes
but even peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations
there are several incidental circumstance which in our opinion throw some suspicion over the whole history of the peisistratid compilation at least over the theory that the iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the athenian ruler
for whom was a written iliad necessary the nearest approaching to the sense if the great poets who flourished at the bright period of grecian song of which alas
we have inherited little more than the fame and the faint echo if stesichorus anacreon and simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the iliad and odyssey so much must have been done to arrange to connect to harmonize that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of athenian manufacture should not remain
whatever occasional anomalies may be detected anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the homeric age however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our bentleys to whom the name of argive_helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age however mr knight may have failed in reducing the homeric language to its primitive form however finally the attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics still it is difficult to suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression
it is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original as sir walter scott has done in his continuation of sir tristram
if however not even such faint and indistinct traces of athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems the total absence of athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation
in later and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times the athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors
but amid all the tradition of the glories of early greece embodied in the iliad the athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part
it is possible indeed that in its leading outline the iliad may be true to historic fact that in the great maritime expedition of western greece against the rival and half kindred empire of the laomedontiadae the chieftain of thessaly from his valour and the number of his forces may have been the most important ally of the peloponnesian sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the athenians to yield to their taste
the songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and popularity or at first sight a theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an athenian synod of compilers of ancient song than an achilleid or an olysseid
even the few passages which relate to their ancestors mr knight suspects to be interpolations could france have given birth to a tasso tancred would have been the hero of the jerusalem
if however the homeric ballads as they are sometimes called which related the wrath of achilles with all its direful consequences were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle as to admit no rivalry it is still surprising that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an athenian hand and that the national spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours the french should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors or at least to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age
while it is to be confessed that wolf objections to the primitive integrity of the iliad and odyssey have never been wholly got over we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the difficulty with which the whole subject is beset are rather augmented than otherwise if we admit his hypothesis
he divides the first twenty two books of the iliad into sixteen different songs and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of peisistratus
to return to the wolfian theory nor is lachmann modification of his theory any better this as grote observes explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else
moreover we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the so called sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the secession of achilles
elphenor chief of the euboeans tlepolemus of the rhodians pandarus of the lycians odius of the halizonians pirous and acamas of the thracians
none of these heroes again make their appearance and we can but agree with colonel mure that it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel
the discrepancy by which pylaemenes who is represented as dead in the fifth book weeps at his son funeral in the thirteenth can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation
grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the wolfian theory and of lachmann modifications with the character of peisistratus
but he has also shown and we think with equal success that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems or supposing that impossible the unison of these parts by peisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct
in short a man may believe the iliad to have been put together out of pre existing songs without recognising the age of peisistratus as the period of its first compilation
the friends or literary employes of peisistratus must have found an iliad that was already ancient and the silence of the alexandrine critics respecting the peisistratic recension goes far to prove that among the numerous manuscripts they examined this was either wanting or thought unworthy of attention
there is nothing either in the iliad or odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age of peisistratus nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two century in the greek language the coined money the habits of writing and reading the despotisms and republican governments the close military array the improved construction of ships the amphiktyonic convocations the mutual frequentation of religious festivals the oriental and egyptian veins of religion familiar to the latter epoch
these alterations onomakritus and the other literary friends of peisistratus could hardly have failed to notice even without design had they then for the first time undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate
everything in the two great homeric poems both in substance and in language belongs to an age two or three century earlier than peisistratus
indeed even the interpolations or those passages which on the best grounds are pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before christ and may well have been heard by archilochus and kallinus in some cases even by arktinus and hesiod as genuine homeric matter
as far as the evidences on the case as well internal as external enable us to judge we seem warranted in believing that the iliad and odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand always allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations in c our first trustworthy mark of grecian time and this ancient date let it be added as it is the best authenticated fact so it is also the most important attribute of the homeric poems considered in reference to grecian history for they thus afford us an insight into the anti historical character of the greeks enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition
on the whole i am inclined to believe that the labours of peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although i must confess that i can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours
at the same time so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems in their present form was the work of peisistratus i am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems rather than to patch and re construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis
i will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author
moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked suffice it to say that the more we read the less satisfied we are upon either subject
i cannot however help thinking that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to lycurgus is little else than a version of the same story as that of peisistratus while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the spartan confucius
i will conclude this sketch of the homeric theories with an attempt made by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like consistency
no doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common sailors of some fifty years ago some one qualified to discourse in excellent music among them
many of these like those of the negroes in the united states were extemporaneous and allusive to events passing around them
the grand events of a spirit stirring war occurrences likely to impress themselves as the mystical legends of former times had done upon their memory besides which a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times
it is as follows but what was passing around them ballads at first and down to the beginning of the war with troy were merely recitations with an intonation
then followed a species of recitative probably with an intoned burden tune next followed as it aided the memory considerably
it was at this period about four hundred years after the war that a poet flourished of the name of melesigenes or moeonides but most probably the former
he saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of hellas and as a collection he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own
the author however did not affix his own name to the poem which in fact was great part of it remodelled from the archaic dialect of crete in which tongue the ballads were found by him
he therefore called it the poem of homeros or the collector but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people ideas for as grote has finely observed arguing for the unity of authorship a great poet might have re cast pre existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so
this poem now exists under the title of the odyssea while employed on the wild legend of odysseus he met with a ballad recording the quarrel of achilles and agamemnon
unity of design however caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together like those relating to the cid into a chronicle history named the iliad
melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved but first the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions by the people who took to singing them in the streets assembly and agoras
however solon first and then peisistratus and afterwards aristoteles and others revised the poems and restored the works of melesigenes homeros to their original integrity in a great measure
having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject i must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the homeric poems
to deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist would be an absurd and captious assumption but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoy these poems
his noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself and the achilleis grew under his hand in maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author be he homer or melesigenes quocunque
i feel conscious that while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors the most powerful internal evidence and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul also speaks eloquently to the contrary
nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit the minutiae of verbal criticism i am far from seeking to despise indeed considering the character of some of my own books such an attempt would be gross inconsistency
but while i appreciate its importance in a philological view i am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic value especially in poetry
three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations some of which had they been suggested to the author by his maecenas or africanus he would probably have adopted
moreover those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation are often least competent to carry out their own precepts
i do not at this moment remember two emendations on homer calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage although a mass of remarks from herodotus down to loewe have given us the history of a thousand minute points without which our greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune
grammarians are not poets by profession but may be so per accidens but it is not on word only that grammarians mere grammarians will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity
binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his word and sentences they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything
but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out book after book passage after passage till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments or till those who fancied they possessed the works of some great man find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand
if we compare the theories of knight wolf lachmann and others we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of homer
one rejects what another considers the turning point of his theory one cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else
justus lipsius a scholar of no ordinary skill seems to revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies attributed to seneca are by four different authors
now i will venture to assert that these tragedies are so uniform not only in their borrowed phraseology a phraseology with which writers like boethius and saxo grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves in their freedom from real poetry and last but not least in an ultra refined and consistent abandonment of good taste that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman be he seneca or not to produce not only these but a great many more equally bad
with equal sagacity father hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the ćneid of virgil and the satires of horace were literary deceptions
now without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning nay the refined acuteness which scholars like wolf have bestowed upon this subject i must express my fears that many of our modern homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity
nor can i help thinking that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the iliad and odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation
i have already expressed my belief that the labours of peisistratus were of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of homer may not have been abroad in his day than that the poems of valerius flaccus and tibullus should have given so much trouble to poggio scaliger and others
but after all the main fault in all the homeric theories is that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals and which are its most fitting judges
the ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of homer does too much violence to that inward emotion which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of chios
to believe the author of the iliad a mere compiler is to degrade the powers of human invention to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus
nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty there is a catholicity so to speak in the very name of homer
our faith in the author of the iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has taught us a better
while however i look upon the belief in homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring while i can join with old ennius in believing in homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hovers round the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust still
i am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition a well stocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and embellishment
but it is one thing to use existing romances in the embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem itself from such materials
what consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt or rather what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result
a blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other bards are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality
in fact the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions nay even his own thought are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination
but unless there be some grand pervading principle some invisible yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole a poem like the iliad can never come to the birth
local associations teeming with the thought of gods and great men may crowd in one mighty vision or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have nought but a scrap book a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento of rags and tatters which will require little acuteness to detect
sensible as i am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and aware as i must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief it still seems to me that the homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained
we are not by nature intended to know all things still less to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal
tradition the most picturesque episodes the most pathetic were faith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why god willed our ignorance on any matter
but we are too well taught the contrary lesson and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity
and there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter
long and habitual reading of homer appears to familiarize our thought even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spot which mere analysis can discover
in reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being we in imagination must fight over the same battles woo the same loves burn with the same sense of injury as an achilles or a stern_hector
and if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of homer we shall feel that the poems of homer are not only the work of one writer but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song
and it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old
heeren who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely observes it was homer who formed the character of the greek nation
prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the character of other nations it was reserved to a poet to form that of the greeks
no poet has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his countrymen this is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy
when lawgivers and sages appeared in greece the work of the poet had already been accomplished and they paid homage to his superior genius
he held up before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals and to behold them reflected with purity and truth
his poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature on the love of children wife and country on that passion which outweighs all others the love of glory
his songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man and therefore they enter and will continue to enter every breast which cherishes the same sympathies
if it is granted to his immortal spirit from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the nations from the fields of asia to the forests of hercynia performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand of elevated of glorious productions which had been called into being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may reside this alone would suffice to complete his happiness
can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the apotheosis of homer is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition
the more we read and the more we think think as becomes the readers of homer the more rooted becomes the conviction that the father of poetry gave us this rich inheritance whole and entire
whatever were the means of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other
as the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to homer are not included in pope translation i will content myself with a brief account of the battle of the frogs and mice from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice this poem says coleridge is a short mock heroic of ancient date
the text varies in different editions and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of homer genius others have attributed it to the same pigrees mentioned above and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit the author of which was uncertain so little did the greeks before the age of the ptolemies know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings
as to this little poem being a youthful prolusion of homer it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody not only of the general spirit but of the numerous passages of the iliad itself and even if no such intention to parody were discernible in it the objection would still remain that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste which the history of every other people in europe and of many in asia has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the iliad that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind attributed for aught we can see with as much reason to homer is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the homeric age
knight infers from the usage of the word deltos writing tablet instead of diphthera skin which according to herod was the material employed by the asiatic greeks for that purpose that this poem was another offspring of attic ingenuity and generally that the familiar mention of the cock is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition
having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in pope design i will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation and on my own purpose in the present edition
pope was not a grecian his whole education had been irregular and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of ogilby
it is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language
there are to be sure certain conventional anecdotes which prove that pope consulted various friends whose classical attainments were sounder than his own during the undertaking but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original
hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation and in those days what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present
if something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet meaning his word were less jealously sought for and those who could read so good a poem as pope iliad had fair reason to be satisfied
we must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itself a work which is as much a part of english literature as homer himself is of greek
we must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old iliad that once was our most cherished companion or our most looked for prize merely because buttmann loewe and liddell have made us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being an adjective and not a substantive
far be it from us to defend the faults of pope especially when we think of chapman fine bold rough old english far be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation of homer might be
but we can still dismiss pope iliad to the hands of our readers with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow
as to the note accompanying the present volume they are drawn up without pretension and mainly with the view of helping the general reader
having some little time since translated all the works of homer for another publisher i might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter sometimes of a critical character to bear upon the text
but pope version was no field for such a display and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions to notice occasionally some departures from the original and to give a few parallel passages from our english homer milton
in the latter task i cannot pretend to novelty but i trust that my other annotations while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views will be found to convey as much as is wanted at least as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit
to write a commentary on homer is not my present aim but if i have made pope translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers i shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished
it would be absurd therefore to test pope translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text theodore alois buckley
pope preface to the iliad of homer homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever
the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences but his invention remains yet unrivalled
nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry
it is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses the utmost stretch of human study learning and industry which masters everything besides can never attain to this
it furnishes art with all her materials and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature
whatever praises may be given to works of judgment there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute as in the most regular gardens art can only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity and such a figure which the common eye may better take in and is therefore more entertained with
and perhaps the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature
our author work is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater
it is like a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify
if some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature
it is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in homer that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him
what he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every thing lives and is put in action
if a council be called or a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poet imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a spectator
the course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes hoid ar isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito
it is however remarkable that his fancy which is everywhere vigorous is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and others and becomes on fire like a chariot wheel by its own rapidity
exact disposition just thought correct elocution polished numbers may have been found in a thousand but this poetic fire this vivida vis animi in a very few
even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected this can overpower criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove
nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour
this fire is discerned in virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected from homer more shining than fierce but everywhere equal and constant in lucan and statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted flashes
in milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art in shakspeare it strikes before we are aware like an accidental fire from heaven but in homer and in him only it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly
i shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors
this strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star which in the violence of its course drew all things within its vortex
it seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the whole compass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections all the inward passions and affections of mankind to furnish his characters and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable
that which aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into it by homer i shall begin with considering him in his part as it is naturally the first and i speak of it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction
christ church they pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the marvellous
the probable fable is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such as though they did became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them
of this sort is the main story of an epic poem the return of ulysses the settlement of the trojans in italy or the like
that of the iliad is the anger of achilles the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet
yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events and crowded with a greater number of councils speeches battles and episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity
the action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days
virgil for want of so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both homer poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his
the other epic poets have used the same practice but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time
nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story
if he has funeral games for patroclus virgil has the same for anchises and statius rather than omit them destroys the unity of his actions for those of archemorus
if he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their forces in the same order if ulysses visit the shades the ćneas of virgil and scipio of silius are sent after him
if he be detained from his return by the allurements of calypso so is ćneas by dido and rinaldo by armida
if achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account
virgil has not only observed this close imitation of homer but where he had not led the way supplied the want from other greek authors
thus the story of sinon and the taking of troy was copied says macrobius almost word for word from pisander as the loves of dido and ćneas are taken from those of medea and jason in apollonius and several others in the same manner
to proceed to the allegorical fable if we reflect upon those innumerable knowledge those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us
how fertile will that imagination appear which as able to clothe all the properties of elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in forms and person and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed
this is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with homer and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it
for when the mode of learning changed in the following ages and science was delivered in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside as it was in homer to make use of it
and perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for virgil that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem
if he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour virgil and tasso make the same present to theirs the marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the machines of the gods
if homer was not the first who introduced the deities as herodotus imagines into the religion of greece he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods constantly laying their accusation against homer as the chief support of it
but whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various changes of times and religions his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry
we come now to the characters of his person and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them
every one has something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features than the poet has by their manners
nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices the single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the iliad
that of achilles is furious and intractable that of diomede forward yet listening to advice and subject to command that of oilean_ajax is heavy and self confiding of stern_hector active and vigilant the courage of agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition that of great_menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people we find in idomeneus a plain direct soldier in sarpedon a gallant and generous one
nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character but even in the under parts of it to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one
for example the main characters of ulysses and wise_nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct in this that the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other natural open and regular
but they have besides characters of courage and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other upon experience
the characters of virgil are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of homer
his characters of valour are much alike even that of turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the courage of mnestheus from that of sergestus cloanthus or the rest
in like manner it may be remarked of statius heroes that an air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage courage appears in his capaneus tydeus hippomedon
it would be endless to produce instances of these kinds they have a parity of character which makes them seem brothers of one family
i believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of homer was to that of all others
the speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those who utter them
as there is more variety of characters in the iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem
everything in it has manner as aristotle expresses it that is everything is acted or spoken it is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a number of lines are employed in narration
in virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thought which might be equally just in any person mouth upon the same occasion
as many of his person have no apparent characters so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety
we oftener think of the author himself when we read virgil than when we are engaged in homer all which are the effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action described
if in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thought
homer makes us hearers and virgil leaves us readers longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part homer principally excelled
what were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the scripture
and it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that if virgil has not so many thought that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the roman author seldom rise into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad
duport in his gnomologia homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort if we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the invention still predominant
to what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various views presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat
nay he not only gives us the full prospects of things but several unexpected peculiarities and side views unobserved by any painter but homer
nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles which take up no less than half the iliad and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another such different kinds of deaths that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rise above the last in greatness horror and confusion
it is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is evident of virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master
if we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination of homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it
his expression is like the colouring of some great masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity
we acknowledge him the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the gods to men it is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with the greatest spirit
aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who had found out living word there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever
an arrow is impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it
it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rise with it and forms itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense
this was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images
on this last consideration i cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention since as he has managed them
to throw his language more out of prose homer seems to have affected the compound epithets they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the person or things to which they were joined
we see the motion of stern_hector plumes in the epithet korythaiolos the landscape of mount neritus in that of einosiphyllos and so of others which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure
lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also
he was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of greece but searched through its different dialects with this particular view to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength
what he most affected was the ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables so as to make the word open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency
with this he mingled the attic contractions the broader doric and the feebler ćolic which often rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry
thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified
out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in the world
this is so great a truth that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of italian operas will find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other language of poetry
the beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by virgil himself though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the latin tongue indeed the greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its word and the turn and cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language
virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense
if the grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the roman the only reason is that fewer critics have understood one language than the other
dionysius of halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author beauties in this kind in his treatise of the composition of word
it suffices at present to observe of his numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine
homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet
they roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while we are borne away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable
as a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets is a short description thus on whatever side we contemplate homer what principally strikes us is his invention
it is that which forms the character of each part of his work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other his manners more lively and strongly marked his speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his expression more raised and daring and his numbers more rapid and various
i hope in what has been said of virgil with regard to any of these heads i have no way derogated from his character
nothing is more absurd or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole
we ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him
no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty and as homer has done this in invention virgil has in judgment
not that we are to think that homer wanted judgment because virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that virgil wanted invention because homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have less in comparison with one another
homer was the greater genius virgil the better artist in one we most admire the man in the other the work
virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out his riches with a boundless overflow
homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream
homer boundless and resistless as achilles bears all before him and shines more and more as the tumult increases virgil calmly daring like ćneas appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity
and when we look upon their machines homer seems like his own jupiter in his terrors shaking olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens
virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for empires and regularly ordering his whole creation
but after all it is with great parts as with great virtues they naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue end or the fault begins
as prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness
if we look upon homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty
among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon which so much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of probability
perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with gigantic bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to become miracles in the whole and like the old heroes of that make commit something near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances
thus homer has his speaking horses and virgil his myrtles distilling blood where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability
when we behold their battles methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate it is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstance
the force of this faculty is seen in nothing more than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one
his similes are like pictures where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects
the same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images
if there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in
such are his grosser representations of the gods and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes but i must here speak a word of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by the censurers and defenders of homer
it must be a strange partiality to antiquity to think with madame dacier that those times and manners are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours
who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages when a spirit of revenge and cruelty joined with the practice of rapine and robbery reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword and their wife and daughters made slave and concubines
on the other side i would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of homer engaged
there is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages in beholding monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the springs
when we read homer we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in the perusal of him
let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found the only true mirror of that ancient world
the reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind by this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their dislike will become a satisfaction
this consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the far darting phoebus the blue eyed pallas the swift footed achilles which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated
those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions and which it was an irreverence to omit
boileau is of opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such for the greeks having no names derived from their fathers were obliged to add some other distinction of each person either naming his parents expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as alexander the son of philip herodotus of halicarnassus diogenes the cynic
as for the epithets of great men mons homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry
and indeed we have something parallel to these in modern times such as the names of harold harefoot edmund ironside edward longshanks edward the black prince
if yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition i shall add a further conjecture
hesiod dividing the world into its different ages has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one of heroes distinct from other men a divine race who fought at thebes and troy are called demi gods and live by the care of jupiter in the islands of the blessed
now among the divine honours which were paid them they might have this also in common with the gods not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families actions or qualities
what other cavils have been raised against homer are such as hardly deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work
many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt virgil which is much the same as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as heard of homer having written first a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye
some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the fable and moral of the ćneis to those of the iliad for the same reasons which might set the odyssey above the ćneis as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed as because achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as ćneas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character it is thus that rapin judges in his comparison of homer and virgil
others select those particular passages of homer which are not so laboured as some that virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of scaliger in his poetics
others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of perrault in his parallels
lastly there are others who pretending to a fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of homer and that of his work but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his times and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the cities
the same might as well be said of virgil or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation
to be the causes of his fame which were in reality the consequences of his merit this is the method of mons
who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age homer had lived he must have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him
in all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself remains unequalled by his followers he still continues superior to them
a cooler judgment may commit fewer faults and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment
homer not only appears the inventor of poetry but excels all the inventors of other arts in this that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him
he showed all the stretch of fancy at once and if he has failed in some of his flights it was but because he attempted everything
a work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rise from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit nature and art conspire to raise it pleasure and profit join to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance
having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original it remains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief characteristic
as far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem such as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions
as it also breaks out in every particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief character
it is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed and for the rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them
it should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the greek
it is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manners of expression
if there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal
i know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and i will venture to say there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author
it is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place
it is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps
where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere english critic
nothing that belongs to homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity
i see these different followers of homer some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain signs of false mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his train while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them
however of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his friends must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world will call dulness
there is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bold and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dressed at all
de la mott what he has done admitted no increase it only left room for contraction or regulation methinks simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity
this pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the scripture and our author one may affirm with all respect to the inspired writings that the divine spirit made use of no other word
but what were intelligible and common to men at that time and in that part of the world and as homer is the author nearest to those his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer
this consideration together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thought may methinks induce a translator on the one hand to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the old testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the divinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion
for a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet
they have something venerable and as i may say oracular in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase
perhaps the mixture of some graecisms and old word after the manner of milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast
but certainly the use of modern terms of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like into which some of his translators have fallen cannot be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language
there are two peculiarities in homer diction which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who are seemed pleased with them as beauties
i speak of his compound epithets and of his repetitions many of the former cannot be done literally into english without destroying the purity of our language
i believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an english compound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets and are become familiar through their use of them such as the cloud compelling which_jove
as for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one the course to be taken is obvious
some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two word may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leaf shaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods
others that admit of different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced
for example the epithet of apollo hekaebolos or far shooting is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such places where apollo is represented as a god in person i would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described i would make choice of the latter
upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in homer and which though it might be accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those times is by no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment
as for homer repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or hemistitch
i hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other
the repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his word as in the messages from gods to men or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemn forms of prayers oaths or the like
in other cases i believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any if they be tedious the author is to answer for it
it only remains to speak of the versification homer as has been said is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new subject
this is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry and attainable by very few i only know of homer eminent for it in the greek and virgil in the latin
i am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fully possessed of his image however it may reasonably be believed they designed this in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others
few readers have the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see i have endeavoured at this beauty
i attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done
upon the whole i must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to homer we have only those of chapman hobbes and ogilby
chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his
he has frequent interpolations of four or six lines and i remember one in the thirteenth book of the odyssey ver
he is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other places of his note insist so much upon verbal trifles
he appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in homer and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end
his expression is involved in fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as in the tragedy of bussy amboise
in a word the nature of the man may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in poetry
his own boast of having finished half the iliad in less than fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed
but that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion
hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for particulars and circumstance he continually lops them and often omits the most beautiful
as for its being esteemed a close translation i doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the contractions above mentioned
he sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen but through carelessness
where he has spun twenty verses out of two his poetry as well as ogilby is too mean for criticism
he has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in
he seems to have had too much regard to chapman whose word he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original
however had he translated the whole work i would no more have attempted homer after him than virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation i know in any language
but the fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it
that which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character in particular places where the sense can bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers to preserve in the more active or descriptive parts a warmth and elevation in the more sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fulness and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the word nor sometimes the very cast of the periods neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry
what i would further recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with virgil above all the ancients and with milton above all the moderns
next these the archbishop of cambray telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and bossu admirable treatise of the epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct
but after all with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few
it is a great loss to the poetical world that mr dryden did not live to translate the iliad those only who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning
for to satisfy such a want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that is not greek
what i have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions i am prepared to learn though i fear no judges so little as our best poets who are most sensible of the weight of this task
as for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men but none as they are malignant writers
i was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by person for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit
mr addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as i cannot repeat without vanity
i was obliged to sir richard steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public dr swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend
i must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticism of mr congreve who had led me the way in translating some parts of homer
i must add the names of mr rowe and dr parnell though i shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature to give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning
the humanity and frankness of sir samuel garth are what i never knew wanting on any occasion the favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection
but what can i say of the honour so many of the great have done me while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers
among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet that his grace the duke of buckingham was not displeased i should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent essay so complete a praise read homer once and you can read no more for all books else appear so mean so poor verse will seem prose but still persist to read and homer will be all the books you need
that the earl of halifax was one of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example that such a genius as my lord bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that the noble author of the tragedy of heroic love has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the iliad
i cannot deny myself the pride of confessing that i have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation
i could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the earl of carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them
mr stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair
the particular zeal of mr harcourt the son of the late lord chancellor gave me a proof how much i am honoured in a share of his friendship
i must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence and i am satisfied i can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence
he would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at athens that has been shown me by its learned rival the university of oxford
and i can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death when i reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easy friendships which make the satisfaction of life
this distinction is the more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular men
whatever the success may prove i shall never repent of an undertaking in which i have experienced the candour and friendship of so many person of merit and in which i hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to myself
in short i have found more patrons than ever homer wanted the iliad book i argument the contention of achilles and agamemnon
in the war of troy the greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns and taken from thence two beautiful captives chryseis and briseis allotted the first to agamemnon and the last to achilles
chryses the father of chryseis and priest of apollo comes to the grecian camp to ransom her with which the action of the poem opens in the tenth year of the siege
the priest being refused and insolently dismissed by agamemnon entreats for vengeance from his god who inflicts a pestilence on the greeks
achilles calls a council and encourages chalcas to declare the cause of it who attributes it to the refusal of chryseis
the king being obliged to send back his captive enters into a furious contest with achilles which wise_nestor pacifies however as he had the absolute command of the army he seizes on briseis in revenge
achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the greeks and complaining to thetis she supplicates jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her son by giving victory to the trojans
jupiter granting her suit incenses juno between whom the debate runs high till they are reconciled by the address of vulcan
the time of two and twenty days is taken up in this book nine during the plague one in the council and quarrel of the princes and twelve for jupiter stay with the ćthiopians at whose return thetis prefers her petition
the scene lies in the grecian camp then changes to chrysa and lastly to olympus achilles wrath to greece the direful spring of woes unnumber heavenly goddess sing
that wrath which hurl to pluto gloomy reign the souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain whose limbs unburied on the naked shore devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore
since great achilles and atrides strove such was the sovereign doom and such the will of which_jove declare muse in what ill fated hour
sprung the fierce strife from what offended power latona son a dire contagion spread and heap the camp with mountain of the dead the king of men his reverent priest defied
and for the king offence the people died for chryses sought with costly gifts to gain his captive daughter from the victor chain
suppliant the venerable father stands apollo awful ensigns grace his hands by these he begs and lowly bending down extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
he sued to all but chief implored for grace the brother kings of atreus royal race ye kings and warriors may your vows be
crown and troy proud walls lie level with the ground may which_jove restore you when your toils are er safe to the pleasures of your native shore
but oh relieve a wretched parent pain and give chryseis to these arms again if mercy fail yet let my presents move and dread avenging phoebus son of which_jove
not so atrides he with kingly pride repulsed the sacred sire and thus replied hence on thy life and fly these hostile plains nor ask presumptuous what the king detains
the greeks in shouts their joint assent declare the priest to reverence and release the fair hence with thy laurel crown and golden rod nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god
mine is thy daughter priest and shall remain and prayers and tears and bribes shall plead in vain till time shall rifle every youthful grace and age dismiss her from my cold embrace
in daily labours of the loom employ or doom to deck the bed she once enjoy hence then to argos shall the maid retire
far from her native soil and weeping sire illustration homer invoking the muse homer invoking the muse the trembling priest along the shore return
and in the anguish of a father mourn disconsolate not daring to complain silent he wander by the sounding main till safe at distance to his god he prays the god who darts around the world his rays
smintheus sprung from fair latona line thou guardian power of cilla the divine thou source of light whom tenedos adores and whose bright presence gilds thy chrysa shores
if er with wreaths i hung thy sacred fane or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain god of the silver bow
thy shafts employ avenge thy servant and the greeks destroy thus chryses pray the favouring power attends and from olympus lofty tops descends
bent was his bow the grecian hearts to wound fierce as he moved his silver shafts resound breathing revenge a sudden night he spread and gloomy darkness roll about his head
the fleet in view he twang his deadly bow and hissing fly the feather fate below on mules and dogs the infection first began
and last the vengeful arrows fix in man for nine long nights through all the dusky air the pyres thick flaming shot a dismal glare
but ere the tenth revolving day was run inspired by juno thetis godlike son convened to council all the grecian train for much the goddess mourn her heroes slain
the assembly seated rising er the rest achilles thus the king of men address why leave we not the fatal trojan shore and measure back the sea
we cross before the plague destroying whom the sword would spare tis time to save the few remains of war but let some prophet or some sacred sage
explore the cause of great apollo rage or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove by mystic dreams for dreams descend from which_jove
if broken vows this heavy curse have laid let altars smoke and hecatombs be paid so heaven atoned shall dying greece restore and phoebus dart his burning shafts no more
he said and sat when chalcas thus replied chalcas the wise_nestor the grecian priest and guide that sacred seer whose comprehensive view the past the present and the future knew
uprising slow the venerable sage thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age beloved of which_jove achilles would st thou know why angry phoebus bends his fatal bow
first give thy faith and plight a prince word of sure protection by thy power and sword for i must speak what wisdom would conceal and
truths invidious to the great reveal bold is the task when subjects grown too wise_nestor instruct a monarch where his error lies for though we deem the short lived fury past tis sure the mighty will revenge at last
to whom pelides from thy inmost soul speak what thou know st and speak without control en by that god i swear who rules the day to whom thy hands the vows of greece convey
and whose bless oracles thy lips declare long as achilles breathes this vital air no daring greek of all the numerous band against his priest shall lift an impious hand
encouraged thus the blameless man replies nor vows unpaid nor slighted sacrifice but he our chief provoked the raging pest apollo vengeance for his injured priest
not en the chief by whom our hosts are led the king of kings shall touch that sacred head nor will the god awaken fury cease but plagues shall spread and funeral fires increase
till the great king without a ransom paid to her own chrysa send the black eyed maid perhaps with added sacrifice and prayer the priest may pardon and the god may spare
the prophet spoke when with a gloomy frown the monarch started from his shining throne black choler fill his breast
that boil with ire and from his eye balls flash the living fire augur accursed denouncing mischief still prophet of plagues for ever boding ill
still must that tongue some wounding message bring and still thy priestly pride provoke thy king for this are phoebus oracles explored to teach the greeks to murmur at their lord
for this with falsehood is my honour stain is heaven offended and a priest profaned because my prize my beauteous maid i hold and heavenly charms prefer to proffer gold
a maid unmatch in manners as in face skill in each art and crown with every grace not half so dear were clytaemnestra charms
yet if the gods demand her let her sail our cares are only for the public weal let me be deem the hateful cause of all and suffer rather than my people fall
when first her blooming beauties bless my arms the prize the beauteous prize i will resign so dearly valued and so justly mine
but since for common good i yield the fair my private loss let grateful greece repair nor unrewarded let your prince complain that he alone has fought and bled in vain
insatiate king achilles thus replies fond of the power but fonder of the prize would st thou the greeks their lawful prey should yield the due reward of many a well fought field
the spoil of cities razed and warriors slain we share with justice as with toil we gain but to resume whate er thy avarice craves that trick of tyrants may be borne by slave
yet if our chief for plunder only fight the spoil of ilion shall thy loss requite whene er by which_jove decree our conquering powers shall humble to the dust her lofty towers
then thus the king shall i my prize resign with tame content and thou possess of thine great as thou art and like a god in fight think not to rob me of a soldier right
first let the just equivalent be paid such as a king might ask and let it be a treasure worthy her and worthy me
at thy demand shall i restore the maid or grant me this or with a monarch claim this hand shall seize some other captive dame
the mighty oilean_ajax shall his prize resign ulysses spoil or even thy own be mine the man who suffers loudly may complain and rage he may but he shall rage in vain
but this when time requires it now remains we launch a bark to plough the watery plains and waft the sacrifice to chrysa shores with chosen pilots and with labouring oars
soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend and some deputed prince the charge attend this creta king or oilean_ajax shall fulfil or wise_nestor ulysses see perform our will or if our royal pleasure shall ordain achilles self conduct her er the main let fierce achilles dreadful in his rage the god propitiate and the pest assuage

to avenge a private not a public wrong what else to troy the assembled nations draws but thine ungrateful and thy brother cause

and darest thou threat to snatch my prize away due to the deeds of many a dreadful day a prize as small tyrant
match with thine as thy own actions if compared to mine thine in each conquest is the wealthy prey though mine the sweat and danger of the day

the gods command me to forgive the past but let this first invasion be the last for know thy blood when next thou darest invade shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade
at this they ceased the stern_hector debate expired the chiefs in sullen majesty retired achilles with patroclus took his way where near his tents his hollow vessels lay

this the godlike man perceived and thus with accent mild began patroclus haste the fair briseis bring conduct my captive to the haughty king
but first and loudest to your prince declare that lawless tyrant whose commands you bear unmoved as death achilles shall remain
but witness heralds and proclaim my vow witness to gods above and men below though prostrate greece shall bleed at every vein

in chrysa port now sage ulysses rode beneath the deck the destined victims stow the sails they furl they lash the mast aside and dropp their anchors and the pinnace tied
her thus returning from the furrow main ulysses led to phoebus sacred fane where at his solemn altar as the maid he gave to chryses thus the hero said hail reverend priest
next on the shore their hecatomb they land chryseis last descending on the strand to phoebus awful dome a suppliant
i from great atrides come unransom here receive the spotless fair accept the hecatomb the greeks prepare and may thy god who scatters darts around atoned by sacrifice desist to wound

if fired to vengeance at thy priest request thy direful darts inflict the raging pest once more attend avert the wasteful woe and smile propitious and unbend thy bow
at this the sire embraced the maid again so sadly lost so lately sought in vain so chryses pray apollo heard his prayer
and now the greeks their hecatomb prepare between their horns the salted barley threw and with their heads to heaven the victims slew
the limbs they sever from the inclosing hide the thighs selected to the gods divide on these in double cauls involved with art the choicest morsels lay from every part
pours the black wine and sees the flames aspire the youth with instruments surround the fire the thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dress
the assistants part transfix and roast the rest then spread the tables the repast prepare each takes his seat and each receives his share
the priest himself before his altar stands and burns the offering with his holy hands when now the rage of hunger was
repress with pure libations they conclude the feast the youths with wine the copious goblets crown and pleased dispense the flowing bowls around
with hymns divine the joyous banquet end the paeans lengthen till the sun descends the greeks restored the grateful note prolong apollo listens and approves the song
twas night the chiefs beside their vessel lie till rosy morn had purpled er the sky then launch and hoist the mast indulgent gales supplied by phoebus fill the swelling sails the milk white canvas bellying as they blow the parted ocean foams and roars below above the bounding billows swift they flew till now the grecian camp appear in view
far on the beach they haul their bark to land the crooked keel divides the yellow sand then part where stretch along the winding bay the ships and tents in mingled prospect lay
nor mix in combat nor in council join but wasting cares lay heavy on his mind in his black thought revenge and slaughter roll and scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul
twelve days were past and now the dawning light the gods had summon to the olympian height which_jove first ascending from the watery bowers leads the long order of ethereal powers
but raging still amidst his navy sat the stern_hector achilles stedfast in his hate when like the morning mist in early day rose from the flood the daughter of the sea
there far apart and high above the rest the thunderer sat where old olympus shrouds his hundred heads in heaven and props the clouds
and to the seats divine her flight address suppliant the goddess stood one hand she placed beneath his beard and one his knees embraced
my word could please thee or my actions aid some marks of honour on my son bestow and pay in glory what in life you owe
if er father of the gods she said fame is at least by heavenly promise due to life so short and now dishonour too

to grace her fierce inexorable son perhaps in grecian blood to drench the plain and glut his vengeance with my people slain
then thus the god restless fate of pride that strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide vain is the search presumptuous and
abhorr anxious to thee and odious to thy lord let this suffice the immutable decree no force can shake what is that ought to be
goddess submit nor dare our will withstand but dread the power of this avenging hand the united strength of all the gods above

thou goddess mother with our sire comply nor break the sacred union of the sky lest roused to rage he shake the bless abodes launch the red lightning and dethrone the gods
thus vulcan spoke and rising with a bound the double bowl with sparkling nectar crown which held to juno in a cheerful way goddess he cried be patient and obey
dear as you are if which_jove his arm extend i can but grieve unable to defend what god so daring in your aid to move or lift his hand against the force of which_jove

jupiter in pursuance of the request of thetis sends a deceitful vision to agamemnon persuading him to lead the army to battle in order to make the greeks sensible of their want of achilles
the general who is deluded with the hopes of taking troy without his assistance but fears the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague as well as by the length of time contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem
he first communicates his design to the princes in council that he would propose a return to the soldiers and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced
then he assembles the whole host and upon moving for a return to greece they unanimously agree to it and run to prepare the ships
the assembly is recalled several speeches made on the occasion and at length the advice of wise_nestor followed which was to make a general muster of the troops and to divide them into their several nations before they proceeded to battle
this gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the greeks and trojans and in a large catalogue
they are detained by the management of ulysses who chastises the insolence of thersites the time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day

your own resistless eloquence employ and to the immortals trust the fall of troy the voice divine confess the warlike maid ulysses heard nor uninspired
thus graced attention and respect to gain he runs he flies through all the grecian train each prince of name or chief in arms approved he fired with praise or with persuasion moved
obey then meeting first atrides from his hand received the imperial sceptre of command warriors like you with strength and wisdom bless by brave examples should confirm the rest
the monarch will not yet reveal appears he tries our courage but resents our fears the unwary greeks his fury may provoke not thus the king in secret council spoke
which_jove loves our chief from which_jove his honour springs beware for dreadful is the wrath of kings but if a clamorous vile plebeian rose him with reproof he check or tamed with blows
be still thou slave and to thy betters yield unknown alike in council and in field ye gods what dastards would our host command
swept to the war the lumber of a land be silent wretch and think not here allow that worst of tyrants an usurping crowd
to one sole monarch which_jove commits the sway his are the laws and him let all obey with word like these the troops ulysses ruled the loudest silenced and the fiercest cool
murmuring they move as when old ocean roars and heaves huge surges to the trembling shores the groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound the rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound
back to the assembly roll the thronging train desert the ships and pour upon the plain at length the tumult sinks the noises cease and a still silence lulls the camp to peace
controll in scandal busy in reproaches bold with witty malice studious to defame scorn all his joy and laughter all his aim
thersites only clamour in the throng loquacious loud and turbulent of tongue awed by no shame by no respect but chief he gloried with licentious style to lash the great and monarchs to revile
his figure such as might his soul proclaim one eye was blinking and one leg was lame his mountain shoulders half his breast erspread thin hairs
spleen to mankind his envious heart possess and much he hated all but most the best ulysses or achilles still his theme
bestrew his long misshapen head but royal scandal his delight supreme long had he lived the scorn of every greek vex when he spoke yet still they heard him speak
sharp was his voice which in the shrillest tone thus with injurious taunts attack the throne amidst the glories of so bright a reign what moves the great atrides to complain
tis thine whate er the warrior breast inflames the golden spoil and thine the lovely dames with all the wealth our wars and blood bestow thy tents are crowded and thy chests erflow
thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll what grieves the monarch is it thirst of gold say shall we march with our unconquer powers the greeks and i to ilion hostile towers
and bring the race of royal bastards here for troy to ransom at a price too dear but safer plunder thy own host supplies say wouldst thou seize some valiant leader prize
or if thy heart to generous love be led some captive fair to bless thy kingly bed whate er our master craves submit we must plagued with his pride or punish for his lust
oh women of achaia men no more hence let us fly and let him waste his store in loves and pleasures on the phrygian shore
we may be wanted on some busy day when stern_hector comes so great achilles may from him he forced the prize we jointly gave from him the fierce the fearless and the brave
and durst he as he ought resent that wrong this mighty tyrant were no tyrant long fierce from his seat at this ulysses springs
with indignation sparkling in his eyes he views the wretch and sternly thus replies peace factious monster born to vex the state with wrangling talents form for foul debate curb that impetuous tongue nor rashly vain and singly mad asperse the sovereign reign
in generous vengeance of the king of kings have we not known thee slave of all our host the man who acts the least upbraids the most
think not the greeks to shameful flight to bring nor let those lips profane the name of king for our return we trust the heavenly powers be that their care to fight like men be ours
but grant the host with wealth the general load except detraction what hast thou bestow suppose some hero should his spoil resign art thou that hero could those spoil be thine
if on thy next offence this hand forbear to strip those arms thou ill deserv st to wear expel the council where our princes meet and send thee scourged and howling through the fleet
gods let me perish on this hateful shore and let these eyes behold my son no more he said and cowering as the dastard bends the weighty sceptre on his bank descends
the tears spring starting from his haggard eyes trembling he sat and shrunk in abject fears from his vile visage wiped the scalding tears while to his neighbour each
on the round bunch the bloody tumours rise express his thought ye gods what wonders has ulysses wrought what fruits his conduct and his courage yield
generous he rise in the crown defence to curb the factious tongue of insolence such just examples on offenders shown sedition silence and assert the throne
great in the council glorious in the field twas thus the general voice the hero praised who rising high the imperial sceptre raised
the blue eyed pallas his celestial friend in form a herald bade the crowds attend the expecting crowds in still attention hung to hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue
then deeply thoughtful pausing ere he spoke his silence thus the prudent hero broke unhappy monarch whom the grecian race with shame deserting heap with vile disgrace
once all their voice but ah forgotten now ne er to return was then the common cry till troy proud structures should in ashes lie
not such at argos was their generous vow behold them weeping for their native shore what could their wife or helpless children more
few leagues removed we wish our peaceful seat when the ship tosses and the tempests beat then well may this long stay provoke their tears the tedious length of nine revolving years
what heart but melts to leave the tender train and one short month endure the wintry main not for their grief the grecian host i blame but vanquish
baffled oh eternal shame expect the time to troy destruction given and try the faith of chalcas and of heaven what pass at aulis greece can witness bear
beside a fountain sacred brink we raised our verdant altars and the victims blazed twas where the plane tree spread its shades around the altars heaved and from the crumbling ground
and all who live to breathe this phrygian air a mighty dragon shot of dire portent from which_jove himself the dreadful sign was sent
the topmost branch a mother bird possess eight callow infant fill the mossy nest herself the ninth the serpent as he hung stretch his black jaws and crush the crying young while hovering near with miserable moan
straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll and curl around in many a winding fold the drooping mother wail d
the mother last as round the nest she flew seized by the beating wing the monster slew nor long survived to marble turn he stands a lasting prodigy on aulis sands
her children gone such was the will of which_jove and hence we dare trust in his omen and support the war
for while around we gazed with wondering eyes and trembling sought the powers with sacrifice full of his god the reverend chalcas cried
as many birds as by the snake were slain so many years the toils of greece remain but wait the tenth for ilion fall decreed thus spoke the prophet thus the fate succeed
ye grecian warriors lay your fears aside this wondrous signal which_jove himself displays of long long labours but eternal praise obey ye grecians
with submission wait nor let your flight avert the trojan fate he said the shores with loud applauses sound the hollow ships each deafening shout rebound
then wise_nestor thus these vain debates forbear ye talk like children not like heroes dare where now are all your high resolves at last
your leagues concluded your engagements past vow with libations and with victims then now vanish like their smoke the faith of men
while useless word consume the unactive hours no wonder troy so long resists our powers rise great atrides and with courage sway we march to war if thou direct the way
but leave the few that dare resist thy laws the mean deserters of the grecian cause to grudge the conquests mighty which_jove prepares and view with envy our successful wars
on that great day when first the martial train big with the fate of ilion plough the main which_jove on the right a prosperous signal sent and thunder rolling shook the firmament
encouraged hence maintain the glorious strife till every soldier grasp a phrygian wife till argive_helen woes at full revenged appear and troy proud matrons render tear for tear
before that day if any greek invite his country troops to base inglorious flight stand forth that greek and hoist his sail to fly and die the dastard first who dreads to die
among those counsels let not mine be vain in tribes and nations to divide thy train his separate troops let every leader call each strengthen each and all encourage all
what chief or soldier of the numerous band or bravely fights or ill obeys command when thus distinct they war shall soon be known
but now monarch all thy chiefs advise nor what they offer thou thyself despise and what the cause of ilion not erthrown
if fate resists or if our arms are slow if gods above prevent or men below to him the king how much thy years excel in arts of counsel and in speaking well
but ten such sages as they grant in thee such wisdom soon should priam force destroy and soon should fall the haughty towers of troy
but which_jove forbids who plunges those he hates in fierce contention and in vain debates now great achilles from our aid withdraws by me provoked a captive maid the cause
o would the gods in love to greece decree if er as friends we join the trojan wall must shake and heavy will the vengeance fall
his sharpen spear let every grecian wield and every grecian fix his brazen shield let all excite the fiery steeds of war and all for combat fit the rattling car
this day this dreadful day let each contend no rest no respite till the shades descend till darkness or till death shall cover all let the war bleed and let the mighty fall till bathed in sweat be every manly breast with the huge shield each brawny arm depress each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw and each spent courser at the chariot blow
who dares inglorious in his ships to stay who dares to tremble on this signal day that wretch too mean to fall by martial power the birds shall mangle and the dogs devour
but now ye warriors take a short repast and well refresh to bloody conflict haste the monarch spoke and straight a murmur rose loud as the surges when the tempest blows
the troops dispersing bend the fires are kindled and the smokes ascend with hasty feasts they sacrifice and pray to avert the dangers of the doubtful day
that dash on broken rocks tumultuous roar and foam and thunder on the stony shore straight to the tents a steer of five years age large limb and fed
to which_jove high altars agamemnon led there bade the noblest of the grecian peers and wise_nestor first as most advanced in years
next came idomeneus and tydeus son oilean_ajax the less and oilean_ajax ajax_telamon then wise_nestor ulysses in his rank was placed and great_menelaus came unbid the last
the chiefs surround the destined beast and take the sacred offering of the salted cake when thus the king prefers his solemn prayer
thou whose thunder rends the clouded air who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne supreme of gods
and before the burning sun descends before the night her gloomy veil extends low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires
unbounded and alone hear be priam palace sunk in grecian fires in stern_hector breast be plunged this shining sword and slaughter heroes groan around their lord
thus prayed the chief his unavailing prayer great which_jove refused and toss in empty air the god averse while yet the fumes arose prepared new toils and doubled woes on woes
their prayers perform the chiefs the rite pursue the barley sprinkled and the victim slew the limbs they sever from the inclosing hide the thighs selected to the gods divide
on these in double cauls involved with art the choicest morsels lie from every part from the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire while the fat victims feed the sacred fire
the thighs thus sacrificed and entrails dress the assistants part transfix and roast the rest then spread the tables the repast prepare each takes his seat and each receives his share
now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms and call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms now seize the occasion now the troops survey and lead to war when heaven directs the way
he said the monarch issued his commands straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands the chiefs inclose their king the hosts divide
soon as the rage of hunger was suppress the generous wise_nestor thus the prince address in tribes and nations rank on either side
the dreadful aegis which_jove immortal shield blazed on her arm and lighten all the field round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll form the bright fringe and seem to burn in gold with this each grecian manly breast she warms swells their bold hearts and strings their nervous arms
high in the midst the blue eyed virgin flies from rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes no more they sigh inglorious to return
as on some mountain through the lofty grove the crackling flames ascend and blaze above the fires expanding as the winds arise shoot their long beams and kindle half the skies so from the polish arms and brazen shields a gleamy splendour flash along the fields
but breathe revenge and for the combat burn not less their number than the embodied cranes or milk white swans in asius watery plains

great as the gods the exalted chief was seen his strength like neptune and like mars his mien which_jove er his eyes celestial glories spread and dawning conquest played around his head

thus from his flaggy wings when notus sheds a night of vapours round the mountain heads swift gliding mists the dusky fields invade to thieves more grateful than the midnight shade
while scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey lost and confused amidst the thicken day so wrapp in gathering dust the grecian train a moving cloud swept on and hid the plain
now front to front the hostile armies stand eager of fight and only wait command when to the van before the son of fame whom troy sent forth the beauteous paris came
his bended bow across his shoulders flung his sword beside him negligently hung two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace and dared the bravest of the grecian race
as thus with glorious air and proud disdain he boldly stalk the foremost on the plain him great_menelaus loved of mars espies with heart elated and with joyful eyes
so joys a lion if the branching deer or mountain goat his bulky prize appear eager he seizes and devours the slain press by bold youths and baying dogs in vain
thus fond of vengeance with a furious bound in clanging arms he leaps upon the ground from his high chariot him approaching near
the beauteous champion views with marks of fear smit with a conscious sense retires behind and shuns the fate he well deserved to find
as when some shepherd from the rustling trees shot forth to view a scaly serpent sees trembling and pale he starts with wild affright
in form a god the panther speckled hide flow o er his armour with an easy pride and all confused precipitates his flight
so from the king the shining warrior flies and plunged amid the thickest trojans lies as godlike stern_hector sees the prince retreat he thus upbraids him with a generous heat unhappy paris
but to women brave so fairly form and only to deceive oh hadst thou died when first thou saw st the light or died at least before thy nuptial rite
a better fate than vainly thus to boast and fly the scandal of thy trojan host gods how the scornful greeks exult to see their fears of danger undeceived in thee
in former days in all thy gallant pride when thy tall ships triumphant stemm the tide when greece beheld thy painted canvas flow and crowds stood wondering at the passing show say was it thus with such a baffled mien you met the approaches of the spartan queen thus from her realm
thy figure promised with a martial air but ill thy soul supplies a form so fair convey the beauteous prize and both her warlike lords outshined in argive_helen eyes
this deed thy foes delight thy own disgrace thy father grief and ruin of thy race this deed recalls thee to the proffer fight or hast thou injured
whom thou dar st not right soon to thy cost the field would make thee know thou keep st the consort of a braver foe
thy graceful form instilling soft desire thy curling tresses and thy silver lyre beauty and youth in vain to these you trust when youth and beauty shall be laid in dust troy yet may wake and one avenging blow crush the dire author of his country woe
tis just my brother what your anger speaks but who like thee can boast a soul sedate so firmly proof to all the shocks of fate
thy force like steel a temper hardness shows still edged to wound and still untired with blows like steel uplifted by some strenuous swain with falling woods to strew the wasted plain
thy gifts i praise nor thou despise the charms with which a lover golden venus arms soft moving speech and pleasing outward show no wish can gain them but the gods bestow
yet would st thou have the proffer combat stand the greeks and trojans seat on either hand then let a midway space our hosts divide
and on that stage of war the cause be tried by paris there the spartan king be fought for beauteous argive_helen and the wealth she brought and who his rival can in arms subdue his be the fair and his the treasure too
his silence here with blushes paris breaks thus with a lasting league your toils may cease and troy possess her fertile fields in peace
the challenge stern_hector heard with joy then with his spear restrain the youth of troy held by the midst athwart and near the foe advanced with steps majestically slow while round his dauntless head the grecians pour their stones and arrows in a mingled shower
thus may the greeks review their native shore much famed for generous steeds for beauty more he said then thus the monarch great atrides cried forbear ye warriors lay the darts aside
a parley stern_hector asks a message bears we know him by the various plume he wears awed by his high command the greeks attend the tumult silence and the fight suspend
while from the centre stern_hector rolls his eyes on either host and thus to both applies hear all ye trojan all ye grecian bands what paris author of the war demand
here in the midst in either army sight he dares the spartan king to single fight and wills that argive_helen and the ravish spoil that caused the contest shall reward the toil
your shining swords within the sheath restrain and pitch your lances in the yielding plain let these the brave triumphant victor grace and different nations part in leagues of peace
he spoke in still suspense on either side each army stood the spartan chief replied me too ye warriors hear whose fatal right
a world engages in the toils of fight to me the labour of the field resign me paris injured all the war be mine
fall he that must beneath his rival arms and live the rest secure of future harms two lambs devoted by your country rite
to earth a sable to the sun a white prepare ye trojans while a third we bring select to which_jove the inviolable king
let reverend priam in the truce engage and add the sanction of considerate age his son are faithless headlong in debate and youth itself an empty wavering state cool age advances venerably wise_nestor
turns on all hands its deep discerning eyes sees what befell and what may yet befall concludes from both and best provides for all
the nations hear with rising hopes possess and peaceful prospects dawn in every breast within the lines they drew their steeds around
and from their chariots issued on the ground next all unbuckling the rich mail they wore laid their bright arms along the sable shore
on either side the meeting hosts are seen with lances fix and close the space between two heralds now despatch to troy invite the phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite
meantime to beauteous argive_helen from the skies the various goddess of the rainbow flies like fair laodice in form and face the loveliest nymph of priam royal race her in the palace at her loom she found the golden web her own sad story crown the trojan wars she weaved herself the prize and the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes
talthybius hastens to the fleet to bring the lamb for which_jove the inviolable king to whom the goddess of the painted bow approach and view the wondrous scene below
each hardy greek and valiant trojan knight so dreadful late and furious for the fight now rest their spears or lean upon their shields ceased is the war and silent all the fields
paris alone and sparta king advance in single fight to toss the beamy lance each met in arms the fate of combat tries thy love the motive and thy charms the prize
this said the many coloured maid inspires her husband love and wakes her former fires her country parents all that once were dear rush to her thought and force a tender tear er her fair face a snowy veil she threw
and softly sighing from the loom withdrew her handmaids clymene and ćthra wait her silent footsteps to the scaean gate
the king the first thymoetes at his side lampus and clytius long in council tried panthus and hicetaon once the strong and next the wisest of the reverend throng antenor grave and sage ucalegon lean on the walls and bask before the sun
chiefs who no more in bloody fights engage but wise_nestor through time and narrative with age in summer days like grasshoppers rejoice a bloodless race that send a feeble voice
there sat the seniors of the trojan race old priam chiefs and most in priam grace these when the spartan queen approach the tower
in secret own resistless beauty power they cried no wonder such celestial charms for nine long years have set the world in arms what winning graces
what majestic mien she moves a goddess and she looks a queen yet hence heaven convey that fatal face and from destruction save the trojan race
the good old priam welcomed her and cried approach my child and grace thy father side see on the plain thy grecian spouse appears the friends and kindred of thy former years
no crime of thine our present sufferings draws not thou but heaven disposing will the cause the gods these armies and this force employ the hostile gods conspire the fate of troy
but lift thy eyes and say what greek is he far as from hence these aged orbs can see around whose brow such martial graces shine so tall so awful and almost divine
though some of larger stature tread the green none match his grandeur and exalted mien he seems a monarch and his country pride
thus ceased the king and thus the fair replied before thy presence father i appear with conscious shame and reverential fear
ah had i died ere to these walk i fled false to my country and my nuptial bed my brothers friends and daughter left behind false to them all to paris only kind
for this i mourn till grief or dire disease shall waste the form whose fault it was to please the king of kings atrides you survey great in the war and great in arts of sway
my brother once before my days of shame and oh that still he bore a brother name with wonder priam view the godlike man extoll the happy prince and thus began
bless atrides born to prosperous fate successful monarch of a mighty state how vast thy empire of your matchless train what numbers lost what numbers yet remain
in ancient time when otreus fill the throne when godlike mygdon led their troops of horse and i to join them raised the trojan force against the manlike amazons we stood
in phrygia once were gallant armies known and sangar stream ran purple with their blood but far inferior those in martial grace and strength of numbers to this grecian race
this said once more he view the warrior train what he whose arms lie scatter on the plain broad is his breast his shoulders larger spread though great atrides overtops his head
nor yet appear his care and conduct small from rank to rank he moves and orders all the stately ram thus measures er the ground and master of the flock surveys them round
then argive_helen thus whom your discerning eyes have singled out is ithacus the wise_nestor a barren island boasts his glorious birth his fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth
when trusting which_jove and hospitable laws to troy he came to plead the grecian cause great_menelaus urged the same request
my house was honour with each royal guest i knew their person and admired their parts both brave in arms and both approved in arts
antenor took the word and thus began myself king have seen that wondrous man erect the spartan most engaged our view ulysses seated greater reverence drew
when atreus son harangued the listening train just was his sense and his expression plain his word succinct yet full without a fault he spoke no more than just the thing he ought
his modest eyes he fix upon the ground as one unskill or dumb he seem to stand nor raised his head nor stretch his sceptred hand
but when ulysses rose in thought profound but when he speaks what elocution flows soft as the fleeces of descending snows
the copious accents fall with easy art melting they fall and sink into the heart wondering we hear and fix in deep surprise our ears refute the censure of our eyes
what chief is that with giant strength endued whose brawny shoulders and whose swelling chest and lofty stature far exceed the rest
the king then ask as yet the camp he view oilean_ajax the great the beauteous queen replied himself a host the grecian strength and pride
see bold idomeneus superior towers amid yon circle of his cretan powers great as a god i saw him once before with great_menelaus on the spartan shore
yet two are wanting of the numerous train whom long my eyes have sought but sought in vain castor and pollux first in martial force one bold on foot and one renown for horse
the rest i know and could in order name all valiant chiefs and men of mighty fame my brothers these the same our native shore one house contain us as one mother bore
perhaps the chiefs from warlike toils at ease for distant troy refused to sail the sea perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws
so spoke the fair nor knew her brothers doom wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb adorn with honours in their native shore silent they slept and heard of wars no more
ashamed to combat in their sister cause meantime the heralds through the crowded town bring the rich wine and destined victims down
idaeus arms the golden goblets press who thus the venerable king address arise father of the trojan state the nations call thy joyful people wait to seal the truce and end the dire debate
paris thy son and sparta king advance in measured lists to toss the weighty lance and who his rival shall in arms subdue his be the dame and his the treasure too
thus with a lasting league our toils may cease and troy possess her fertile fields in peace so shall the greeks review their native shore
with grief he heard and bade the chiefs prepare to join his milk white coursers to the car he mounts the seat antenor at his side the gentle steeds through scaea gates they guide
much famed for generous steeds for beauty more next from the car descending on the plain amid the grecian host and trojan train slow they proceed
on either side a sacred herald stands the wine they mix and on each monarch hands pour the full urn then draws the grecian lord his cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword from the sign victims crops the curling hair
the heralds part it and the princes share then loudly thus before the attentive bands he calls the gods and spreads his lifted hands first and greatest power whom all obey who high on ida holy mountain sway eternal which_jove
the sage ulysses then arose and with him rose the king of men and you bright orb that roll from east to west and view from pole to pole
thou mother earth and all ye living floods infernal furies and tartarean gods who rule the dead and horrid woes prepare for perjured kings and all who falsely swear
if by paris slain great_menelaus press the fatal plain the dame and treasures let the trojan keep and greece returning plough the watery deep
hear and be witness if by my brother lance the trojan bleed be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed the appointed fine let ilion justly pay
and every age record the signal day this if the phrygians shall refuse to yield arms must revenge and mars decide the field
with that the chief the tender victims slew and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw the vital spirit issued at the wound and left the members quivering on the ground
from the same urn they drink the mingled wine and add libations to the powers divine while thus their prayers united mount the sky hear mighty which_jove
and may their blood who first the league confound shed like this wine disdain the thirsty ground may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust and all their lust be scatter as the dust
and hear ye gods on high thus either host their imprecations join which_jove refused and mingled with the wind the rites now finish reverend priam rose and thus express a heart ercharged with woes
ye greeks and trojans let the chiefs engage but spare the weakness of my feeble age in yonder walls that object let me shun nor view the danger of so dear a son
whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall heaven only knows for heaven disposes all this said the hoary king no longer stay
but on his car the slaughter victims laid then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide and drove to troy antenor at his side
bold stern_hector and ulysses now dispose the lists of combat and the ground inclose next to decide by sacred lots prepare who first shall launch his pointed spear in air
the people pray with elevated hands and word like these are heard through all the bands immortal which_jove high heaven superior lord on lofty ida holy mount adored
whoe er involved us in this dire debate give that author of the war to fate and shades eternal let division cease and joyful nations join in leagues of peace
with eyes averted stern_hector hastes to turn the lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn then paris thine leap forth by fatal chance ordain the first to whirl the weighty lance
both armies sat the combat to survey beside each chief his azure armour lay and round the lists the generous coursers neigh
with flowers adorn with silver buckles bound lycaon corslet his fair body dress braced in and fitted to his softer breast a radiant baldric er his shoulder tied sustain the sword that glitter at his side his youthful face a polish helm erspread the waving horse hair nodded on his head
the beauteous warrior now arrays for fight in gilded arms magnificently bright the purple cuishes clasp his thighs around his figured shield a shining orb he takes
and in his hand a pointed javelin shakes with equal speed and fired by equal charms the spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms
now round the lists the admiring armies stand with javelins fix the greek and trojan band amidst the dreadful vale the chiefs advance all pale with rage and shake the threatening lance
full on atrides ringing shield it flew nor pierced the brazen orb but with a bound leap from the buckler blunted on the ground
the trojan first his shining javelin threw atrides then his massy lance prepares in act to throw but first prefers his prayers give me great which_jove
to punish lawless lust and lay the trojan gasping in the dust destroy the aggressor aid my righteous cause avenge the breach of hospitable laws
be said and poised in air the javelin sent through paris shield the forceful weapon went his corslet pierces and his garment rends and glancing downward near his flank descends
let this example future times reclaim and guard from wrong fair friendship holy name the wary trojan bending from the blow eludes the death and disappoints his foe
but fierce atrides waved his sword and strook full on his casque the crested helmet shook the brittle steel unfaithful to his hand broke short the fragments glitter on the sand
the raging warrior to the spacious skies raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes then is it vain in which_jove himself to trust
and is it thus the gods assist the just when crimes provoke us heaven success denies the dart falls harmless and the falchion flies
furious he said and towards the grecian crew seized by the crest the unhappy warrior drew struggling he followed while the embroider thong that tied his helmet dragg the chief along
then had his ruin crown atrides joy but venus trembled for the prince of troy unseen she came and burst the golden band and left an empty helmet in his hand
the casque enraged amidst the greeks he threw the greeks with smiles the polish trophy view then as once more he lifts the deadly dart
in thirst of vengeance at his rival heart the queen of love her favour champion shrouds for gods can all things in a veil of clouds
raised from the field the panting youth she led and gently laid him on the bridal bed with pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews
meantime the brightest of the female kind the matchless argive_helen er the walls reclined to her beset with trojan beauties came
and all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews in borrow form the laughter loving dame she seem an ancient maid well skill to cull the snowy fleece and wind the twisted wool
the goddess softly shook her silken vest that shed perfumes and whispering thus address illustration venus disguised inviting argive_helen to the chamber of paris
safe from the fight in yonder lofty walls fair as a god with odours round him spread he lies and waits thee on the well known bed not like a warrior parted from the foe but some gay dancer in the public show
venus disguised inviting argive_helen to the chamber of paris haste happy nymph for thee thy paris calls she spoke and argive_helen secret soul was moved she scorn the champion but the man she loved
fair venus neck her eyes that sparkled fire and breast reveal the queen of soft desire struck with her presence straight the lively red forsook her cheek and trembling thus she said then is it still thy pleasure to deceive
and woman frailty always to believe say to new nations must i cross the main or carry wars to some soft asian plain
for whom must argive_helen break her second vow what other paris is thy darling now left to atrides victor in the strife
an odious conquest and a captive wife hence let me sail and if thy paris bear my absence ill let venus ease his care
a handmaid goddess at his side to wait renounce the glories of thy heavenly state be fix for ever to the trojan shore his spouse or slave and mount the skies no more
for me to lawless love no longer led i scorn the coward and detest his bed else should i merit everlasting shame and keen reproach from every phrygian dame
ill suits it now the joys of love to know too deep my anguish and too wild my woe illustration venus presenting argive_helen to paris
obey the power from whom thy glories rise should venus leave thee every charm must fly fade from thy cheek and languish in thy eye
cease to provoke me lest i make thee more the world aversion than their love before now the bright prize for which mankind engage than the sad victim of the public rage
at this the fairest of her sex obey and veil her blushes in a silken shade unseen and silent from the train she moves led by the goddess of the smiles and loves
venus presenting argive_helen to paris then thus incensed the paphian queen replies arrived and enter at the palace gate the maids officious round their mistress wait
then all dispersing various tasks attend the queen and goddess to the prince ascend full in her paris sight the queen of love had placed the beauteous progeny of which_jove where as he view d
her charms she turn away her glowing eyes and thus began to say is this the chief who lost to sense of shame late fled the field and yet survives his fame
o hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword of that brave man whom once i call my lord the boaster paris oft desired the day
with sparta king to meet in single fray go now once more thy rival rage excite provoke atrides and renew the fight
the prince replies ah cease divinely fair nor add reproaches to the wounds i bear this day the foe prevail by pallas power we yet may vanquish in a happier hour there want not gods to favour us above but let the business of our life be love these softer moments let delights employ and kind embraces snatch the hasty joy
yet argive_helen bids thee stay lest thou unskill shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field not thus i loved thee when from sparta shore
my forced my willing heavenly prize i bore when first entranced in cranae isle i lay mix with thy soul and all dissolved away
thus having spoke the enamour phrygian boy rush to the bed impatient for the joy him argive_helen follow slow with bashful charms
while these to love delicious rapture yield the stern_hector atrides rages round the field so some fell lion whom the woods obey roars through the desert and demand his prey
and clasp the blooming hero in her arms paris he seeks impatient to destroy but seeks in vain along the troops of troy
even those had yielded to a foe so brave the recreant warrior hateful as the grave then speaking thus the king of kings arose ye trojans dardans all our generous foes
hear and attest from heaven with conquest crown our brother arms the just success have found be therefore now the spartan wealth restor d
let argive_helen own her lawful lord the appointed fine let ilion justly pay and age to age record this signal day
he ceased his army loud applauses rise and the long shout runs echoing through the skies illustration venus venus illustration map titled graeciae antiquae
the gods deliberate in council concerning the trojan war they agree upon the continuation of it and jupiter sends down minerva to break the truce
map titled graeciae antiquae book iv argument the breach of the truce and the first battle she persuades pandarus to aim an arrow at great_menelaus who is wounded but cured by machaon
agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general he reviews the troops and exhorts the leaders some by praises and others by reproof
in the meantime some of the trojan troops attack the greeks wise_nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline the battle joins and great numbers are slain on both sides
the same day continues through this as through the last book as it does also through the two following and almost to the end of the seventh book
and now olympus shining gates unfold the gods with which_jove assume their thrones of gold immortal hebe fresh with bloom divine the golden goblet crowns with purple wine while the full bowls flow round the powers employ their careful eyes on long contended troy
when which_jove disposed to tempt saturnia spleen thus waked the fury of his partial queen two powers divine the son of atreus aid imperial juno and the martial maid
the scene is wholly in the field before troy but high in heaven they sit and gaze from far the tame spectators of his deeds of war
not thus fair venus helps her favour knight the queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight each danger wards and constant in her care saves in the moment of the last despair
her act has rescued paris forfeit life though great atrides gain the glorious strife then say ye powers what signal issue waits
to crown this deed and finish all the fate shall heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare or rouse the furies and awake the war
yet would the gods for human good provide atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride still priam walls in peaceful honours grow and through his gates the crowding nations flow
thus while he spoke the queen of heaven enraged and queen of war in close consult engaged apart they sit their deep design employ and meditate the future woes of troy
minerva breast the prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress but juno impotent of passion broke her sullen silence and with fury spoke
though secret anger swell illustration the council of the gods the council of the gods shall then tyrant of the ethereal reign
my schemes my labours and my hopes be vain have i for this shook ilion with alarms assembled nations set two worlds in arms
to spread the war i flew from shore to shore the immortal coursers scarce the labour bore at length ripe vengeance er their heads impends but which_jove himself the faithless race defends
loth as thou art to punish lawless lust not all the gods are partial and unjust the sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies sighs from his inmost soul and thus replies
oh lasting rancour oh insatiate hate to phrygia monarch and the phrygian state what high offence has fired the wife of which_jove
can wretched mortals harm the powers above that troy and troy whole race thou wouldst confound and yon fair structures level with the ground
haste leave the skies fulfil thy stern_hector desire burst all her gates and wrap her walls in fire let priam bleed
if yet you thirst for more bleed all his son and ilion float with gore to boundless vengeance the wide realm be given
till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven so let it be and which_jove his peace enjoy when heaven no longer hears the name of troy
on thy loved realms whose guilt demand their fate presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay remember troy and give the vengeance way
for know of all the numerous towns that rise beneath the rolling sun and starry skies which gods have raised or earth born men enjoy none stands so dear to which_jove as sacred troy
but should this arm prepare to wreak our hate no mortals merit more distinguish grace than godlike priam or than priam race
at this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes then on the thunderer fix them and replies three towns are juno on the grecian plains more dear than all the extended earth contains mycenae argos and the spartan wall
still to our name their hecatombs expire and altars blaze with unextinguish fire these thou mayst raze nor i forbid their fall tis not in me the vengeance to remove
the crime sufficient that they share my love of power superior why should i complain resent i may but must resent in vain
yet some distinction juno might require sprung with thyself from one celestial sire a goddess born to share the realms above and styled the consort of the thundering which_jove nor thou a wife and sister s
let both consent and both by terms comply so shall the gods our joint decrees obey and heaven shall act as we direct the way
see ready pallas waits thy high commands to raise in arms the greek and phrygian bands their sudden friendship by her arts may cease
the advice approved and bade minerva fly dissolve the league and all her arts employ to make the breach the faithless act of troy
right deny and the proud trojans first infringe the peace the sire of men and monarch of the sky fired with the charge she headlong urged her flight and shot like lightning from olympus height
as the red comet from saturnius sent to fright the nations with a dire portent a fatal sign to armies on the plain or trembling sailors on the wintry main with sweeping glories glides along in air and shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair
between both armies thus in open sight shot the bright goddess in a trail of light with eyes erect the gazing hosts admire the power descending and the heavens on fire
the gods they cried the gods this signal sent and fate now labours with some vast event which_jove seals the league or bloodier scenes prepares
which_jove the great arbiter of peace and wars they said while pallas through the trojan throng in shape a mortal pass disguised along
like bold laodocus her course she bent who from antenor traced his high descent amidst the ranks lycaon son she found
the warlike pandarus for strength renown whose squadrons led from black ćsepus flood with flaming shields in martial circle stood to him the goddess phrygian
canst thou hear a well timed counsel with a willing ear what praise were thine couldst thou direct thy dart amidst his triumph to the spartan heart
what gifts from troy from paris wouldst thou gain thy country foe the grecian glory slain then seize the occasion dare the mighty deed aim at his breast and may that aim succeed
but first to speed the shaft address thy vow to lycian phoebus with the silver bow and swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay on zelia altars to the god of day
he heard and madly at the motion pleased his polish bow with hasty rashness seized twas form of horn and smooth with artful toil
who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled the stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead and sixteen palms his brow large honours spread the workmen join and shaped the bended horns and beaten gold each taper point adorns
this by the greeks unseen the warrior bends screen by the shields of his surrounding friends there meditates the mark and couching low fits the sharp arrow to the well strung bow
one from a hundred feather deaths he chose fated to wound and cause of future woes then offers vows with hecatombs to crown apollo altars in his native town
now with full force the yielding horn he bends drawn to an arch and joins the doubling end close to his breast he strains the nerve below
till the barb points approach the circling bow the impatient weapon whizzes on the wing sounds the tough horn and twangs the quivering string
a mountain goat resign the shining spoil but thee atrides in that dangerous hour the gods forget not nor thy guardian power pallas assists and weakened in its force
diverts the weapon from its destined course so from her babe when slumber seals his eye the watchful mother wafts the envenom fly
the shaft which hissing from above pass the broad belt and through the corslet drove the folds it pierced the plaited linen tore
just where his belt with golden buckles join where linen folds the double corslet lined she turn and razed the skin and drew the purple gore
as when some stately trappings are decreed to grace a monarch on his bounding steed a nymph in caria or maeonia bred stains the pure ivory with a lively red with equal lustre various colours vie the shining whiteness and the tyrian dye so great atrides
with horror seized the king of men descried the shaft infix and saw the gushing tide nor less the spartan fear before he found the shining barb appear above the wound then with a sigh that heaved his manly breast
the royal brother thus his grief express and grasp his hand while all the greeks around with answering sighs return the plaintive sound
show thy sacred blood as down thy snowy thigh distill the streaming flood oh dear as life did i for this agree the solemn truce a fatal truce to thee
wert thou exposed to all the hostile train to fight for greece and conquer to be slain the race of trojans in thy ruin join and faith is scorn by all the perjured line
those hands we plighted and those oaths we swore shall all be vain when heaven revenge is slow which_jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow
the day shall come that great avenging day when troy proud glories in the dust shall lay when priam powers and priam self shall fall and one prodigious ruin swallow all
not thus our vows confirm with wine and gore i see the god already from the pole bare his red arm and bid the thunder roll
i see the eternal all his fury shed and shake his aegis er their guilty head such mighty woes on perjured princes wait
but thou alas deserv st a happier fate still must i mourn the period of thy days and only mourn without my share of praise
deprived of thee the heartless greeks no more shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore troy seized of argive_helen and our glory lost thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast while some proud trojan thus insulting cries and spurns the dust where great_menelaus lies
such are the trophies greece from ilion brings and such the conquest of her king of kings lo his proud vessels
scatter o er the main and unrevenged his mighty brother slain oh ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame erwhelm me earth and hide a monarch shame
he said a leader and a brother fears possess his soul which thus the spartan cheers let not thy word the warmth of greece abate the feeble dart is guiltless of my fate stiff with the rich embroider work around my varied belt repell the flying wound
to whom the king my brother and my friend thus always thus may heaven thy life defend now seek some skilful hand whose powerful art may stanch the effusion and extract the dart
herald be swift and bid machaon bring his speedy succour to the spartan king pierced with a winged shaft the deed of troy the grecian sorrow and the dardan joy
with hasty zeal the swift talthybius flies through the thick files he darts his searching eyes and finds machaon where sublime he stands
then thus machaon to the king repair his wounded brother claims thy timely care pierced by some lycian or dardanian bow a grief to us a triumph to the foe
in arms incircled with his native bands the heavy tidings grieved the godlike man swift to his succour through the ranks he ran
the dauntless king yet standing firm he found and all the chiefs in deep concern around where to the steely point the reed was join
straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced he loosed the corslet from his breast unbraced then suck the blood and sovereign balm infused
while round the prince the greeks employ their care the trojans rush tumultuous to the war once more they glitter in refulgent arms once more the fields are fill with dire alarms
the shaft he drew but left the head behind which chiron gave and ćsculapius used nor had you seen the king of men appear confused unactive or surprised with fear
no longer with his warlike steeds he stay or press the car with polish brass inlaid but left eurymedon the reins to guide the fiery coursers snorted at his side
but fond of glory with severe delight his beating bosom claim the rising fight on foot through all the martial ranks he moves
he cries to such who boldly dare urge their swift steeds to face the coming war your ancient valour on the foes approve which_jove is with greece and let us trust in which_jove
whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head her son and matrons greece shall lead in chains and her dead warriors strew the mournful plains
and these encourages and those reproves brave men tis not for us but guilty troy to dread thus with new ardour he the brave inspires or thus the fearful with reproaches fires
shame to your country scandal of your kind born to the fate ye well deserve to find why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain prepared for flight but doom to fly in vain
confused and panting thus the hunted deer falls as he flies a victim to his fear still must ye wait the foes and still retire till yon tall vessels blaze with trojan fire
this said he stalk with ample strides along to crete brave monarch and his martial throng high at their head he saw the chief appear and bold meriones excite the rear
or trust ye which_jove a valiant foe shall chase to save a trembling heartless dastard race at this the king his generous joy
express and clasp the warrior to his armed breast divine idomeneus what thanks we owe to worth like thine what praise shall we bestow
for this in banquets when the generous bowls restore our blood and raise the warriors souls though all the rest with stated rules we bound unmix unmeasured are thy goblets crown
to thee the foremost honours are decreed first in the fight and every graceful deed be still thyself in arms a mighty name maintain thy honours and enlarge thy fame
to whom the cretan thus his speech address secure of me king exhort the rest fix to thy side in every toil i share thy firm associate in the day of war

charm with this heat the king his course pursues and next the troops of either oilean_ajax views in one firm orb the bands were ranged around
a cloud of heroes blacken all the ground thus from the lofty promontory brow a swain surveys the gathering storm below
slow from the main the heavy vapours rise spread in dim streams and sail along the skies till black as night the swelling tempest shows the cloud condensing as the west wind blows
he dreads the impending storm and drives his flock to the close covert of an arching rock such and so thick the embattled squadrons stood
with spears erect a moving iron wood a shady light was shot from glimmering shields and their brown arms obscured the dusky fields
whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain exclaim the king who raise your eager bands with great examples more than loud commands
would the gods but breathe in all the rest such souls as burn in your exalted breast soon should our arms with just success be
heroes worthy such a dauntless train ah crown and troy proud walls lie smoking on the ground then to the next the general bends his course his heart exults and glories in his force
there reverend wise_nestor ranks his pylian bands and with inspiring eloquence commands with strictest order sets his train in arms the chiefs advises and the soldiers warms

our great forefathers held this prudent course thus ruled their ardour thus preserved their force by laws like these immortal conquests made and earth proud tyrants low in ashes laid
so spoke the master of the martial art and touch with transport great atrides heart oh hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires and nerves to second what thy soul inspires

the king who saw their squadrons yet unmoved with hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved can peleus son forget a warrior part
he said to watch the motion dubious of the event and fears ulysses skill in every art why stand you distant and the rest expect to mix in combat which yourselves neglect
from you twas hoped among the first to dare the shock of armies and commence the war for this your names are call before the rest to share the pleasures of the genial feast
and can you chiefs without a blush survey whole troops before you labouring in the fray say is it thus those honours you requite
the first in banquets but the last in fight ulysses heard the hero warmth erspread his cheek with blushes and severe he said take back the unjust reproach
behold we stand sheathed in bright arms and but expect command if glorious deeds afford thy soul delight behold me plunging in the thickest fight

and dared to combat all those chiefs around dared and subdued before their haughty lord for pallas strung his arm and edged his sword
to bar his passage fifty warriors lay two heroes led the secret squadron on mason the fierce and hardy lycophon those fifty slaughter in the gloomy vale
the tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found stung with the shame within the winding way he spared but one to bear the dreadful tale such tydeus was and such his martial fire
but heard respectful and in secret burn not so fierce capaneus undaunted son stern_hector as his sire the boaster thus begun what needs monarch
gods how the son degenerates from the sire no word the godlike diomed return this invidious praise ourselves to lessen while our sire you raise
dare to be just atrides and confess our value equal though our fury less with fewer troops we storm the theban wall and happier saw the sevenfold city fall
in impious acts the guilty father died the son subdued for heaven was on their side far more than heirs of all our parents fame our glories darken their diminish name
his high concern may well excuse this rage whose cause we follow and whose war we wage his the first praise were ilion towers erthrown and if we fail the chief disgrace his own
to him tydides thus my friend forbear suppress thy passion and the king revere let him the greeks to hardy toils excite tis ours to labour in the glorious fight
he spoke and ardent on the trembling ground sprung from his car his ringing arms resound dire was the clang and dreadful from afar of arm tydides rushing to the war
as when the winds ascending by degrees first move the whitening surface of the sea the billows float in order to the shore the wave behind rolls on the wave before till with the growing storm the deeps arise foam er the rocks and thunder to the skies
so to the fight the thick battalions throng shields urged on shields and men drove men along sedate and silent move the numerous bands
no sound no whisper but the chief commands those only heard with awe the rest obey as if some god had snatch their voice away
as when the fleecy flocks unnumber stand in wealthy folds and wait the milker hand the hollow vales incessant bleating fills the lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills such clamours rose from various nations round mix was the murmur and confused the sound
each host now joins and each a god inspires these mars incites and those minerva fires pale flight around and dreadful terror reign and discord raging bathes the purple plain discord
not so the trojans from their host ascends a general shout that all the region rends dire sister of the slaughtering power
small at her birth but rising every hour while scarce the skies her horrid head can bound she stalks on earth and shakes the world around
the nations bleed where er her steps she turns the groan still deepens and the combat burns now shield with shield with helmet helmet closed to armour armour lance to lance opposed
host against host with shadowy squadrons drew the sounding darts in iron tempests flew victors and vanquish join promiscuous cries and shrilling shouts and dying groans arise with streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed and slaughter heroes swell the dreadful tide
as torrents roll increased by numerous rills with rage impetuous down their echoing hills rush to the vales and pour along the plain
roar through a thousand channels to the main the distant shepherd trembling hears the sound so mix both hosts and so their cries rebound
the bold antilochus the slaughter led the first who struck a valiant trojan dead at great echepolus the lance arrives razed his high crest and through his helmet drives warm in the brain the brazen weapon lies and shades eternal settle er his eyes
so sinks a tower that long assaults had stood of force and fire its walls besmear with blood him the bold leader of the abantian throng seized to despoil and dragg the corpse along
his flank unguarded by his ample shield admits the lance he falls and spurns the field the nerves unbraced support his limbs no more the soul comes floating in a tide of gore
trojans and greeks now gather round the slain the war renews the warriors bleed again as er their prey rapacious wolves engage man dies on man and all is blood and rage
but while he strove to tug the inserted dart agenor javelin reach the hero heart in blooming youth fair simoisius fell sent by great oilean_ajax to the shades of hell
fair simoisius whom his mother bore amid the flocks on silver simois shore the nymph descending from the hills of ide to seek her parents on his flowery side brought forth the babe their common care and joy and thence from simois named the lovely boy
so falls a poplar that in watery ground raised high the head with stately branches crown fell by some artist with his shining steel to shape the circle of the bending wheel cut down it lies tall smooth and largely spread with all its beauteous honours on its head there left a subject to the wind and rain and scorch by suns it withers on the plain
short was his date by dreadful oilean_ajax slain he falls and renders all their cares in vain thus pierced by oilean_ajax simoisius lies
stretch on the shore and thus neglected dies at oilean_ajax antiphus his javelin threw the pointed lance with erring fury flew and leucus loved by wise_nestor ulysses slew
this saw ulysses and with grief enraged strode where the foremost of the foes engaged arm with his spear he meditates the wound
in act to throw but cautious look around struck at his sight the trojans backward drew and trembling heard the javelin as it flew
he drops the corpse of simoisius slain and sinks a breathless carcase on the plain a chief stood nigh who from abydos came old priam son democoon was his name
the weapon entered close above his ear cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear with piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath his eye balls darken with the shades of death ponderous he falls
seized with affright the boldest foes appear en godlike stern_hector seems himself to fear slow he gave way the rest tumultuous fled the greeks with shouts press on and spoil the dead but phoebus now from ilion towering height shines forth reveal and animates the fight
his clanging arms resound and his broad buckler rings against the ground trojans be bold and force with force oppose
your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes nor are their bodies rocks nor ribb with steel your weapons enter and your strokes they feel
have ye forgot what seem your dread before the great the fierce achilles fights no more apollo thus from ilion lofty towers array in terrors roused the trojan powers
while war fierce goddess fires the grecian foe and shouts and thunders in the fields below then great diores fell by doom divine in vain his valour and illustrious line

supine he tumbles on the crimson sands before his helpless friends and native bands and spreads for aid his unavailing hands
the ponderous stone burst the strong nerves and crash the solid bone the foe rush furious as he pants for breath
and through his navel drove the pointed death his gushing entrails smoked upon the ground and the warm life came issuing from the wound
his lance bold thoas at the conqueror sent deep in his breast above the pap it went amid the lungs was fix the winged wood and quivering in his heaving bosom stood
till from the dying chief approaching near the ćtolian warrior tugg his weighty spear then sudden waved his flaming falchion round
to spoil his arms the victor strove in vain the thracian bands against the victor press a grove of lances glitter at his breast
and gash his belly with a ghastly wound the corpse now breathless on the bloody plain stern_hector thoas glaring with revengeful eyes in sullen fury slowly quits the prize
thus fell two heroes one the pride of thrace and one the leader of the epeian race death sable shade at once ercast their eyes in dust the vanquish and the victor lies
had some brave chief this martial scene beheld by pallas guarded through the dreadful field might darts be bid to turn their points away and swords around him innocently play the war whole art with wonder had he seen and counted heroes where he counted men
with copious slaughter all the fields are red and heap with growing mountain of the dead so fought each host with thirst of glory fired
and crowds on crowds triumphantly expired illustration map of the plain of troy map of the plain of troy book argument
pandarus wounds him with an arrow but the goddess cures him enables him to discern gods from mortals and prohibits him from contending with any of the former excepting venus
ćneas joins pandarus to oppose him pandarus is killed and ćneas in great danger but for the assistance of venus who as she is removing her son from the fight is wounded on the hand by diomed
apollo seconds her in his rescue and at length carries off ćneas to troy where he is healed in the temple of pergamus
the acts of diomed diomed assisted by pallas performs wonders in this day battle mars rallies the trojans and assists stern_hector to make a stand
in the meantime ćneas is restored to the field and they overthrow several of the greeks among the rest tlepolemus is slain by sarpedon
juno and minerva descend to resist mars the latter incites diomed to go against that god he wounds him and sends him groaning to heaven
the first battle continues through this book the scene is the same as in the former but pallas now tydides soul inspires
fills with her force and warms with all her fires above the greeks his deathless fame to raise and crown her hero with distinguish praise
high on his helm celestial lightnings play his beamy shield emits a living ray the unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies like the red star that fires the autumnal skies when fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight and bathed in ocean shoots a keener light
such glories pallas on the chief bestow such from his arms the fierce effulgence flow onward she drives him furious to engage where the fight burns and where the thickest rage
the son of dares first the combat sought a wealthy priest but rich without a fault in vulcan fane the father days were led the son to toils of glorious battle bred these singled from their troops the fight maintain these from their steeds tydides on the plain
fierce for renown the brother chiefs draw near and first bold phegeus cast his sounding spear which er the warrior shoulder took its course and spent in empty air its erring force
not so tydides flew thy lance in vain but pierced his breast and stretch him on the plain seized with unusual fear idaeus fled left the rich chariot and his brother dead
and had not vulcan lent celestial aid he too had sunk to death eternal shade but in a smoky cloud the god of fire preserved the son in pity to the sire
struck with amaze and shame the trojan crew or slain or fled the son of dares view when by the blood stain hand minerva
the steeds and chariot to the navy led increased the spoil of gallant diomed press the god of battles and this speech address stern_hector power of war

then died scamandrius expert in the chase in woods and wilds to wound the savage race diana taught him all her sylvan arts to bend the bow and aim unerring darts
but vainly here diana arts he tries the fatal lance arrests him as he flies from great_menelaus arm the weapon sent through his broad back and heaving bosom went
from fruitful tarne to the fields of troy down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound his brazen armour rings against the ground

down sunk the priest the purple hand of death closed his dim eye and fate suppress his breath thus toil the chiefs in different parts engaged
in every quarter fierce tydides raged amid the greek amid the trojan train rapt through the ranks he thunders er the plain now here now there he darts from place to place
pours on the rear or lightens in their face thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong deluge whole fields and sweep the trees along
through ruin moles the rushing wave resounds erwhelm the bridge and bursts the lofty bounds the yellow harvests of the ripen year and flatted vineyards one sad waste appear
while which_jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain and all the labours of mankind are vain so raged tydides boundless in his ire drove armies back and made all troy retire
with grief the leader of the lycian band saw the wide waste of his destructive hand his bended bow against the chief he drew swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore
deep in his shoulder pierced and drank the gore the rushing stream his brazen armour dyed while the proud archer thus exulting cried hither ye trojans hither drive your steeds
by our hand the bravest grecian bleeds not long the deathful dart he can sustain or phoebus urged me to these fields in vain
lo so spoke he boastful but the winged dart stopp short of life and mock the shooter art the wounded chief behind his car retired the helping hand of sthenelus required
swift from his seat he leap upon the ground and tugg the weapon from the gushing wound when thus the king his guardian power address the purple current wandering er
if er my godlike sire deserved thy aid if er i felt thee in the fighting field now goddess now thy sacred succour yield
his vest progeny of which_jove unconquer maid give my lance to reach the trojan knight whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard st in fight
thus pray tydides and minerva heard his nerves confirm his languid spirits cheer he feels each limb with wonted vigour light
and lay the boaster grovelling on the shore that vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more his beating bosom claim the promised fight
in every combat shine war be thy province thy protection mine rush to the fight and every foe control wake each paternal virtue in thy soul strength swells thy boiling breast infused by me and all thy godlike father breathes in thee yet more from mortal mists
be bold she cried i purge thy eyes and set to view the warring deities these see thou shun through all the embattled plain nor rashly strive where human force is vain
if venus mingle in the martial band her shalt thou wound so pallas gives command with that the blue eyed virgin wing her flight
the hero rush impetuous to the fight with tenfold ardour now invades the plain wild with delay and more enraged by pain
as on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls amidst the field a brindled lion falls if chance some shepherd with a distant dart the savage wound he rouses at the smart
he foams he roars the shepherd dares not stay but trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey heaps fall on heaps he bathes with blood the ground then leaps victorious er the lofty mound
and two brave leaders at an instant slew astynous breathless fell and by his side his people pastor good hypenor died astynous breast the deadly lance receives hypenor shoulder his broad falchion cleaves
those slain he left and sprung with noble rage abas and polyidus to engage son of eurydamus who wise_nestor and old could fate foresee and mystic dreams unfold the youths return not from the doubtful plain and the sad father tried his arts in vain no mystic dream could make their fate appear though now determined by tydides spear
young xanthus next and thoon felt his rage the joy and hope of phaenops feeble age vast was his wealth and these the only heirs of all his labours and a life of cares
cold death ertakes them in their blooming years and leaves the father unavailing tears to strangers now descends his heapy store the race forgotten and the name no more
not with less fury stern_hector tydides flew two son of priam in one chariot ride glittering in arms and combat side by side
as when the lordly lion seeks his food where grazing heifers range the lonely wood he leaps amidst them with a furious bound
bends their strong necks and tears them to the ground so from their seats the brother chiefs are torn their steeds and chariot to the navy borne
the foe prevailing and his friends pursued through the thick storm of singing spears he flies exploring pandarus with careful eyes
at length he found lycaon mighty son to whom the chief of venus race begun where pandarus are all thy honours now thy winged arrows and unerring bow thy matchless skill thy yet unrivall fame and boasted glory of the lycian name
o pierce that mortal if we mortal call that wondrous force by which whole armies fall or god incensed who quits the distant skies to punish troy for slighted sacrifice which oh avert from our unhappy state
with deep concern divine ćneas view for what so dreadful as celestial hate whoe er he be propitiate which_jove with prayer if man destroy if god entreat to spare
to him the lycian whom your eyes behold if right i judge is diomed the bold such coursers whirl him er the dusty field so towers his helmet and so flames his shield
if tis a god he wears that chief disguise or if that chief some guardian of the skies involved in clouds protects him in the fray and turns unseen the frustrate dart away
i wing an arrow which not idly fell the stroke had fix him to the gates of hell and but some god some angry god withstands his fate was due to these unerring hands
skill in the bow on foot i sought the war nor join swift horses to the rapid car ten polish chariots i possess at home
and still they grace lycaon princely dome there veil in spacious coverlets they stand and twice ten coursers wait their lord command
the good old warrior bade me trust to these when first for troy i sail the sacred sea in fields aloft the whirling car to guide and through the ranks of death triumphant ride
but vain with youth and yet to thrift inclined i heard his counsels with unheedful mind and thought the steeds your large supplies unknown might fail of forage in the straiten town
so took my bow and pointed darts in hand and left the chariots in my native land too late friend
my rashness i deplore these shafts once fatal carry death no more tydeus and atreus son their points have found and undissembled gore pursued the wound
in vain they bleed this unavailing bow serves not to slaughter but provoke the foe in evil hour these bended horns i strung and seized the quiver where it idly hung
cursed be the fate that sent me to the field without a warrior arms the spear and shield if er with life i quit the trojan plain
if er i see my spouse and sire again this bow unfaithful to my glorious aims broke by my hand shall feed the blazing flames
to whom the leader of the dardan race be calm nor phoebus honour gift disgrace the distant dart be praised though here we need the rushing chariot and the bounding steed
now mount my seat and from the chariot height observe my father steeds renown in fight practised alike to turn to stop to chase to dare the shock or urge the rapid race secure with these through fighting fields we go or safe to troy if which_jove assist the foe
haste seize the whip and snatch the guiding rein the warrior fury let this arm sustain or if to combat thy bold heart incline take thou the spear the chariot care be mine
against yon hero let us bend our course and hand to hand encounter force with force prince lycaon valiant son replied
as thine the steeds be thine the task to guide the horses practised to their lord command shall bear the rein and answer to thy hand
but if unhappy we desert the fight thy voice alone can animate their flight else shall our fate be number with the dead and these the victor prize in triumph led
and now both heroes mount the glittering car the bounding coursers rush amidst the war their fierce approach bold sthenelus espied
thine be the guidance then with spear and shield myself will charge this terror of the field who thus alarm to great tydides cried friend
two chiefs of force immense i see dreadful they come and bend their rage on thee lo the brave heir of old lycaon line and great ćneas sprung from race divine
at this the hero cast a gloomy look fix on the chief with scorn and thus he spoke me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight
enough is given to fame ascend thy car and save a life the bulwark of our war me wouldst thou move to base inglorious flight
i hate the cumbrous chariot slow advance and the long distance of the flying lance but while my nerves are strong my force entire thus front the foe and emulate my sire
know tis not honest in my soul to fear nor was tydides born to tremble here nor shall yon steeds that fierce to fight convey those threatening heroes bear them both away
but if she dooms and if no god withstand that both shall fall by one victorious hand then heed my word my horses here detain fix to the chariot by the straiten rein swift to ćneas empty seat proceed and seize the coursers of ethereal breed the race of those which once the thundering god
one chief at least beneath this arm shall die so pallas tells me and forbids to fly for ravish ganymede on
hence great anchises stole a breed unknown by mortal mares from fierce laomedon four of this race his ample stalls contain and two transport ćneas er the plain
tros bestow the best that er on earth broad surface run beneath the rising or the setting sun these were the rich immortal prize our own
through the wide world should make our glory known thus while they spoke the foe came furious on and stern_hector lycaon warlike race begun prince thou art met
he said then shook the ponderous lance and flung on his broad shield the sounding weapon rung pierced the tough orb and in his cuirass hung he bleeds
though late in vain assail the spear may enter where the arrow fail the pride of greece the boaster cries
our triumph now the mighty warrior lies mistaken vaunter diomed replied thy dart has erred and now my spear be tried ye scape not both one headlong from his car
with hostile blood shall glut the god of war he spoke and rising hurl his forceful dart which driven by pallas pierced a vital part
full in his face it enter and betwixt the nose and eye ball the proud lycian fix crash all his jaws and cleft the tongue within till the bright point look out beneath the chin
headlong he falls his helmet knocks the ground earth groans beneath him and his arms resound the starting coursers tremble with affright the soul indignant seeks the realms of night
to guard his slaughter friend ćneas flies his spear extending where the carcase lies watchful he wheels protects it every way
as the grim lion stalks around his prey er the fall trunk his ample shield display he hides the hero with his mighty shade and threats aloud
the greeks with longing eyes behold at distance but forbear the prize then fierce tydides stoops and from the fields heaved with vast force a rocky fragment wields
not two strong men the enormous weight could raise such men as live in these degenerate days he swung it round and gathering strength to throw discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe
full on the bone the pointed marble lights through both the tendons broke the rugged stone and stripp the skin and crack the solid bone
sunk on his knees and staggering with his pains his falling bulk his bended arm sustains lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies a sudden cloud comes swimming er his eyes
there the brave chief who mighty numbers sway oppress had sunk to death eternal shade but heavenly venus mindful of the love she bore anchises in the idaean grove his danger views with anguish and despair and guards her offspring with a mother care
where to the hip the inserted thigh unites about her much loved son her arms she throws her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows
screen from the foe behind her shining veil the swords wave harmless and the javelins fail safe through the rushing horse and feather flight of sounding shafts she bears him from the fight
nor sthenelus with unassisting hands remain unheedful of his lord commands his panting steeds removed from out the war he fix with straiten traces to the car
next rushing to the dardan spoil detains the heavenly coursers with the flowing manes these in proud triumph to the fleet convey
no longer now a trojan lord obey that charge to bold deipylus he gave whom most he loved as brave men love the brave
then mounting on his car resumed the rein and follow where tydides swept the plain meanwhile his conquest ravished from his eyes
commission to the field like pallas dreadful with her sable shield or fierce bellona thundering at the wall while flames ascend and mighty ruins fall he knew soft combats suit the tender dame
the raging chief in chase of venus flies no goddess she new to the field and still a foe to fame
through breaking ranks his furious course he bends and at the goddess his broad lance extends through her bright veil the daring weapon drove
the ambrosial veil which all the graces wove her snowy hand the razing steel profaned and the transparent skin with crimson
stain from the clear vein a stream immortal flow such stream as issues from a wounded god pure emanation uncorrupted flood
unlike our gross diseased terrestrial blood for not the bread of man their life sustains nor wine inflaming juice supplies their veins
with tender shrieks the goddess fill the place and dropp her offspring from her weak embrace him phoebus took he casts a cloud around the fainting chief and wards the mortal wound
ill with which_jove daughter bloody fights agree the field of combat is no scene for thee go let thy own soft sex employ thy care
then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies the king insults the goddess as she flies go lull the coward or delude the fair
taught by this stroke renounce the war alarms and learn to tremble at the name of arms tydides thus the goddess seized with dread confused distracted from the conflict fled
to aid her swift the winged iris flew wrapt in a mist above the warring crew the queen of love with faded charms she found
far on the left with clouds involved he lay beside him stood his lance distain with gore and rein with gold his foaming steeds before
pale was her cheek and livid look the wound to mars who sat remote they bent their way low at his knee she begg with streaming eyes her brother car to mount the distant skies
stern_hector mars attentive hears the queen complain and to her hand commits the golden rein she mounts the seat oppress with silent woe
and show the wound by fierce tydides given a mortal man who dares encounter heaven driven by the goddess of the painted bow
they stopp the car and there the coursers stood fed by fair iris with ambrosial food before her mother love bright queen appears erwhelmed with anguish and dissolved in tears she raised her in her arms beheld her bleed
the lash resounds the rapid chariot flies and in a moment scales the lofty skies and ask what god had wrought this guilty deed
illustration venus wounded in the hand conducted by iris to mars venus wounded in the hand conducted by iris to mars
then she this insult from no god i found an impious mortal gave the daring wound behold the deed of haughty diomed
twas in the son defence the mother bled the war with troy no more the grecians wage but with the gods the immortal gods engage
dione then thy wrongs with patience bear and share those griefs inferior powers must share unnumber woes mankind from us sustain and men with woes afflict the gods again
the mighty mars in mortal fetters bound and lodged in brazen dungeons underground full thirteen moons imprison roar in vain otus and ephialtes held the chain perhaps had perish d
great juno self has borne her weight of pain the imperial partner of the heavenly reign amphitryon son infix the deadly dart
had not hermes care restored the groaning god to upper air and fill with anguish her immortal heart en hell grim king
the shaft found entrance in his iron breast to which_jove high palace for a cure he fled pierced in his own dominions of the dead where paeon sprinkling heavenly balm around assuaged the glowing pangs and closed the wound
alcides power confess rash impious man to stain the bless abodes and drench his arrows in the blood of gods illustration otus and ephialtes holding mars captive
but thou though pallas urged thy frantic deed whose spear ill fated makes a goddess bleed know thou whoe er with heavenly power contends short is his date and soon his glory end
otus and ephialtes holding mars captive from fields of death when late he shall retire no infant on his knees shall call him sire
strong as thou art some god may yet be found to stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground thy distant wife ćgiale the fair starting from sleep with a distracted air shall rouse thy slave and her lost lord deplore the brave the great the glorious now no more
this said she wiped from venus wounded palm the sacred ichor and infused the balm juno and pallas with a smile survey
to tell how this mischance the cyprian queen befell as late she tried with passion to inflame the tender bosom of a grecian dame
allured the fair with moving thought of joy to quit her country for some youth of troy the clasping zone with golden buckles bound razed her soft hand with this lamented wound
the sire of gods and men superior smiled and calling venus thus address his child not these daughter are thy proper cares thee milder arts befit and softer wars sweet smiles are thine and kind endearing charms to mars and pallas leave the deeds of arms
thus they in heaven while on the plain below the fierce tydides charged his dardan foe flush with celestial blood pursued his way and fearless dared the threatening god of day already in his hopes he saw him kill though screen behind apollo mighty shield
thrice rushing furious at the chief he strook his blazing buckler thrice apollo shook he tried the fourth when breaking from the cloud a more than mortal voice was heard aloud
and thus to which_jove began the blue eyed maid permit thy daughter gracious which_jove son of tydeus cease be wise_nestor and see how vast the difference of the gods and thee
distance immense between the powers that shine above eternal deathless and divine and mortal man a wretch of humble birth a short lived reptile in the dust of earth
so spoke the god who darts celestial fires he dreads his fury and some steps retires then phoebus bore the chief of venus race to troy high fane and to his holy place
this done the patron of the silver bow a phantom raised the same in shape and show with great ćneas such the form he bore and such in fight the radiant arms he wore
latona there and phoebe heal the wound with vigour arm him and with glory crown around the spectre bloody wars are waged and greece and troy with clashing shields engaged
stern_hector power of arms by whom the mighty fall who bathest in blood and shakest the embattled wall rise in thy wrath
meantime on ilion tower apollo stood and calling mars thus urged the raging god to hell abhorr abodes despatch yon greek and vindicate the gods
first rosy venus felt his brutal rage me next he charged and dares all heaven engage the wretch would brave high heaven immortal sire his triple thunder and his bolts of fire
the god of battle issues on the plain stirs all the ranks and fires the trojan train in form like acamas the thracian guide enraged to troy retiring chiefs he cried how long ye son of priam will ye fly and
unrevenged see priam people die still unresisted shall the foe destroy and stretch the slaughter to the gates of troy
lo brave ćneas sinks beneath his wound not godlike stern_hector more in arms renown haste all and take the generous warrior part
he said new courage swell each hero heart sarpedon first his ardent soul express and turn to stern_hector these bold word address say chief is all thy ancient valour lost
where are thy threats and where thy glorious boast that propp alone by priam race should stand troy sacred walls nor need a foreign hand
now now thy country calls her wonted friends and the proud vaunt in just derision end remote they stand while alien troops engage like trembling hounds before the lion rage
far distant hence i held my wide command where foaming xanthus laves the lycian land with ample wealth the wish of mortals bless a beauteous wife and infant at her breast with those i left whatever dear could be greece if she conquers nothing wins from me
yet first in fight my lycian bands i cheer and long to meet this mighty man ye fear while stern_hector idle stands nor bids the brave their wife their infant and their altars save
haste warrior haste preserve thy threaten state or one vast burst of all involving fate full er your towers shall fall and sweep away son sires and wife an undistinguish prey
rouse all thy trojans urge thy aids to fight these claim thy thought by day thy watch by night with force incessant the brave greeks oppose such cares thy friends deserve and such thy foes
stung to the heart the generous stern_hector hears but just reproof with decent silence bears from his proud car the prince impetuous springs on earth he leaps his brazen armour rings
two shining spears are brandish in his hands thus arm he animates his drooping bands revives their ardour turns their steps from flight and wakes anew the dying flames of fight
as when on ceres sacred floor the swain spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain and the light chaff before the breezes borne ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn the grey dust rising with collected winds drives er the barn and whitens all the hinds so white with dust the grecian host appears
from trampling steeds and thundering charioteers the dusky clouds from labour earth arise and roll in smoking volumes to the skies
they turn they stand the greeks their fury dare condense their powers and wait the growing war mars hovers er them with his sable shield and adds new horrors to the darken field
pleased with his charge and ardent to fulfil in troy defence apollo heavenly will soon as from fight the blue eyed maid retires each trojan bosom with new warmth he fires
and now the god from forth his sacred fane produced ćneas to the shouting train alive unharm with all his peers around
inquiries none they made the dreadful day no pause of word admits no dull delay fierce discord storms apollo loud exclaims fame calls mars thunders and the field in flames
erect he stood and vigorous from his wound stern_hector diomed with either oilean_ajax stood and great ulysses bathed in hostile blood
embodied close the labouring grecian train the fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain unmoved and silent the whole war they wait serenely dreadful and as fix as fate
so when the embattled clouds in dark array along the skies their gloomy lines display when now the north his boisterous rage has spent and peaceful sleeps the liquid element
the low hung vapours motionless and still rest on the summits of the shaded hill till the mass scatters as the winds arise dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies
nor was the general wanting to his train from troop to troop he toils through all the plain ye greeks be men
the charge of battle bear your brave associates and yourselves revere let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire and catch from breast to breast the noble fire
on valour side the odds of combat lie the brave live glorious or lamented die the wretch who trembles in the field of fame meets death and worse than death eternal shame
these word he seconds with his flying lance to meet whose point was strong deicoon chance ćneas friend and in his native place honour and loved like priam royal race long had he fought the foremost in the field but now the monarch lance transpierced his shield his shield too weak the furious dart to stay through his broad belt the weapon forced its way
the grisly wound dismiss his soul to hell his arms around him rattled as he fell then fierce ćneas brandishing his blade in dust orsilochus and crethon laid whose sire diocleus wealthy brave and great
in well built pherae held his lofty seat sprung from alpheus plenteous stream that yields increase of harvests to the pylian fields
in sable ships they left their native soil to avenge atrides now untimely slain they fell with glory on the phrygian plain
he got orsilochus diocleus he and these descended in the third degree too early expert in the martial toil so two young mountain lions nursed with blood
in deep recesses of the gloomy wood rush fearless to the plains and uncontroll depopulate the stalls and waste the fold
till pierced at distance from their native den erpowered they fall beneath the force of men prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay like mountain firs as tall and straight as they
great_menelaus views with pitying eyes lifts his bright lance and at the victor flies mars urged him on yet ruthless in his hate
he thus advancing wise_nestor valiant son shakes for his danger and neglects his own struck with the thought should argive_helen lord be slain and all his country glorious labours vain

antilochus his aid to bring and fall or conquer by the spartan king these seen the dardan backward turn his course brave as he was and shunn unequal force
the breathless bodies to the greeks they drew then mix in combat and their toils renew first pylaemenes great in battle bled
who sheathed in brass the paphlagonians led atrides mark him where sublime he stood fix in his throat the javelin drank his blood
the faithful mydon as he turn from fight his flying coursers sunk to endless night a broken rock by wise_nestor son was thrown his bended arm received the falling stone from his numb hand the ivory studded reins dropp in the dust are trail along the plains
meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound he groans in death and ponderous sinks to ground deep drove his helmet in the sands and there the head stood fix the quivering legs in air
till trampled flat beneath the coursers feet the youthful victor mounts his empty seat and bears the prize in triumph to the fleet
the trojan troops pursue he fires his host with animating cries and brings along the furies of the skies mars stern_hector destroyer
great stern_hector saw and raging at the view pours on the greeks and bellona dread flame in the front and thunder at their head
this swells the tumult and the rage of fight that shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light where stern_hector march the god of battles shined now storm before him and now raged behind
as when some simple swain his cot forsakes and wide through fens an unknown journey takes if chance a swelling brook his passage stay and foam impervious cross the wanderer way confused he stops a length of country pass eyes the rough waves and tired returns at last
tydides paused amidst his full career then first the hero manly breast knew fear amazed no less the great tydides stands
no wonder greeks that all to stern_hector yield secure of favouring gods he takes the field his strokes they second and avert our spears
he stay and turning thus address his bands behold where mars in mortal arms appears retire then warriors but sedate and slow retire but with your faces to the foe
now near the greeks the black battalions drew and first two leaders valiant stern_hector slew his force anchialus and mnesthes found
trust not too much your unavailing might tis not with troy but with the gods ye fight in every art of glorious war renown d
in the same car the chiefs to combat ride and fought united and united died struck at the sight the mighty oilean_ajax glows with thirst of vengeance and assaults the foes
possess with herds abounding and with treasure bless but fate resistless from his country led the chief to perish at his people head
shook with his fall his brazen armour rung and fierce to seize it conquering oilean_ajax sprung around his head an iron tempest rain a wood of spears his ample shield sustain
his massy spear with matchless fury sent through amphius belt and heaving belly went amphius apaesus happy soil beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press
and drew his javelin from the bleeding breast he could no more the showering darts denied to spoil his glittering arms and plumy pride
now foes on foes came pouring on the fields with bristling lances and compacted shields till in the steely circle straiten round forced he gives way and sternly quits the ground
while thus they strive tlepolemus the great urged by the force of unresisted fate burns with desire sarpedon strength to prove
alcides offspring meets the son of which_jove sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on which_jove great descendant and his greater son
prepared for combat ere the lance he toss the daring rhodian vents his haughty boast what brings this lycian counsellor so far to tremble at our arms not mix in war
know thy vain self nor let their flattery move who style thee son of cloud compelling which_jove how far unlike those chiefs of race
divine how vast the difference of their deeds and thine which_jove got such heroes as my sire whose soul no fear could daunt nor earth nor hell control
troy felt his arm and yon proud ramparts stand raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand with six small ships and but a slender train he left the town a wide deserted plain
but what art thou who deedless look st around while unrevenged thy lycians bite the ground small aid to troy thy feeble force can be
but wert thou greater thou must yield to me pierced by my spear to endless darkness go i make this present to the shades below
the son of hercules the rhodian guide thus haughty spoke the lycian king replied thy sire prince erturn the trojan state
whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far false he detain the just reward of war
but you unworthy the high race you boast shall raise my glory when thy own is lost now meet thy fate and by sarpedon slain add one more ghost to pluto gloomy reign
nor so content the generous chief defied with base reproaches and unmanly pride he said both javelins at an instant flew both struck both wounded but sarpedon slew
full in the boaster neck the weapon stood transfix his throat and drank the vital blood the soul disdainful seeks the caves of night and his seal eyes for ever lose the light
yet not in vain tlepolemus was thrown thy angry lance which piercing to the bone sarpedon thigh had robb the chief of breath
but which_jove was present and forbade the death borne from the conflict by his lycian throng the wounded hero dragg the lance along
his friends each busied in his several part through haste or danger had not drawn the dart the greeks with slain tlepolemus retired
whose fall ulysses view with fury fired doubtful if which_jove great son he should pursue or pour his vengeance on the lycian crew
but heaven and fate the first design withstand nor this great death must grace ulysses hand minerva drives him on the lycian train alastor cronius halius strew the plain alcander prytanis noemon fell
and numbers more his sword had sent to hell but stern_hector saw and furious at the sight rush terrible amidst the ranks of fight
with joy sarpedon view the wish relief and faint lamenting thus implored the chief suffer not the foe to bear away
if i unbless must see my son no more my much loved consort and my native shore yet let me die in ilion sacred wall troy in whose cause i fell shall mourn my fall
my helpless corpse an unassisted prey he said nor stern_hector to the chief replies but shakes his plume and fierce to combat flies
swift as a whirlwind drives the scattering foes and dyes the ground with purple as he goes beneath a beech which_jove consecrated shade his mournful friends divine sarpedon laid brave pelagon his favourite chief was nigh
who wrench the javelin from his sinewy thigh the fainting soul stood ready wing for flight and er his eye balls swam the shades of night
the generous greeks recede with tardy pace though mars and stern_hector thunder in their face none turn their backs to mean ignoble flight slow they retreat and even retreating fight
but boreas rising fresh with gentle breath recall his spirit from the gates of death who first who last by mars and stern_hector hand stretch in their blood lay gasping on the sand

tenthras the great orestes the the carnage juno from the skies survey and touch with grief bespoke the blue eyed maid oh sight accursed

this from his pledge i learn which safely stored among my treasures still adorns my board for tydeus left me young when thebe wall beheld the son of greece untimely fall
mindful of this in friendship let us join if heaven our steps to foreign lands incline my guest in argos thou and i in lycia thine
enough of trojans to this lance shall yield in the full harvest of yon ample field enough of greeks shall dye thy spear with gore
but thou and diomed be foes no more now change we arms and prove to either host we guard the friendship of the line we boast
thus having said the gallant chiefs alight their hands they join their mutual faith they plight brave glaucus then each narrow thought resign which_jove warm his bosom and enlarged his mind
for diomed brass arms of mean device for which nine oxen paid a vulgar price he gave his own of gold divinely wrought
a hundred beeves the shining purchase bought meantime the guardian of the trojan state great stern_hector enter at the scaean gate
beneath the beech tree consecrated shades the trojan matrons and the trojan maids around him flock all press with pious care for husbands brothers son engaged in war
he bids the train in long procession go and seek the gods to avert the impending woe and now to priam stately courts he came rais on arch columns of stupendous frame
er these a range of marble structure runs the rich pavilions of his fifty son in fifty chambers lodged and rooms of state
opposed to those where priam daughters sate twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone of equal beauty and of polish stone
hither great stern_hector pass nor pass unseen of royal hecuba his mother queen with her laodice whose beauteous face surpass the nymphs of troy illustrious race
stern_hector say what great occasion calls my son from fight when greece surrounds our walls com st thou to supplicate the almighty power with lifted hands from ilion lofty tower
long in a strict embrace she held her son and press his hand and tender thus begun stay till i bring the cup with
then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul and draw new spirits from the generous bowl spent as thou art with long laborious fight the brave defender of thy country right
bacchus crown in which_jove high name to sprinkle on the ground and pay due vows to all the gods around far hence be bacchus gifts the chief rejoin
inflaming wine pernicious to mankind unnerves the limbs and dulls the noble mind let chiefs abstain and spare the sacred juice to sprinkle to the gods its better use
by me that holy office were profaned ill fits it me with human gore distain to the pure skies these horrid hands to raise or offer heaven great sire polluted praise
the largest mantle your full wardrobes hold most prized for art and labour o er with gold before the goddess honour knees be spread and twelve young heifers to her altar led
so may the power atoned by fervent prayer our wife our infant and our city spare and far avert tydides wasteful ire
you with your matrons go a spotless train and burn rich odours in minerva fane who mows whole troops and makes all troy retire
be this mother your religious care i go to rouse soft paris to the war if yet not lost to all the sense of shame the recreant warrior hear the voice of fame
oh would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace that pest of troy that ruin of our race deep to the dark abyss might he descend troy yet should flourish and my sorrows end
this heard she gave command and summon came each noble matron and illustrious dame the phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went where treasured odours breathed a costly scent
there lay the vestures of no vulgar art sidonian maids embroider every part whom from soft sidon youthful paris bore with argive_helen touching on the tyrian shore
the various textures and the various dyes she chose a veil that shone superior far and glow refulgent as the morning star
here as the queen revolved with careful eyes herself with this the long procession leads the train majestically slow proceeds soon as to ilion topmost tower they come and awful reach
the high palladian dome antenor consort fair theano waits as pallas priestess and unbars the gates with hands uplifted and imploring eyes they fill the dome with supplicating cries
the priestess then the shining veil displays placed on minerva knees and thus she prays oh awful goddess ever dreadful maid troy strong defence unconquer pallas aid
break thou tydides spear and let him fall prone on the dust before the trojan wall so twelve young heifers guiltless of the yoke shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke
but thou atoned by penitence and prayer ourselves our infant and our city spare so pray the priestess in her holy fane so vow the matrons but they vow in vain
while these appear before the power with prayers stern_hector to paris lofty dome repairs himself the mansion raised from every part assembling architects of matchless art
near priam court and stern_hector palace stands the pompous structure and the town commands a spear the hero bore of wondrous strength of full ten cubits was the lance length
before him brandish at each motion shined thus entering in the glittering rooms he found his brother chief whose useless arms lay round his eyes delighting with their splendid show brightening the shield and polishing the bow
the steely point with golden ringlets join beside him argive_helen with her virgins stands guides their rich labours and instructs their hands
him thus inactive with an ardent look the prince beheld and high resenting spoke thy hate to troy is this the time to show
wretch ill fated and thy country foe paris and greece against us both conspire thy close resentment and their vengeful ire
for thee great ilion guardian heroes fall till heaps of dead alone defend her wall for thee the soldier bleeds the matron mourns and wasteful war in all its fury burns
ungrateful man deserves not this thy care our troops to hearten and our toils to share rise or behold the conquering flames ascend and all the phrygian glories at an end
brother tis just replied the beauteous youth thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth yet charge my absence less generous chief
on hate to troy than conscious shame and grief here hid from human eyes thy brother sate and mourn in secret his and ilion fate
tis now enough now glory spreads her charms and beauteous argive_helen calls her chief to arms conquest to day my happier sword may bless tis man to fight but heaven to give success
but while i arm contain thy ardent mind or go and paris shall not lag behind illustration stern_hector chiding paris
stern_hector chiding paris he said nor answer priam warlike son when argive_helen thus with lowly grace begun oh generous brother if the guilty dame that caused these woes deserve a sister name
would heaven ere all these dreadful deeds were done the day that show me to the golden sun had seen my death
why did not whirlwinds bear the fatal infant to the fowls of air why sunk i not beneath the whelming tide and midst the roarings of the waters died
heaven fill up all my ills and i accursed bore all and paris of those ills the worst argive_helen at least a braver spouse might claim warm with some virtue some regard of fame
the gods have link our miserable doom our present woe and infamy to come wide shall it spread and last through ages long example sad
now tired with toils thy fainting limbs recline with toils sustain for paris sake and mine and theme of future song
the chief replied this time forbids to rest the trojan bands by hostile fury press demand their stern_hector and his arm require the combat urges and my soul on fire
urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls and timely join me ere i leave the walls ere yet i mingle in the direful fray my wife my infant claim a moment stay
this day perhaps the last that sees me here demand a parting word a tender tear this day some god who hates our trojan land may vanquish stern_hector by a grecian hand
he said and pass with sad presaging heart to seek his spouse his soul far dearer part at home he sought her but he sought in vain she with one maid of all her menial train had hence retired and with her second joy the young astyanax the hope of troy pensive she stood on ilion towery height beheld the war and sicken at the sight there her sad eyes in vain her lord explore or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore
but he who found not whom his soul desired whose virtue charm him as her beauty fired stood in the gates and ask d
if to the fane she went where late the mourning matrons made resort or sought her sisters in the trojan court
what way she bent her parting step not to the court replied the attendant train nor mix with matrons to minerva fane
to ilion steepy tower she bent her way to mark the fortune of the doubtful day troy fled she heard before the grecian sword she heard and trembled for her absent lord
distracted with surprise she seem to fly fear on her cheek and sorrow her eye the nurse attended with her infant boy the young astyanax the hope of troy
stern_hector this heard return without delay swift through the town he trod his former way through streets of palaces and walks of state and met the mourner at the scaean gate
with haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair his blameless wife aetion wealthy heir cilician thebe great aetion sway
the nurse stood near in whose embraces press his only hope hung smiling at her breast whom each soft charm and early grace adorn
to this loved infant stern_hector gave the name scamandrius from scamander honour stream astyanax the trojans call the boy from his great father the defence of troy
silent the warrior smiled and pleased resign to tender passions all his mighty mind his beauteous princess cast a mournful look
and hippoplacus wide extended shade fair as the new born star that gilds the morn hung on his hand and then dejected spoke
her bosom laboured with a boding sigh and the big tear stood trembling in her eye illustration the meeting of stern_hector and andromache
the meeting of stern_hector and andromache too daring prince ah whither dost thou run ah too forgetful of thy wife and son
and think st thou not how wretched we shall be a widow i a helpless orphan he for sure such courage length of life denies and thou must fall thy virtue sacrifice
greece in her single heroes strove in vain now hosts oppose thee and thou must be slain grant me gods ere stern_hector meets his doom
all i can ask of heaven an early tomb so shall my days in one sad tenor run and end with sorrows as they first begun
no parent now remains my griefs to share no father aid no mother tender care the fierce achilles wrapt our walls in fire laid thebe waste and slew my warlike sire
stern_hector as he was he yet revered the dead his radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil and laid him decent on the funeral pile then raised a mountain where his bones were burn the mountain nymphs the rural tomb adorn which_jove sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow
by the same arm my seven brave brothers fell in one sad day beheld the gates of hell while the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed amid their fields the hapless heroes bled
my mother lived to wear the victor bands the queen of hippoplacia sylvan lands redeem too late she scarce beheld again her pleasing empire and her native plain when ah oppress by life consuming woe she fell a victim to diana bow
his fate compassion in the victor bred a barren shade and in his honour grow yet while my stern_hector still survives i see my father mother brethren all in thee alas
my parents brothers kindred all once more will perish if my stern_hector fall thy wife thy infant in thy danger share
that quarter most the skilful greeks annoy where yon wild fig trees join the wall of troy thou from this tower defend the important post there agamemnon points his dreadful host that pass tydides oilean_ajax strive to gain
oh prove a husband and a father care and there the vengeful spartan fires his train thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given or led by hopes or dictated from heaven
let others in the field their arms employ but stay my stern_hector here and guard his troy the chief replied that post shall be my care not that alone but all the works of war
how would the son of troy in arms renown and troy proud dames whose garments sweep the ground attaint the lustre of my former name should stern_hector basely quit the field of fame
my early youth was bred to martial pains my soul impels me to the embattled plains let me be foremost to defend the throne and guard my father glories and my own
yet come it will the day decreed by fate how my heart trembles while my tongue relates the day when thou imperial troy must bend and see thy warriors fall thy glories end
and yet no dire presage so wounds my mind my mother death the ruin of my kind not priam hoary hairs defiled with gore not all my brothers gasping on the shore
as thine andromache thy griefs i dread i see thee trembling weeping captive led in argive looms our battles to design and woes of which so large a part was thine
to bear the victor hard commands or bring the weight of waters from hyperia spring there while you groan beneath the load of life they cry behold the mighty stern_hector wife
some haughty greek who lives thy tears to see imbitters all thy woes by naming me the thought of glory past and present shame a thousand griefs shall waken at the name
may i lie cold before that dreadful day press with a load of monumental clay thy stern_hector wrapt in everlasting sleep shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep
thus having spoke the illustrious chief of troy stretch his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy the babe clung crying to his nurse breast scared at the dazzling helm and nodding crest
with secret pleasure each fond parent smiled and stern_hector hasted to relieve his child the glittering terrors from his brows unbound and placed the beaming helmet on the ground
then kiss the child and lifting high in air thus to the gods preferr a father prayer thou whose glory fills the ethereal throne and all ye deathless powers
grant him like me to purchase just renown to guard the trojans to defend the crown against his country foes the war to wage and rise the stern_hector of the future age
so when triumphant from successful toils of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoil whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim and say this chief transcends his father fame while pleased amidst the general shouts of troy his mother conscious heart erflows with joy
he spoke and fondly gazing on her charms restored the pleasing burden to her arms soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid hush to repose and with a smile survey
protect my son the troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear she mingled with a smile a tender tear the soften chief with kind compassion view
and dried the falling drops and thus pursued andromache my soul far better part why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart
no hostile hand can antedate my doom till fate condemns me to the silent tomb fix is the term to all the race of earth
and such the hard condition of our birth no force can then resist no flight can save all sink alike the fearful and the brave
no more but hasten to thy tasks at home there guide the spindle and direct the loom me glory summons to the martial scene the field of combat is the sphere for men
where heroes war the foremost place i claim the first in danger as the first in fame thus having said the glorious chief resumes his towery helmet black with shading plumes
his princess parts with a prophetic sigh unwilling parts and oft reverts her eye that stream at every look then moving slow sought her own palace and indulged her woe
there while her tears deplored the godlike man through all her train the soft infection ran the pious maids their mingled sorrows shed and mourn the living stern_hector as the dead
but now no longer deaf to honour call forth issues paris from the palace wall in brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray swift through the town the warrior bends his way
breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground pamper and proud he seeks the wonted tides and laves in height of blood his shining sides his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane dishevell o er his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the distant plain and springs exulting to his fields again
in arms refulgent as the god of day the son of priam glorying in his might rush forth with stern_hector to the fields of fight
the wanton courser thus with reins unbound with equal triumph sprightly bold and gay and now the warriors passing on the way the graceful paris first excused his stay
to whom the noble stern_hector thus replied chief in blood and now in arms allied thy power in war with justice none contest
known is thy courage and thy strength confess what pity sloth should seize a soul so brave or godlike paris live a woman slave
my heart weeps blood at what the trojans say and hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away haste then in all their glorious labours share for much they suffer for thy sake in war
these ills shall cease whene er by which_jove decree we crown the bowl to heaven and liberty while the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns and greece indignant through her sea returns
illustration bows and bow case bows and bow case illustration iris iris book vii argument the single combat of stern_hector and oilean_ajax
the battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of stern_hector minerva is under apprehensions for the greeks apollo seeing her descend from olympus joins her near the scaean gate
they agree to put off the general engagement for that day and incite stern_hector to challenge the greeks to a single combat
nine of the princes accepting the challenge the lot is cast and falls upon oilean_ajax these heroes after several attacks are parted by the night
the trojans calling a council antenor purposes the delivery of argive_helen to the greeks to which paris will not consent but offers to restore them her riches
priam sends a herald to make this offer and to demand a truce for burning the dead the last of which only is agreed to by agamemnon
when the funerals are performed the greeks pursuant to the advice of wise_nestor erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp flanked with towers and defended by a ditch and palisades
neptune testifies his jealousy at this work but is pacified by a promise from jupiter both armies pass the night in feasting but jupiter disheartens the trojans with thunder and other signs of his wrath
the three and twentieth day end with the duel of stern_hector and oilean_ajax the next day the truce is agreed another is taken up in the funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships
so that somewhat about three days is employed in this book the scene lies wholly in the field so spoke the guardian of the trojan state then rush impetuous through the scaean gate
as when to sailors labouring through the main that long have heaved the weary oar in vain which_jove bids at length the expected gales arise the gales blow grateful and the vessel flies
him paris follow to the dire alarms both breathing slaughter both resolved in arms so welcome these to troy desiring train the bands are cheer the war awakes again
bold paris first the work of death begun on great menestheus areithous son sprung from the fair philomeda embrace the pleasing arne was his native place
then sunk eioneus to the shades below beneath his steely casque he felt the blow full on his neck from stern_hector weighty hand and roll with limbs relax along the land
by glaucus spear the bold iphmous bleeds fix in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds headlong he tumbles his slack nerves unbound
drop the cold useless members on the ground when now minerva saw her argives slain from vast olympus to the gleaming plain
fierce she descends apollo marked her flight nor shot less swift from ilion towery height radiant they met beneath the beechen shade when thus apollo to the blue eyed maid
what cause daughter of almighty which_jove thus wings thy progress from the realms above once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way to give to greece the long divided day
too much has troy already felt thy hate now breathe thy rage and hush the stern_hector debate this day the business of the field suspend war soon shall kindle and great ilion bend since vengeful goddesses confederate join to raze her walls though built by hands divine
to whom the progeny of which_jove replies i left for this the council of the skies but who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear what art shall calm the furious son of war
to her the god great stern_hector soul incite to dare the boldest greek to single fight till greece provoked from all her numbers show a warrior worthy to be stern_hector foe
at this agreed the heavenly powers withdrew sage helenus their secret counsels knew stern_hector inspired he sought to him address
thus told the dictates of his sacred breast son of priam let thy faithful ear receive my word thy friend and brother hear
go forth persuasive and a while engage the warring nations to suspend their rage then dare the boldest of the hostile train to mortal combat on the listed plain
he said the warrior heard the word with joy then with his spear restrain the youth of troy held by the midst athwart
for not this day shall end thy glorious date the gods have spoke it and their voice is fate on either hand the squadrons part the expecting trojans stand great agamemnon bids the greeks forbear
they breathe and hush the tumult of the war the athenian maid and glorious god of day with silent joy the settling hosts survey
in form of vultures on the beech height they sit conceal and wait the future fight the thronging troops obscure the dusky fields horrid with bristling spears and gleaming shields
the waves scarce heave the face of ocean sleeps and a still horror saddens all the deeps thus in thick orders settling wide around at length composed they sit and shade the ground
great stern_hector first amidst both armies broke the solemn silence and their powers bespoke hear all ye trojan all ye grecian bands what my soul prompts and what some god commands
great which_jove averse our warfare to compose erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes war with a fiercer tide once more returns till ilion falls or till yon navy burns
you then princes of the greeks appear tis stern_hector speaks and calls the gods to hear from all your troops select the boldest knight
as when a general darkness veils the main soft zephyr curling the wide wat ry plain and him the boldest stern_hector dares to fight
here if i fall by chance of battle slain be his my spoil and his these arms remain but let my body to my friends return
and if apollo in whose aid i trust shall stretch your daring champion in the dust if mine the glory to despoil the foe on phoebus temple i ll his arms bestow
the breathless carcase to your navy sent greece on the shore shall raise a monument which when some future mariner surveys wash by broad hellespont resounding sea thus shall he say a valiant greek lies there
by trojan hands and trojan flames be burn by stern_hector slain the mighty man of war the stone shall tell your vanquish hero name
and distant ages learn the victor fame this fierce defiance greece astonish heard blush to refuse and to accept it fear
whose coward souls your manly form disgrace how great the shame when every age shall know that not a grecian met this noble foe
stern_hector great_menelaus first the silence broke and inly groaning thus opprobrious spoke women of greece scandal of your race go then
be what ye seem unanimated clay myself will dare the danger of the day tis man bold task the generous strife to try
resolve to earth from whence ye grew a heartless spiritless inglorious crew but in the hands of god is victory
these word scarce spoke with generous ardour press his manly limbs in azure arms he dress that day atrides a superior hand had stretch d
but all at once thy fury to compose the kings of greece an awful band arose even he their chief great agamemnon press thy daring hand and this advice address
thee breathless on the hostile strand whither great_menelaus wouldst thou run and tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun
grieved though thou art forbear the rash design great hectors arm is mightier far than thine even fierce achilles learn its force to fear and trembling met this dreadful son of war
the mightiest warrior of the achaian name though bold and burning with desire of fame content the doubtful honour might forego so great the danger and so brave the foe
sit thou secure amidst thy social band greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand he said and turn his brother vengeful mind
he stoop to reason and his rage resign no longer bent to rush on certain harms his joyful friends unbrace his azure arms
he from whose lips divine persuasion flows grave wise_nestor then in graceful act arose thus to the kings he spoke what grief what shame attend on greece and all the grecian name
how shall alas her hoary heroes mourn their son degenerate and their race a scorn what tears shall down thy silvery beard be
once with what joy the generous prince would hear of every chief who fought this glorious war participate their fame and pleased inquire
should he see our warriors trembling stand and trembling all before one hostile hand how would he lift his aged arms on high lament inglorious greece and beg to die
roll o peleus old in arms in wisdom old each name each action and each hero sire gods oh would to all the immortal powers above minerva phoebus and almighty which_jove
years might again roll back my youth renew and give this arm the spring which once it knew when fierce in war where jardan waters fall i led my troops to phea trembling wall
there ereuthalion braved us in the field proud areithous dreadful arms to wield great areithous known from shore to shore by the huge knotted iron mace he bore no lance he shook nor bent the twanging bow but broke with this the battle of the foe
and with the arcadian spears my prowess tried where celadon rolls down his rapid tide him not by manly force lycurgus slew whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew
deep in a winding way his breast assailed nor aught the warrior thundering mace avail supine he fell those arms which mars before had given the vanquish now the victor bore
furious with this he crush our levell bands and dared the trial of the strongest hands nor could the strongest hands his fury stay all saw and fear his huge tempestuous sway
but when old age had dimm lycurgus eyes to ereuthalion he consign the prize till i the youngest of the host appear and youngest met whom all our army fear
i fought the chief my arms minerva crown prone fell the giant er a length of ground what then i was were your wise_nestor now
but warriors you that youthful vigour boast the flower of greece the examples of our host sprung from such fathers who such numbers sway can you stand trembling and desert the day
his warm reproofs the listening kings inflame and nine the noblest of the grecian name up started fierce but far before the rest
not stern_hector self should want an equal foe the king of men advanced his dauntless breast then bold tydides great in arms
and merion dreadful as the god of war with these eurypylus and thoas stand and wise_nestor ulysses closed the daring band
appear and next his bulk gigantic oilean_ajax rear oileus follow idomen was there all these alike inspired with noble rage demand the fight
to whom the pylian sage lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide what chief shall combat let the gods decide
whom heaven shall choose be his the chance to raise his country fame his own immortal praise the lots produced each hero signs his own then in the general helm the fate are thrown
in whose hand is fate a worthy champion for the grecian state this task let oilean_ajax or tydides prove or he the king of kings beloved by which_jove
the people pray with lifted eyes and hands and vows like these ascend from all the bands grant thou almighty
this from the right to left the herald bears held out in order to the grecian peers each to his rival yields the mark unknown till godlike oilean_ajax finds the lot his own surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes then casts before him and with transport cries
old wise_nestor shook the casque by heaven inspired leap forth the lot of every greek desired warriors i claim the lot and arm with joy be mine the conquest of this chief of troy
now while my brightest arms my limbs invest to saturn son be all your vows address but pray in secret lest the foes should hear and deem your prayers the mean effect of fear
said i in secret no your vows declare in such a voice as fills the earth and air lives there a chief whom oilean_ajax ought to dread
oilean_ajax in all the toils of battle bred from warlike salamis i drew my birth and born to combats fear no force on earth
he said the troops with elevated eyes implore the god whose thunder rends the skies father of mankind superior lord
on lofty ida holy hill adored who in the highest heaven hast fix thy throne supreme of gods unbounded and alone
the praise and conquest of this doubtful day or if illustrious stern_hector be thy care that both may claim it and that both may share
now oilean_ajax braced his dazzling armour on sheathed in bright steel the giant warrior shone he moves to combat with majestic pace so stalks in arms the grisly god of thrace
grant thou that ajax_telamon may bear away when which_jove to punish faithless men prepares and gives whole nations to the waste of wars
thus march the chief tremendous as a god grimly he smiled earth trembled as he strode his massy javelin quivering in his hand he stood the bulwark of the grecian band
through every argive heart new transport ran all troy stood trembling at the mighty man even stern_hector paused and with new doubt oppress felt his great heart suspended in his breast twas vain to seek retreat and vain to fear himself had challenged and the foe drew near
huge was its orb with seven thick folds ercast of tough bull hides of solid brass the last the work of tychius who in hyle dwell d
and in all arts of armoury excell this oilean_ajax bore before his manly breast and threatening thus his adverse chief address
stern_hector ajax_telamon behind his ample shield as from a brazen tower erlook the field stern_hector approach my arm and singly know what strength thou hast and what the grecian foe
let him unactive on the sea beat shore indulge his wrath and aid our arms no more whole troops of heroes greece has yet to boast and sends thee one a sample of her host such as i am i come to prove thy might
achilles shuns the fight yet some there are not void of soul and not unskill in war no more be sudden and begin the fight
son of ajax_telamon thy country pride to oilean_ajax thus the trojan prince replied me as a boy or woman wouldst thou fright new to the field and trembling at the fight
to combat born and bred amidst alarms i know to shift my ground remount the car turn charge and answer every call of war to right to left the dexterous lance i wield and bear thick battle on my sounding shield
thou meet st a chief deserving of thy arms but open be our fight and bold each blow i steal no conquest from a noble foe
he said and rising high above the field whirl the long lance against the sevenfold shield full on the brass descending from above through six bull hides the furious weapon drove
then oilean_ajax threw through stern_hector shield the forceful javelin flew his corslet enters and his garment rends and glancing downwards near his flank descends
till in the seventh it fix the wary trojan shrinks and bending low beneath his buckler disappoints the blow from their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew then close impetuous and the charge renew
at oilean_ajax stern_hector his long lance extends the blunted point against the buckler bends but oilean_ajax watchful as his foe drew near drove through the trojan targe the knotty spear
fierce as the mountain lions bathed in blood or foaming boars the terror of the wood it reach his neck with matchless strength impell
yet ceased not stern_hector thus but stooping down in his strong hand up heaved a flinty stone black craggy vast to this his force he bends full on the brazen boss the stone descends the hollow brass resounded with the shock then oilean_ajax seized the fragment of a rock applied each nerve and swinging round on high
with force tempestuous let the ruin fly the huge stone thundering through his buckler broke his slacken knees received the numbing stroke great stern_hector falls extended on the field his bulk supporting on the shatter shield nor wanted heavenly aid
spouts the black gore and dims his shining shield apollo might confirm his sinews and restored to fight and now both heroes their broad falchions drew
in flaming circle round their heads they flew but then by heralds voice the word was given the sacred ministers of earth and heaven divine talthybius whom the greeks employ
and sage idaeus on the part of troy between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear and first idaeus awful voice was heard illustration stern_hector and oilean_ajax separated by the heralds
stern_hector and oilean_ajax separated by the heralds forbear my son your further force to prove both dear to men and both beloved of which_jove
to either host your matchless worth is known each sounds your praise and war is all your own but now the night extends her awful shade the goddess parts you be the night obey
let him who first provoked our chiefs to fight let him demand the sanction of the night if first he ask it
to whom great oilean_ajax his high soul express o sage to stern_hector be these word address i content obey and cease the strife when stern_hector shows the way
first of greeks his noble foe rejoin whom heaven adorns superior to thy kind with strength of body and with worth of mind
now martial law commands us to forbear hereafter we shall meet in glorious war some future day shall lengthen out the strife and let the gods decide of death or life
return brave oilean_ajax to thy grecian friends and joy the nations whom thy arm defends as i shall glad each chief and trojan wife who wearies heaven with vows for stern_hector life
but let us on this memorable day exchange some gift that greece and troy may say not hate but glory made these chiefs contend and each brave foe was in his soul a friend
since then the night extends her gloomy shade and heaven enjoins it be the night obey with that a sword with stars of silver graced the baldric studded and the sheath enchased he gave the greek
the generous greek bestow a radiant belt that rich with purple glow then with majestic grace they quit the plain this seeks the grecian that the phrygian train
the trojan bands returning stern_hector wait and hail with joy the champion of their state escaped great oilean_ajax they survey him round alive unarm and vigorous from his wound to troy high gates the godlike man they bear their present triumph as their late despair
but oilean_ajax glorying in his hardy deed the well arm greeks to agamemnon lead a steer for sacrifice the king design of full five years and of the nobler kind
the victim falls they strip the smoking hide the beast they quarter and the joints divide then spread the tables the repast prepare
each takes his seat and each receives his share the king himself an honorary sign before great oilean_ajax placed the mighty chine
when now the rage of hunger was removed wise_nestor in each persuasive art approved the sage whose counsels long had sway d
the rest in word like these his prudent thought express how dear kings this fatal day has cost what greeks are perish what a people lost
what tides of blood have drench scamander shore what crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more then hear me chief nor let the morrow light
awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight some space at least permit the war to breathe while we to flames our slaughter friends bequeath from the red field their scatter bodies bear and nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear so decent urns their snowy bones may keep and pious children er their ashes weep
here where on one promiscuous pile they blazed high er them all a general tomb be raised next to secure our camp and naval powers raise an embattled wall with lofty towers from space to space be ample gates around
for passing chariots and a trench profound so greece to combat shall in safety go nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe
twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved the sceptred kings of greece his word approved meanwhile convened at priam palace gate
the trojan peers in nightly council sate a senate void of order as of choice their hearts were fearful and confused their voice
tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires and i but move what every god requires let sparta treasures be this hour restored and argive_helen own her ancient lord
antenor rising thus demand their ear ye trojans dardans and auxiliars hear the ties of faith the sworn alliance broke our impious battles the just gods provoke
as this advice ye practise or reject so hope success or dread the dire effect the senior spoke and sate

to whom replied the graceful husband of the spartan bride cold counsels trojan may become thy years then hear me princes of the trojan name
their treasures i ll restore but not the dame my treasures too for peace i will resign but be this bright possession ever mine
twas then the growing discord to compose slow from his seat the reverend priam rose his godlike aspect deep attention drew he paused and these pacific word ensue ye trojans dardans and auxiliar bands
now take refreshment as the hour demand guard well the walls relieve the watch of night till the new sun restores the cheerful light
next let a truce be ask that troy may burn her slaughter heroes and their bones inurn that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty which_jove decide
then shall our herald to the atrides sent before their ships proclaim my son intent the monarch spoke the warriors snatch with haste each at his post in arms a short repast
idaeus bent his way there to the son of mars in council found he raised his voice the host stood listening round
soon as the rosy morn had waked the day to the black ships ye son of atreus and ye greeks give ear
the word of troy and troy great monarch hear pleased may ye hear so heaven succeed my prayers what paris author of the war declares
the spoil and treasures he to ilion bore oh had he perish ere they touch our shore he proffers injured greece with large increase of added trojan wealth to buy the peace
but to restore the beauteous bride again this greece demand and troy requests in vain next ye chiefs we ask a truce to burn our slaughter heroes and their bones inurn
that done once more the fate of war be tried and whose the conquest mighty which_jove decide the greeks gave ear but none the silence broke at length tydides rose and rising spoke
oh take not friends defrauded of your fame their proffer wealth nor even the spartan dame let conquest make them ours fate shakes their wall and troy already totters to her fall
the admiring chiefs and all the grecian name with general shouts return him loud acclaim then thus the king of kings rejects the peace herald
in him thou hear st the voice of greece for what remains let funeral flames be fed with heroes corps i war not with the dead
go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain and gratify the manes of the slain be witness which_jove whose thunder rolls on high
he said and rear his sceptre to the sky to sacred troy where all her princes lay to wait the event the herald bent his way
he came and standing in the midst explain the peace rejected but the truce obtain straight to their several cares the trojans move some search the plains some fell the sounding grove
and now from forth the chambers of the main to shed his sacred light on earth again arose the golden chariot of the day and tipp the mountain with a purple ray
nor less the greeks descending on the shore hew the green forests and the bodies bore in mingled throngs the greek and trojan train through heaps of carnage search the mournful plain
scarce could the friend his slaughter friend explore with dust dishonour and deformed with gore the wounds they wash their pious tears they shed and laid along their cars deplored the dead
with silent haste the bodies decent on the piles were placed with melting hearts the cold remains they burn and sadly slow to sacred troy return
nor less the greeks their pious sorrows shed and decent on the pile dispose the dead the cold remains consume with equal care and slowly sadly to their fleet repair
now ere the morn had streak with reddening light the doubtful confines of the day and night about the dying flames
sage priam check their grief the greeks appear and round the pile a general tomb they rear then to secure the camp and naval powers they raised embattled walls with lofty towers
from space to space were ample gates around for passing chariots and a trench profound of large extent and deep in earth below strong piles infix stood adverse to the foe
in shining circle round their father which_jove amazed beheld the wondrous works of man then he whose trident shakes the earth began what mortals henceforth shall our power adore our fanes frequent our oracles implore if the proud grecians thus successful boast their rising bulwarks on the sea beat coast
so toil the greeks meanwhile the gods above see the long walls extending to the main no god consulted and no victim slain
their fame shall fill the world remotest end wide as the morn her golden beam extends while old laomedon divine abodes those radiant structures raised by labouring gods shall razed and lost in long oblivion sleep
thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep the almighty thunderer with a frown replies that clouds the world and blackens half the skies strong god of ocean
thou whose rage can make the solid earth eternal basis shake what cause of fear from mortal works could move the meanest subject of our realms above
where er the sun refulgent rays are cast thy power is honour and thy fame shall last but yon proud work no future age shall view no trace remain where once the glory grew
the sapp foundations by thy force shall fall and whelm beneath the waves drop the huge wall vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore
the ruin vanish and the name no more thus they in heaven while er the grecian train the rolling sun descending to the main beheld the finish work
their bulls they slew back from the tents the savoury vapour flew and now the fleet arrived from lemnos strands with bacchus blessings cheered the generous bands
of fragrant wines the rich eunaeus sent a thousant measures to the royal tent eunaeus whom hypsipyle of yore to jason shepherd of his people bore
the rest they purchased at their proper cost and well the plenteous freight supplied the host each in exchange proportion treasures gave some brass or iron some an ox or slave
but which_jove averse the signs of wrath display and shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade humbled they stood pale horror seized on all while the deep thunder shook the aerial hall
all night they feast the greek and trojan powers those on the fields and these within their towers each pour to which_jove before the bowl was

high on the throne he shines his coursers fly between the extended earth and starry sky now had the grecians snatch a short repast and buckled on their shining arms with haste
the gates unfolding pour forth all their train squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain men steeds and chariots shake the trembling ground the tumult thickens and the skies resound and now with shouts the shocking armies closed to lances lances shields to shields opposed host against host with shadowy legends drew the sounding darts in iron tempests flew victors and vanquish join promiscuous cries triumphant shouts and dying groans arise with streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed and slaughter heroes swell the dreadful tide

with equal hand in these explored the fate of greece and troy and poised the mighty weight press with its load the grecian balance lies low sunk on earth the trojan strikes the skies
then which_jove from ida top his horrors spreads the clouds burst dreadful er the grecian heads thick lightnings flash the muttering thunder rolls their strength he withers and unmans their souls

fierce as he is even he may learn to fear the thirsty fury of my flying spear thus said the chief and wise_nestor skill in war approves his counsel and ascends the car
the steeds he left their trusty servants hold eurymedon and sthenelus the bold the reverend charioteer directs the course and strains his aged arm to lash the horse
stern_hector they face unknowing how to fear fierce he drove on tydides whirl his spear the spear with erring haste mistook its way but plunged in eniopeus bosom lay
his opening hand in death forsakes the rein the steeds fly back he falls and spurns the plain great stern_hector sorrows for his servant kill

but ah what grief should haughty stern_hector boast i fled inglorious to the guarded coast before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame erwhelm me earth and hide a warrior shame
to whom gerenian wise_nestor thus replied gods can thy courage fear the phrygian pride stern_hector may vaunt but who shall heed the boast
not those who felt thy arm the dardan host nor troy yet bleeding in her heroes lost not even a phrygian dame who dreads the sword that laid in dust her loved lamented lord
he said and hasty er the gasping throng drives the swift steeds the chariot smokes along the shouts of trojans thicken in the wind the storm of hissing javelins pours behind
then with a voice that shakes the solid skies pleased stern_hector braves the warrior as he flies go mighty hero

thou whose force can make the stedfast earth from her foundations shake seest thou the greeks by fate unjust oppress nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast
that heard deep anguish stung saturnia soul she shook her throne that shook the starry pole and thus to neptune yet ćgae helice thy power obey
would all the deities of greece combine in vain the gloomy thunderer might repine sole should he sit with scarce a god to friend and see his trojans to the shades descend
and gifts unceasing on thine altars lay such be the scene from his idaean bower ungrateful prospect to the sullen power
neptune with wrath rejects the rash design what rage what madness furious queen is thine i war not with the highest
now godlike stern_hector to whose matchless might which_jove gave the glory of the destined fight squadrons on squadrons drives and fills the fields with close ranged chariots and with thicken shields
all above submit and tremble at the hand of which_jove where the deep trench in length extended lay compacted troops stand wedged in firm array a dreadful front
they shake the brands and threat with long destroying flames the hostile fleet the king of men by juno self inspired toil through the tents and all his army fired
swift as he moved he lifted in his hand his purple robe bright ensign of command high on the midmost bark the king
appear there from ulysses deck his voice was heard to oilean_ajax and achilles reach the sound whose distant ships the guarded navy bound
he cried the hollow vessels to his voice replied where now are all your glorious boasts of yore your hasty triumphs on the lemnian shore
each fearless hero dares a hundred foes while the feast lasts and while the goblet flows but who to meet one martial man is found when the fight rages and the flames surround
argives shame of human race mighty which_jove sire of the distress was ever king like me like me oppress
with power immense with justice arm in vain my glory ravish and my people slain to thee my vows were breathed from every shore
what altar smoked not with our victims gore with fat of bulls i fed the constant flame and ask destruction to the trojan name
now gracious god far humbler our demand give these at least to scape from stern_hector hand and save the relics of the grecian land
thus pray the king and heaven great father heard his vows in bitterness of soul preferr the wrath appeased by happy signs declares and gives the people to their monarch prayers
his eagle sacred bird of heaven he sent a fawn his talons truss divine portent high er the wondering hosts he soar above
who paid their vows to panomphaean which_jove then let the prey before his altar fall the greeks beheld and transport seized on all
tydides first of all the grecian force er the broad ditch impell his foaming horse pierced the deep ranks their strongest battle tore and dyed his javelin red with trojan gore
encouraged by the sign the troops revive and fierce on troy with doubled fury drive young agelaus phradmon was his sire
with flying coursers shunn his dreadful ire struck through the back the phrygian fell oppress the dart drove on and issued at his breast headlong he quits the car his arms resound his ponderous buckler thunders on the ground
forth rush a tide of greeks the passage freed the atridae first the ajaces next succeed meriones like mars in arms renown and godlike idomen now passed the mound evaemon son next issues to the foe and last young teucer with his bended bow
secure behind the telamonian shield the skilful archer wide survey the field with every shaft some hostile victim slew then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew
the conscious infant so when fear alarms retires for safety to the mother arms thus oilean_ajax guards his brother in the field
moves as he moves and turns the shining shield who first by teucer mortal arrows bled orsilochus then fell ormenus dead
the godlike lycophon next press the plain with chromius daetor ophelestes slain bold hamopaon breathless sunk to ground the bloody pile great melanippus crown
heaps fell on heaps sad trophies of his art a trojan ghost attending every dart great agamemnon views with joyful eye
thus always thus thy early worth be tried thy brave example shall retrieve our host thy country saviour and thy father boast
the ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly youth forever dear the monarch cried sprung from an alien bed thy sire to grace the vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace
now hear a monarch vow if heaven high powers give me to raze troy long defended towers whatever treasures greece for me design the next rich honorary gift be thine
some golden tripod or distinguished car with coursers dreadful in the ranks of war or some fair captive whom thy eyes approve shall recompense the warrior toils with love
proud of his boy he own the generous flame and the brave son repays his cares with fame to this the chief with praise the rest inspire nor urge a soul already fill with fire
what strength i have be now in battle tried till every shaft in phrygian blood be dyed since rallying from our wall we forced the foe still aim at stern_hector
have i bent my bow eight forky arrows from this hand have fled and eight bold heroes by their points lie dead
but sure some god denies me to destroy this fury of the field this dog of troy he said and twang the string
the weapon flies at stern_hector breast and sings along the skies he miss the mark but pierced gorgythio heart and drench in royal blood the thirsty dart
decline the head and drooping kiss the plain so sinks the youth his beauteous head depress beneath his helmet drops upon his breast
fair castianira nymph of form divine this offspring added to king priam line as full blown poppies overcharged with rain another shaft the raging archer drew that other shaft with erring fury flew from stern_hector phoebus turn the flying wound
yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground thy breast brave archeptolemus it tore and dipp its feathers in no vulgar gore
headlong he falls his sudden fall alarms the steeds that startle at his sounding arms stern_hector with grief his charioteer beheld all pale and breathless on the sanguine field
then bids cebriones direct the rein quits his bright car and issues on the plain dreadful he shouts from earth a stone he took and rush on teucer with the lifted rock
the forceful yew the shaft already to his shoulder drew the feather in his hand just wing for flight touch where the neck and hollow chest unite there where the juncture knits the channel bone the furious chief discharged the craggy stone
he fell but oilean_ajax his broad shield display and screen his brother with the mighty shade till great alaster and mecistheus bore the batter archer groaning to the shore
the youth already strain the bow string burst beneath the ponderous blow and his numb hand dismiss his useless bow troy yet found grace before the olympian sire
he arm their hands and fill their breasts with fire the greeks repulsed retreat behind their wall or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall
first of the foe great stern_hector march along with terror clothed and more than mortal strong as the bold hound that gives the lion chase with beating bosom and with eager pace
hangs on his haunch or fastens on his heels guards as he turns and circle as he wheels thus oft the grecians turn but still they flew
thus following stern_hector still the hindmost slew when flying they had pass the trench profound and many a chief lay gasping on the ground
before the ships a desperate stand they made and fired the troops and called the gods to aid fierce on his rattling chariot stern_hector came his eyes like gorgon shot a sanguine flame
that wither all their host like mars he stood dire as the monster dreadful as the god their strong distress the wife of which_jove survey
then pensive thus to war triumphant maid daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the sable shield
now in this moment of her last despair shall wretched greece no more confess our care condemn to suffer the full force of fate and drain the dregs of heaven relentless hate
gods shall one raging hand thus level all what numbers fell what numbers yet shall fall what power divine shall stern_hector wrath assuage
so spake the imperial regent of the skies to whom the goddess with the azure eyes long since had stern_hector stain these fields with gore stretch by some argive on his native shore but he above the sire of heaven withstands mocks our attempts and slights our just demand the stubborn god inflexible and hard forgets my service and deserved reward
still swells the slaughter and still grows the rage saved i for this his favourite son distress by stern_hector eurystheus with long labours press
oh had my wisdom known this dire event when to grim pluto gloomy gates he went the triple dog had never felt his chain
he begg with tears he begg in deep dismay i shot from heaven and gave his arm the day nor styx been cross nor hell explored in vain
averse to me of all his heaven of gods at thetis suit the partial thunderer nods to grace her gloomy fierce resenting son my hopes are frustrate and my greeks undone
some future day perhaps he may be moved to call his blue eyed maid his best beloved haste launch thy chariot through yon ranks to ride myself will arm and thunder at thy side
then goddess say shall stern_hector glory then that terror of the greeks that man of men when juno self and pallas shall appear all dreadful in the crimson walks of war
what mighty trojan then on yonder shore expiring pale and terrible no more shall feast the fowls and glut the dogs with gore
she ceased and juno rein the steeds with care heaven awful empress saturn other heir pallas meanwhile her various veil unbound with flowers adorn with art immortal
crown the radiant robe her sacred fingers wove floats in rich waves and spreads the court of which_jove her father arms her mighty limbs invest
his cuirass blazes on her ample breast the vigorous power the trembling car ascends shook by her arm the massy javelin bends
huge ponderous strong that when her fury burns proud tyrants humbles and whole hosts erturns saturnia lends the lash the coursers fly smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky
they stand the sun bright portals and the skies command close or unfold the eternal gates of day bar heaven with clouds or roll those clouds away
heaven gates spontaneous open to the powers heaven golden gates kept by the winged hours commission in alternate watch the sounding hinges ring the clouds divide
prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide but which_jove incensed from ida top survey and thus enjoin the many colour maid
illustration juno and minerva going to assist the greeks juno and minerva going to assist the greeks thaumantia mount the winds and stop their car against the highest who shall wage the war
if furious yet they dare the vain debate thus have i spoke and what i speak is fate their coursers crush beneath the wheels shall lie
my lightning these rebellious shall confound and hurl them flaming headlong to the ground condemn for ten revolving years to weep the wounds
their car in fragments scatter o er the sky impress by burning thunder deep so shall minerva learn to fear our ire nor dare to combat hers and nature sire
swift as the wind the various colour maid from ida top her golden wings display to great olympus shining gate she flies there meets the chariot rushing down the skies restrains their progress from the bright abodes and speaks the mandate of the sire of gods
for juno headstrong and imperious still she claims some title to transgress our will what frenzy goddesses what rage can move celestial minds to tempt the wrath of which_jove
his lightning your rebellion shall confound and hurl ye headlong flaming to the ground your horses crush beneath the wheels shall lie your car in fragments
desist obedient to his high command this is his word and know his word shall stand scatter o er the sky yourselves condemn ten rolling years to weep the wounds impress d
by burning thunder deep so shall minerva learn to fear his ire nor dare to combat hers and nature sire for juno headstrong and imperious still she claims some title to transgress his will
then mounting on the pinions of the wind she flew and juno thus her rage resign o daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
no more let being of superior birth contend with which_jove for this low race of earth triumphant now now miserably slain they breathe or perish as the fate ordain
but thee what desperate insolence has driven to lift thy lance against the king of heaven but which_jove high counsels full effect shall find
and ever constant ever rule mankind she spoke and backward turn her steeds of light adorn with manes of gold and heavenly bright
there tied they rest in high celestial stalls the chariot propp against the crystal walls the pensive goddesses abash controll mix with the gods and fill their seats of gold
the hours unloosed them panting as they stood and heap their mangers with ambrosial food illustration the hours taking the horses from juno car
the hours taking the horses from juno car and now the thunderer meditates his flight from ida summits to the olympian height
swifter than thought the wheels instinctive fly flame through the vast of air and reach the sky twas neptune charge his coursers to unbrace and fix the car on its immortal base
there stood the chariot beaming forth its rays till with a snowy veil he screen the blaze he whose all conscious eyes the world behold the eternal thunderer sat enthroned in gold
high heaven the footstool of his feet he makes and wide beneath him all olympus shakes trembling afar the offending powers appear confused and silent for his frown they fear
he saw their soul and thus his word imparts pallas and juno say why heave your hearts soon was your battle er proud troy retired before your face and in your wrath expired
but know whoe er almighty power withstand unmatch our force unconquer is our hand who shall the sovereign of the skies control
not all the gods that crown the starry pole your hearts shall tremble if our arms we take and each immortal nerve with horror shake
for thus i speak and what i speak shall stand what power soe er provokes our lifted hand on this our hill no more shall hold his place cut off and exiled from the ethereal race
juno and pallas grieving hear the doom but feast their souls on ilion woes to come though secret anger swell d
minerva breast the prudent goddess yet her wrath repress but juno impotent of rage replies what hast thou said tyrant of the skies
strength and omnipotence invest thy throne tis thine to punish ours to grieve alone for greece we grieve abandon by her fate to drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate
from fields forbidden we submiss refrain with arms unaiding see our argives slain yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move lest all should perish in the rage of which_jove
the goddess thus and thus the god replies who swells the clouds and blackens all the skies the morning sun awaked by loud alarms shall see the almighty thunderer in arms
nor shall great stern_hector cease the rage of fight the navy flaming and thy greeks in flight even till the day when certain fate ordain that stern_hector achilles his patroclus slain
what heaps of argives then shall load the plain those radiant eyes shall view and view in vain shall rise in vengeance and lay waste the plain
for such is fate nor canst thou turn its course with all thy rage with all thy rebel force fly if thy wilt to earth remotest bound where on her utmost verge the sea resound
where cursed iapetus and saturn dwell fast by the brink within the streams of hell no sun er gilds the gloomy horrors there no cheerful gales refresh the lazy air
now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light and drew behind the cloudy veil of night the conquering trojans mourn his beams decay d
there arm once more the bold titanian band and arm in vain for what i will shall stand the greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade
the victors keep the field and stern_hector calls a martial council near the navy walls these to scamander bank apart he led where thinly
a massy spear he bore of mighty strength of full ten cubits was the lance length the point was brass refulgent to behold fix to the wood with circling rings of gold the noble stern_hector on his lance reclined and bending forward thus reveal his mind
scatter lay the heaps of dead the assembled chiefs descending on the ground attend his order and their prince surround ye valiant trojans with attention hear
ye dardan bands and generous aids give ear this day we hoped would wrap in conquering flame greece with her ships and crown our toils with fame
but darkness now to save the cowards falls and guards them trembling in their wooden walls obey the night and use her peaceful hours
straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought and strengthening bread and generous wine be brought wide er the field high blazing to the sky
let numerous fires the absent sun supply the flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise till the bright morn her purple beam displays lest in the silence and the shades of night greece on her sable ships attempt her flight
not unmolested let the wretches gain their lofty decks or safely cleave the main some hostile wound let every dart bestow some lasting token of the phrygian foe wounds that long hence may ask their spouses care
our steeds to forage and refresh our powers and warn their children from a trojan war now through the circuit of our ilion wall let sacred heralds sound the solemn call to bid the sires with
firm be the guard while distant lie our powers and let the matrons hang with lights the towers lest under covert of the midnight shade the insidious foe the naked town invade
hoary honours crown and beardless youths our battlements surround suffice to night these orders to obey a nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day
the gods i trust shall give to stern_hector hand from these detested foes to free the land who plough with fate averse
our common safety must be now the care but soon as morning paints the fields of air sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage and the fired fleet behold the battle rage
the watery way for trojan vultures a predestined prey then then shall stern_hector and tydides prove whose fate are heaviest in the scales of which_jove
shall see his bloody spoil in triumph borne with this keen javelin shall his breast be gored and prostrate heroes bleed around their lord
certain as this oh might my days endure from age inglorious and black death secure so might my life and glory know no bound like pallas worshipp like the sun renown
to morrow light haste the glorious morn as the next dawn the last they shall enjoy shall crush the greeks and end the woes of troy
the leader spoke from all his host around shouts of applause along the shores resound each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied and fix their headstalls to his chariot side
fat sheep and oxen from the town are led with generous wine and all sustaining bread full hecatombs lay burning on the shore
the winds to heaven the curling vapours bore ungrateful offering to the immortal powers whose wrath hung heavy er the trojan towers
nor priam nor his son obtain their grace proud troy they hated and her guilty race the troops exulting sat in order round and beaming fires illumined all the ground
o er heaven pure azure spreads her sacred light when not a breath disturbs the deep serene and not a cloud ercasts the solemn scene around her throne the vivid planets roll
unnumber gild the glowing pole er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed and tip with silver every mountain head then shine the vales the rocks in prospect rise a flood of glory bursts from all the skies the conscious swains rejoicing in the sight eye the blue vault and bless the useful light
as when the moon refulgent lamp of night and stars so many flames before proud ilion blaze and lighten glimmering xanthus with their rays
the long reflections of the distant fires gleam on the walls and tremble on the spires a thousand piles the dusky horrors gild and shoot a shady lustre er the field
full fifty guards each flaming pile attend whose umber arms by fits thick flashes send loud neigh the coursers er their heaps of corn and ardent warriors wait the rising morn
illustration the shield of achilles the shield of achilles book ix argument the embassy to achilles agamemnon after the last day defeat proposes to the greeks to quit the siege and return to their country
he orders the guard to be strengthened and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are to be followed in this emergency
agamemnon pursues this advice and wise_nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to achilles in order to move him to a reconciliation
diomed opposes this and wise_nestor seconds him praising his wisdom and resolution ulysses and oilean_ajax are made choice of who are accompanied by old phoenix
they make each of them very moving and pressing speeches but are rejected with roughness by achilles who notwithstanding retains phoenix in his tent
this book and the next following take up the space of one night which is the twenty seventh from the beginning of the poem
the ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp and the troops betake themselves to sleep the scene lies on the sea shore the station of the grecian ships
thus joyful troy maintain the watch of night while fear pale comrade of inglorious flight and heaven bred horror on the grecian part sat on each face and sadden every heart
as from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth a double tempest of the west and north swells er the sea from thracia frozen shore heaps waves on waves and bids the ćgean roar
this way and that the boiling deeps are toss such various passions urged the troubled host great agamemnon grieved above the rest
himself his orders to the heralds bears to bid to council all the grecian peers but bid in whispers these surround their chief in solemn sadness and majestic grief
superior sorrows swell his royal breast the king amidst the mournful circle rose down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows
with more than vulgar grief he stood oppress word mix with sighs thus bursting from his breast ye son of greece
so silent fountains from a rock tall head in sable streams soft trickling waters shed partake your leader care fellows in arms and princes of the war
of partial which_jove too justly we complain and heavenly oracles believed in vain a safe return was promised to our toils with conquest honour and
enrich with spoil now shameful flight alone can save the host our wealth our people and our glory lost so which_jove decrees almighty lord of all
which_jove at whose nod whole empires rise or fall who shakes the feeble props of human trust and towers and armies humbles to the dust
haste then for ever quit these fatal fields haste to the joys our native country yields spread all your canvas all your oars employ nor hope the fall of heaven defended troy
till tydeus warlike son roll on the king his eyes and thus begun when kings advise us to renounce our fame first let him speak who first has suffer shame
he said deep silence held the grecian band silent unmov in dire dismay they stand a pensive scene if i oppose thee prince
thy wrath withhold the laws of council bid my tongue be bold thou first and thou alone in fields of fight durst brand my courage and defame my might
nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear the greeks stood witness all our army heard the gods chief from whom our honours spring the gods have made thee but
by halves a king they gave thee sceptres and a wide command they gave dominion er the sea and land
the noblest power that might the world control they gave thee not a brave and virtuous soul is this a general voice that would suggest fears like his own to every grecian breast
from the embattled plain ships thou hast store and nearest to the main a noble care the grecians shall employ to combat conquer and extirpate troy
here greece shall stay or if all greece retire myself shall stay till troy or i expire myself and sthenelus will fight for fame god bade us fight and twas with god we came
confiding in our want of worth he stands and if we fly tis what our king commands go thou inglorious
rear he spoke the host in still attention heard truly great in whom the gods have join such strength of body with such force of mind in conduct as in courage you excel still first to act what you advise so well
he ceased the greeks loud acclamations raise and voice to voice resounds tydides praise wise_nestor then his reverend figure these wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves applauding greece with common voice approves
kings thou canst blame a bold but prudent youth and blame even kings with praise because with truth and yet those years that since thy birth have run would hardly style thee wise_nestor youngest son
unfinish in that generous mind age bids me speak nor shall the advice i bring distaste the people or offend the king cursed is the man and void of law and right unworthy property unworthy light unfit for public rule or private care
then let me add what yet remains behind a thought that wretch that monster who delights in war whose lust is murder and whose horrid joy to tear his country and his kind destroy
this night refresh and fortify thy train between the trench and wall let guards remain be that the duty of the young and bold
but thou king to council call the old great is thy sway and weighty are thy cares thy high commands must spirit all our wars
with thracian wines recruit thy honour guests for happy counsels flow from sober feasts wise_nestor weighty counsels aid a state distress and such a monarch as can choose the best
see what a blaze from hostile tents aspires how near our fleet approach the trojan fires who can unmoved behold the dreadful light
what eye beholds them and can close to night this dreadful interval determines all to morrow troy must flame or greece must fall
thus spoke the hoary sage the rest obey swift through the gates the guards direct their way his son was first to pass the lofty mound the generous thrasymed in arms renown
next him ascalaphus ialmen stood the double offspring of the warrior god deipyrus aphareus merion join and lycomed of creon noble line
seven were the leaders of the nightly bands and each bold chief a hundred spears commands the fires they light to short repasts they fall some line the trench and others man the wall
the king of men on public counsels bent convened the princes in his ample tent each seized a portion of the kingly feast but stay his hand when thirst and hunger ceased
whose superior sway assembled states and lords of earth obey the laws and sceptres to thy hand are given and millions own the care of thee and heaven
then wise_nestor spoke for wisdom long approved and slowly rising thus the council moved monarch of nations king the counsels of my age attend with thee my cares begin with thee must end
it fits alike to speak and hear pronounce with judgment with regard give ear to see no wholesome motion be withstood and ratify the best for public good
thee prince nor though a meaner give advice repine but follow it and make the wisdom thine hear then a thought not now conceived in haste
when from pelides tent you forced the maid i first opposed and faithful durst dissuade but bold of soul when headlong fury fired you wronged the man by men and gods
at once my present judgment and my past admired now seek some means his fatal wrath to end with prayers to move him or with gifts to bend
to whom the king with justice hast thou shown a prince faults and i with reason own that happy man whom which_jove still honours most is more than armies and himself a host
bless in his love this wondrous hero stands heaven fights his war and humbles all our bands fain would my heart which err through frantic rage the wrathful chief and angry gods assuage
if gifts immense his mighty soul can bow hear all ye greeks and witness what i vow ten weighty talents of the purest gold and twice ten vases of refulgent mould
yet knows no office nor has felt the flame twelve steeds unmatch in fleetness and in force and still victorious in the dusty course rich were the man whose ample stores exceed the prizes purchased by their winged speed seven lovely captives of the lesbian line skill in each art unmatch in form divine the same i chose for more than vulgar charms when lesbos sank beneath the hero arms all these to buy his friendship shall be paid and join with these the long contested maid with all her charms briseis i resign and solemn swear those charms were never mine
seven sacred tripods whose unsullied frame untouch she stay uninjured she removes pure from my arms and guiltless of my loves
these instant shall be his and if the powers give to our arms proud ilion hostile towers then shall he store when greece the spoil divides
with gold and brass his loaded navy sides besides full twenty nymphs of trojan race with copious love shall crown his warm embrace such as himself will choose who yield to none or yield to argive_helen heavenly charms alone
yet hear me further when our wars are er if safe we land on argos fruitful shore there shall he live my son our honours share and with orestes self divide my care
yet more three daughters in my court are bred and each well worthy of a royal bed laodice and iphigenia fair and bright chrysothemis with golden hair
her let him choose whom most his eyes approve i ask no presents no reward for love myself will give the dower so vast a store
seven ample cities shall confess his sway him enope and pherae him obey cardamyle with ample turrets crown and sacred pedasus for vines renown ćpea fair the pastures hira yields and rich antheia with her flowery fields
the whole extent to pylos sandy plain along the verdant margin of the main there heifers graze and labouring oxen toil
bold are the men and generous is the soil there shall he reign with power and justice crown and rule the tributary realms around
as never father gave a child before all this i give his vengeance to control and sure all this may move his mighty soul
who feels no mercy and who hears no prayers lives dark and dreadful in deep hell abodes and mortals hate him as the worst of gods great though he be it fits him to obey since more than his my years and more my sway
pluto the grisly god who never spares illustration pluto pluto the monarch thus the reverend wise_nestor then great agamemnon glorious king of men
such are thy offers as a prince may take and such as fits a generous king to make let chosen delegates this hour be sent myself will name them to pelides tent
let phoenix lead revered for hoary age great oilean_ajax next and ithacus the sage yet more to sanctify the word you send let hodius and eurybates attend
now pray to which_jove to grant what greece demand pray in deep silence and with purest hands illustration the embassy to achilles
the embassy to achilles he said and all approved the heralds bring the cleansing water from the living spring the youth with wine the sacred goblets crown and large libations drench the sands around
then from the royal tent they take their way wise_nestor turns on each his careful eye forbids to offend instructs them to apply much he advised them all
the rite perform the chiefs their thirst allay ulysses most to deprecate the chief and save the host through the still night they march and hear the roar of murmuring billows on the sounding shore
to neptune ruler of the sea profound whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround they pour forth vows their embassy to bless and calm the rage of stern_hector ćacides
the myrmidonian tents and vessels lay amused at ease the godlike man they found pleased with the solemn harp harmonious sound
and now arrived where on the sandy bay the well wrought harp from conquered thebae came of polish silver was its costly frame
with this he soothes his angry soul and sings the immortal deeds of heroes and of kings patroclus only of the royal train placed in his tent attends the lofty strain
full opposite he sat and listen long in silence waiting till he ceased the song unseen the grecian embassy proceeds to his high tent the great ulysses leads
achilles starting as the chiefs he spied leap from his seat and laid the harp aside with like surprise arose menoetius son pelides grasp their hands and thus begun
princes all hail whatever brought you here or strong necessity or urgent fear welcome though greeks for not as foes ye came to me more dear than all that bear the name
with that the chiefs beneath his roof he led and placed in seats with purple carpets spread then thus patroclus crown a larger bowl mix purer wine and open every soul
of all the warriors yonder host can send thy friend most honours these and these thy friend he said patroclus er the blazing fire heaps in a brazen vase
three chines entire the brazen vase automedon sustains which flesh of porker sheep and goat contains achilles at the genial feast presides the parts transfixes and with skill divides
then when the languid flames at length subside he strows a bed of glowing embers wide above the coals the smoking fragments turns and sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns with bread the glittering canisters they load which round the board menoetius son bestow himself opposed to ulysses full in sight each portion parts and orders every rite
the first fat offering to the immortals due amidst the greedy flames patroclus threw then each indulging in the social feast his thirst and hunger soberly repress that done to phoenix oilean_ajax gave the sign not unperceived ulysses crown with wine the foaming bowl and instant thus began his speech addressing to the godlike man
meanwhile patroclus sweats the fire to raise the tent is brighten with the rising blaze health to achilles happy are thy guests
not those more honour whom atrides feasts though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards that agamemnon regal tent affords but greater cares sit heavy on our souls nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls
the dead we mourn and for the living fear greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands and owns no help
troy and her aids for ready vengeance call their threatening tents already shade our wall hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim and point at every ship their vengeful flame
what scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear but from thy saving hands for them the father of the gods declares theirs are his omens and his thunder theirs
see full of which_jove avenging stern_hector rise see heaven and earth the raging chief defies what fury in his breast what lightning in his eyes
he waits but for the morn to sink in flame the ships the greeks and all the grecian name heavens how my country woes distract my mind lest fate accomplish all his rage design
oh return though late to save thy greeks and stop the course of fate if in that heart or grief or courage lies rise to redeem ah yet to conquer rise
and must we gods our heads inglorious lay in trojan dust and this the fatal day return achilles the day may come when all our warriors slain that heart shall melt that courage rise in vain
when peleus in his aged arms embraced his parting son these accents were his last my child with strength with glory and success thy arms may juno and minerva bless
regard in time prince divinely brave those wholesome counsels which thy father gave trust that to heaven but thou thy cares engage to calm thy passions and subdue thy rage
from gentler manners let thy glory grow and shun contention the sure source of woe that young and old may in thy praise combine the virtues of humanity be thine this now despised advice thy father gave ah check thy anger and be truly brave
if thou wilt yield to great atrides prayers gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares if not but hear me while i number er
the proffer presents an exhaustless store ten weighty talents of the purest gold and twice ten vases of refulgent mould seven sacred tripods whose unsullied frame
twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force and still victorious in the dusty course rich were the man whose ample stores exceed the prizes purchased by their winged speed seven lovely captives of the lesbian line skill in each art unmatch d
yet knows no office nor has felt the flame in form divine the same he chose for more than vulgar charms when lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms
all these to buy thy friendship shall be paid and join with these the long contested maid with all her charms briseis he ll resign and solemn swear those charms were only thine
untouch she stay uninjured she removes pure from his arms and guiltless of his loves these instant shall be thine and
if the powers give to our arms proud ilion hostile towers then shalt thou store when greece the spoil divides with gold and brass thy loaded navy sides
besides full twenty nymphs of trojan race with copious love shall crown thy warm embrace such as thyself shall chose who yield to none or yield to argive_helen heavenly charms alone
yet hear me further when our wars are er if safe we land on argos fruitful shore there shalt thou live his son his honour share
and with orestes self divide his care yet more three daughters in his court are bred and each well worthy of a royal bed
whom most thy eyes approve he asks no presents no reward for love himself will give the dower so vast a store
laodice and iphigenia fair and bright chrysothemis with golden hair her shalt thou wed as never father gave a child before
seven ample cities shall confess thy sway the enope and pherae thee obey cardamyle with ample turrets crown and sacred pedasus for vines renown
ćpea fair the pastures hira yields and rich antheia with her flowery fields the whole extent to pylos sandy plain along the verdant margin of the main
there heifers graze and labouring oxen toil bold are the men and generous is the soil there shalt thou reign with power and justice crown and rule the tributary realms around
but if all this relentless thou disdain if honour and if interest plead in vain yet some redress to suppliant greece afford and be amongst her guardian gods adored
such are the proffers which this day we bring such the repentance of a suppliant king if no regard thy suffering country claim hear thy own glory and the voice of fame
for now that chief whose unresisted ire made nations tremble and whole hosts retire proud stern_hector now the unequal fight demand and only triumphs to deserve thy hands
then thus the goddess born ulysses hear a faithful speech that knows nor art nor fear what in my secret soul is understood my tongue shall utter and my deeds make good
let greece then know my purpose i retain nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain who dares think one thing and another tell my heart detests him as the gates of hell
then thus in short my fix resolves attend which nor atrides nor his greeks can bend long toils long perils in their cause i bore
but now the unfruitful glories charm no more fight or not fight a like reward we claim the wretch and hero find their prize the same
alike regretted in the dust he lies who yields ignobly or who bravely dies of all my dangers all my glorious pains a life of labours lo
as the bold bird her helpless young attends from danger guards them and from want defends in search of prey she wings the spacious air
for thankless greece such hardships have i braved her wife her infant by my labours saved long sleepless nights in heavy arms i stood and sweat laborious days in dust and blood
and twelve lay smoking on the trojan plain then at atrides haughty feet were laid the wealth i gathered and the spoil i made
what fruit remains and with the untasted food supplies her care i sack twelve ample cities on the main your mighty monarch these in peace possess some few my soldiers had himself the rest
some present too to every prince was paid and every prince enjoys the gift he made i only must refund of all his train see what pre eminence our merits gain
his greedy soul delights my spouse alone must bless his lustful nights the woman let him as he may enjoy but what the quarrel then of greece to troy
my spoil alone what to these shores the assembled nations draws what calls for vengeance but a woman cause are fair endowments and a beauteous face
beloved by none but those of atreus race the wife whom choice and passion doth approve sure every wise_nestor and worthy man will love
nor did my fair one less distinction claim slave as she was my soul adored the dame wrong in my love all proffers i disdain deceived for once i trust not kings again
ye have my answer what remains to do your king ulysses may consult with you what needs he the defence this arm can make
has he not walls no human force can shake has he not fenced his guarded navy round with piles with ramparts and a trench profound
and will not these the wonders he has done repel the rage of priam single son there was a time twas when for greece i fought
when stern_hector prowess no such wonders wrought he kept the verge of troy nor dared to wait achilles fury at the scaean gate he tried it once and scarce was saved by fate
but now those ancient enmities are er to morrow we the favouring gods implore then shall you see our parting vessels crown and hear with oars the hellespont resound
the third day hence shall pthia greet our sails if mighty neptune send propitious gales pthia to her achilles shall restore the wealth he left for this detested shore
the ruddy gold the steel and shining brass my beauteous captives thither i ll convey and all that rests of my unravish prey
thither the spoil of this long war shall pass one only valued gift your tyrant gave and that resumed the fair lyrnessian slave
then tell him loud that all the greeks may hear and learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear for arm in impudence mankind he braves and meditates new cheats on all his slave though shameless as he is to face these eyes is what he dares not if he dares he dies tell him all terms all commerce i decline nor share his council nor his battle join for once deceiv was his but twice were mine
his gifts are hateful kings of such a kind stand but as slave before a noble mind not though he proffer all himself
possess and all his rapine could from others wrest not all the golden tides of wealth that crown the many peopled orchomenian town
thebes unrivall walls contain the world great empress on the egyptian plain that spreads her conquests er a thousand states and pours her heroes through a hundred gates two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars from each wide portal issuing to the wars
though bribes were heap on bribes in number more than dust in fields or sands along the shore should all these offers for my friendship call tis he that offers and i scorn them all
atrides daughter never shall be led an ill match consort to achilles bed like golden venus though she charm the heart and vied with pallas in the works of art some greater greek let those high nuptials grace i hate alliance with a tyrant race
if heaven restore me to my realms with life the reverend peleus shall elect my wife thessalian nymphs there are of form divine and kings that sue to mix their blood with mine
bless in kind love my years shall glide away content with just hereditary sway there deaf for ever to the martial strife enjoy the dear prerogative of life
no let the stupid prince whom which_jove deprives of sense and justice run where frenzy drives not all proud life is not to be bought with heaps of gold
not all apollo pythian treasures hold or troy once held in peace and pride of sway can bribe the poor possession of a day
lost herds and treasures we by arms regain and steeds unrivall on the dusty plain but from our lips the vital spirit fled returns no more to wake the silent dead
my fate long since by thetis were disclosed and each alternate life or fame proposed here if i stay before the trojan town short is my date but deathless my renown if i return i quit immortal praise for years on years and long extended days
convinced though late i find my fond mistake and warn the greeks the wiser choice to make to quit these shores their native seats enjoy nor hope the fall of heaven defended troy
go then to greece report our fix design bid all your counsels all your armies join let all your forces all your arts conspire to save the ships the troops the chiefs from fire
which_jove arm display asserts her from the skies her hearts are strengthen and her glories rise one stratagem has fail and others will ye find achilles is unconquer still
go then digest my message as ye may but here this night let reverend phoenix stay his tedious toils and hoary hairs demand a peaceful death in pthia friendly land
but whether he remain or sail with me his age be sacred and his will be free illustration greek galley greek galley
the son of peleus ceased the chiefs around in silence wrapt in consternation drown attend the stern_hector reply then phoenix rose down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows
and while the fate of suffering greece he mourn with accent weak these tender word return illustration proserpine proserpine divine achilles
wilt thou then retire and leave our hosts in blood our fleets on fire if wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind
he sent thee early to the achaian host thy youth as then in sage debates unskill and new to perils of the direful field he bade me teach thee all the ways of war to shine in councils and in camps to dare
how shall thy friend thy phoenix stay behind the royal peleus when from pthia coast never ah never let me leave thy side
no time shall part us and no fate divide not though the god that breathed my life restore the bloom i boasted and the port i bore when greece of old beheld my youthful flames delightful greece the land of lovely dames my father faithless to my mother arms old as he was adored a stranger charms
i tried what youth could do at her desire to win the damsel and prevent my sire my sire with curses loads my hated head and cries ye furies
barren be his bed infernal which_jove the vengeful fiends below and ruthless proserpine confirm his vow despair and grief distract my labouring mind
to plunge the poniard in my father breast then meditate my flight my friends in vain with prayers entreat me and with force detain
on fat of rams black bulls and brawny swine they daily feast with draughts of fragrant wine strong guards they placed and watch nine nights entire the roofs and porches flamed with constant fire
gods what a crime my impious heart design i thought but some kind god that thought suppress the tenth i forced the gates unseen of all and
favour by the night erleap the wall my travels thence through spacious greece extend in phthia court at last my labours end
your sire received me as his son caress with gifts enrich and with possessions bless the strong dolopians thenceforth own my reign and all the coast that runs along the main
by love to thee his bounties i repaid and early wisdom to thy soul convey great as thou art my lessons made thee brave
a child i took thee but a hero gave thy infant breast a like affection show still in my arms an ever pleasing load
i pass my watchings er thy helpless years the tender labours the compliant cares the gods i thought reversed their hard decree and phoenix felt a father joys in thee
or at my knee by phoenix wouldst thou stand no food was grateful but from phoenix hand thy growing virtues justified my cares and promised comfort to my silver hairs
the gods the only great and only wise_nestor are moved by offerings vows and sacrifice offending man their high compassion wins and daily prayers atone for daily sins
prayers are which_jove daughters of celestial race lame are their feet and wrinkled is their face with humble mien and with dejected eyes constant they follow where injustice flies
injustice swift erect and unconfined sweeps the wide earth and tramples er mankind while prayers to heal her wrongs move slow behind
who hears these daughters of almighty which_jove for him they mediate to the throne above when man rejects the humble suit they make the sire revenges for the daughters sake
now be thy rage thy fatal rage resign a cruel heart ill suits a manly mind from which_jove commission fierce injustice then descends to punish unrelenting men
o let not headlong passion bear the sway these reconciling goddesses obey due honours to the seed of which_jove belong due honours calm the fierce and bend the strong
were these not paid thee by the terms we bring were rage still harbour in the haughty king nor greece nor all her fortune should engage thy friend to plead against so just a rage
but since what honour asks the general sends and sends by those whom most thy heart commends the best and noblest of the grecian train permit not these to sue and sue in vain
let me my son an ancient fact unfold a great example drawn from times of old hear what our fathers were and what their praise
once fought the ćtolian and curetian bands to guard it those to conquer these advance and mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance
who conquer their revenge in former days where calydon on rocky mountain stands the silver cynthia bade contention rise in vengeance of neglected sacrifice on oeneus fields she sent a monstrous boar that levell harvests and whole forests tore
this beast when many a chief his tusks had slain great meleager stretch along the plain then for his spoil a new debate arose the neighbour nations thence commencing foes
strong as they were the bold curetes fail while meleager thundering arm prevail till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast for rage invades the wisest and the best
she from marpessa sprung divinely fair and matchless idas more than man in war the god of day adored the mother charms against the god the father bent his arms the afflicted pair their sorrows to proclaim from cleopatra changed their daughter name and
cursed by althaea to his wrath he yields and in his wife embrace forgets the fields call alcyone a name to show the father grief the mourning mother woe
to her the chief retired from stern_hector debate but found no peace from fierce althaea hate althaea hate the unhappy warrior drew
whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew she beat the ground and call the powers beneath on her own son to wreak her brother death hell heard her curses from the realms profound and the red fiends that walk the nightly round
she sent ambassadors a chosen band priests of the gods and elders of the land besought the chief to save the sinking state their prayers were urgent and their proffers great
in vain ćtolia her deliverer waits war shakes her walls and thunders at her gates full fifty acres of the richest ground
his sisters follow even the vengeful dame althaea sues his friends before him fall he stands relentless and rejects them all
meanwhile the victor shouts ascend the skies the walls are scaled the rolling flames arise at length his wife a form divine appears with piercing cries and supplicating tears she paints the horrors of a conquer town the heroes slain the palaces erthrown the matrons ravish d
half pasture green and half with vineyards crown his suppliant father aged oeneus came the whole race enslaved the warrior heard he vanquish and he saved
learn hence betimes to curb pernicious ire nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire accept the presents draw thy conquering sword and be amongst our guardian gods adored
the ćtolians long disdain now took their turn and left the chief their broken faith to mourn thus he the stern_hector achilles thus replied
thy friend believe me no such gifts demand and asks no honours from a mortal hands which_jove honours me and favours my design his pleasure guides me and his will confines and here i stay if such his high behest
my second father and my reverend guide while life warm spirit beats within my breast yet hear one word and lodge it in thy heart
no more molest me on atrides part is it for him these tears are taught to flow for him these sorrows
a generous friendship no cold medium knows burns with one love with one resentment glows one should our interests and our passions be my friend must hate the man that injures me
for my mortal foe do this my phoenix tis a generous part and share my realms my honours and my heart
let these return our voyage or our stay rest undetermined till the dawning day he ceased then order for the sage bed a warmer couch with numerous carpets spread
with that stern_hector oilean_ajax his long silence broke and thus impatient to ulysses spoke hence let us go why waste we time in vain
see what effect our low submissions gain liked or not liked his word we must relate the greeks expect them and our heroes wait
proud as he is that iron heart retains its stubborn purpose and his friends disdains stern_hector and unpitying if a brother bleed on just atonement we remit the deed
a sire the slaughter of his son forgives the price of blood discharged the murderer lives the haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign and gifts can conquer every soul but thine
the gods that unrelenting breast have steel and cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield one woman slave was ravish from thy arms lo seven are offer and of equal charms
then hear achilles be of better mind revere thy roof and to thy guests be kind and know the men of all the grecian host who honour worth and prize thy valour most
soul of battles and thy people guide to oilean_ajax thus the first of greeks replied well hast thou spoke but at the tyrant name my rage rekindles and my soul on flame
the glorious combat is no more my care not till amidst yon sinking navy slain the blood of greeks shall dye the sable main not till the flames by stern_hector fury thrown consume your vessels and approach my own just there the impetuous homicide shall stand there cease his battle and there feel our hand
tis just resentment and becomes the brave disgraced dishonour like the vilest slave return then heroes and our answer bear
this said each prince a double goblet crown and cast a large libation on the ground then to their vessels through the gloomy shades the chiefs return divine ulysses leads
meantime achilles slave prepared a bed with fleeces carpets and soft linen spread there till the sacred morn restored the day
but in his inner tent an ampler space achilles slept and in his warm embrace fair diomede of the lesbian race
whose nightly joys the beauteous iphis shared achilles to his friend consign her charms when scyros fell before his conquering arms
in slumber sweet the reverend phoenix lay last for patroclus was the couch prepared and now the elected chiefs whom greece had sent pass through the hosts and reach the royal tent
then rising all with goblets in their hands the peers and leaders of the achaian bands hail their return atrides first begun say what success divine laertes son
achilles high resolves declare to all returns the chief or must our navy fall great king of nations ithacus replied fix is his wrath unconquer is his pride
he slights thy friendship thy proposals scorns and thus implored with fiercer fury burns to save our army and our fleets to free is not his care but left to greece and thee
beneath his oars the whitening billows fly us too he bids our oars and sails employ nor hope the fall of heaven protected troy
your eyes shall view when morning paints the sky for which_jove ershades her with his arm divine inspires her war and bids her glory shine
such was his word what further he declared these sacred heralds and great oilean_ajax heard but phoenix in his tent the chief retains safe to transport him to his native plains
when morning dawns if other he decree his age is sacred and his choice is free ulysses ceased the great achaian host with sorrow seized in consternation lost attend the stern_hector reply
tydides broke the general silence and undaunted spoke why should we gifts to proud achilles send or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend
his country woes he glories to deride and prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride be the fierce impulse of his rage obey
our battles let him or desert or aid then let him arm when which_jove or he think fit that to his madness or to heaven commit what for ourselves we can is always ours this night let due repast refresh our powers for strength consists in spirits and in blood
but when the rosy messenger of day strikes the blue mountain with her golden ray ranged at the ships let all our squadrons shine in flaming arms a long extended line
and those are owed to generous wine and food in the dread front let great atrides stand the first in danger as in high command
shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise then each to heaven the due libations pays till sleep descending er the tents bestows the grateful blessings of desired repose
upon the refusal of achilles to return to the army the distress of agamemnon is described in the most lively manner
he takes no rest that night but passes through the camp awaking the leaders and contriving all possible methods for the public safety
illustration achilles achilles book argument the night adventure of diomed and ulysses great_menelaus wise_nestor ulysses and diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains
they call a council of war and determine to send scouts into the enemies camp to learn their posture and discover their intentions
diomed undertakes this hazardous enterprise and makes choice of ulysses for his companion in their passage they surprise dolon whom stern_hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the grecians
from him they are informed of the situation of the trojan and auxiliary forces and particularly of rhesus and the thracians who were lately arrived
they pass on with success kill rhesus with several of his officers and seize the famous horses of that prince with which they return in triumph to the camp
all night the chiefs before their vessels lay and lost in sleep the labours of the day all but the king with various thought oppress
as when by lightnings which_jove ethereal power foretels the rattling hail or weighty shower or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore or bids the brazen throat of war to roar by fits one flash succeeds as one expires and heaven flames thick with momentary fires
the same night continues the scene lies in the two camps his country cares lay rolling in his breast so bursting frequent from atrides breast sighs following sighs his inward fears confess
now er the fields dejected he surveys from thousand trojan fires the mounting blaze hears in the passing wind their music blow and marks distinct the voices of the foe
he rends his hair in sacrifice to which_jove and sues to him that ever lives above inly he groans while glory and despair divide his heart and wage a double war
a thousand cares his labouring breast revolves to seek sage wise_nestor now the chief resolves with him in wholesome counsels to debate what yet remains to save the afflicted state
he rose and first he cast his mantle round next on his feet the shining sandals bound a lion yellow spoil
now looking backwards to the fleet and coast anxious he sorrows for the endangered host his back conceal his warlike hand a pointed javelin held
alike denied the gifts of soft repose laments for greece that in his cause before so much had suffer and must suffer more
a brazen helmet glitter on his head thus with a javelin in his hand he went to wake atrides in the royal tent
meanwhile his brother press with equal woes a leopard spotted hide his shoulders spread already waked atrides he descried his armour buckling at his vessel side
joyful they met the spartan thus begun why puts my brother his bright armour on sends he some spy amidst these silent hours to try yon camp and watch the trojan powers
but say what hero shall sustain that task such bold exploits uncommon courage ask guideless alone through night dark shade to go and midst a hostile camp explore the foe
to whom the king in such distress we stand no vulgar counsel our affairs demand greece to preserve is now no easy part but asks high wisdom deep design and art
witness or what ear believed in one great day by one great arm achieved such wondrous deeds as stern_hector hand has done and we beheld the last revolving sun
for which_jove averse our humble prayer denies and bows his head to stern_hector sacrifice what eye has what honours the beloved of which_jove adorn
sprung from no god and of no goddess born yet such his acts as greeks unborn shall tell and curse the battle where their fathers fell
now speed thy hasty course along the fleet there call great oilean_ajax and the prince of crete ourself to hoary wise_nestor will repair to keep the guards on duty be his care for wise_nestor influence best that quarter guides whose son with merion
er the watch presides to whom the spartan these thy orders borne say shall i stay or with despatch return
there shall thou stay the king of men replied else may we miss to meet without a guide the paths so many and the camp so wide
still with your voice the slothful soldiers raise urge by their fathers fame their future praise forget we now our state and lofty birth not titles here but works must prove our worth
to labour is the lot of man below and when which_jove gave us life he gave us woe this said each parted to his several cares
the king to wise_nestor sable ship repairs the sage protector of the greeks he found stretch in his bed with all his arms around the various colour scarf the shield he rears the shining helmet and the pointed spears the dreadful weapons of the warrior rage that old in arms disdain the peace of age
then leaning on his hand his watchful head the hoary monarch raised his eyes and said what art thou speak that on design unknown while others sleep thus range the camp alone
seek st thou some friend or nightly sentinel stand off approach not but thy purpose tell son of neleus thus the king rejoin
lo here the wretched agamemnon stands the unhappy general of the grecian bands whom which_jove decrees with daily cares to bend and woes that only with his life shall end
pride of the greeks and glory of thy kind scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain and scarce my heart support its load of pain
no taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known confused and sad i wander thus alone with fears distracted with no fix design and all my people miseries are mine
if aught of use thy waking thought suggest since cares like mine deprive thy soul of rest impart thy counsel and assist thy friend now let us jointly to the trench descend
tired with the toils of day and watch of night else may the sudden foe our works invade so near and favour by the gloomy shade
at every gate the fainting guard excite to him thus wise_nestor trust the powers above nor think proud stern_hector hopes confirm by which_jove
audacious stern_hector if the gods ordain that great achilles rise and rage again what toils attend thee and what woes remain
how ill agree the views of vain mankind and the wise_nestor counsels of the eternal mind lo faithful wise_nestor thy command obeys
the care is next our other chiefs to raise ulysses diomed we chiefly need meges for strength oileus famed for speed
some other be despatch of nimbler feet to those tall ships remotest of the fleet where lie great oilean_ajax and the king of crete
i myself decree dear as he is to us and dear to thee yet must i tax his sloth that claims no share with his great brother in his martial care
him it behoved to every chief to sue preventing every part perform by you for strong necessity our toils demand claims all our hearts and urges all our hands
to whom the king with reverence we allow thy just rebukes yet learn to spare them now my generous brother is of gentle kind he seems remiss but bears a valiant mind through too much deference to our sovereign sway content to follow when we lead the way but now our ills industrious to prevent long ere the rest he rose and sought my tent
the chiefs you named already at his call prepare to meet us near the navy wall assembling there between the trench and gates
to rouse the spartan near the night guards our chosen council waits then none said wise_nestor shall his rule withstand
the shining greaves his manly legs enclose his purple mantle golden buckles join warm with the softest wool and doubly lined
for great examples justify command with that the venerable warrior rose then rushing from his tent he snatch in haste his steely lance that lighten as he pass
the camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd stopp at ulysses tent and call aloud ulysses sudden as the voice was sent awakes starts up and issues from his tent
what new distress what sudden cause of fright thus leads you wandering in the silent night prudent chief
wise_nestor as thou art be now thy wisdom tried whatever means of safety can be sought whatever counsels can inspire our thought whatever methods or to fly or fight all all depend on this important night
the pylian sage replied he heard return and took his painted shield then join the chiefs and follow through the field
without his tent bold diomed they found all sheathed in arms his brave companions round each sunk in sleep extended on the field his head reclining on his bossy shield
a wood of spears stood by that fix upright shot from their flashing points a quivering light a bull black hide composed the hero bed
a splendid carpet roll beneath his head then with his foot old wise_nestor gently shakes the slumbering chief and in these word awakes rise son of tydeus
to the brave and strong rest seems inglorious and the night too long but sleep st thou now when from yon hill the foe hangs er the fleet and shades our walls below
at this soft slumber from his eyelids fled the warrior saw the hoary chief and said wondrous old man whose soul no respite knows though years and honours bid thee seek repose let younger greeks
my friend he answered generous is thy care these toils my subjects and my son might bear their loyal thought and pious love conspire to ease a sovereign and relieve a sire
but now the last despair surrounds our host no hour must pass no moment must be lost each single greek in this conclusive strife stands on the sharpest edge of death or life
yet if my years thy kind regard engage employ thy youth as i employ my age succeed to these my cares and rouse the rest he serves me most who serves his country best
this said the hero er his shoulders flung a lion spoil that to his ankles hung then seized his ponderous lance and strode along
our sleeping warriors wake ill fits thy age these toils to undertake meges the bold with oilean_ajax famed for speed the warrior roused and to the entrenchments lead
and now the chiefs approach the nightly guard a wakeful squadron each in arms prepared the unwearied watch their listening leaders keep and couching close repel invading sleep
with toil protected from the prowling train when the gaunt lioness with hunger bold springs from the mountain toward the guarded fold through breaking woods her rustling course they hear loud and more loud the clamours strike their ear of hounds and men they start they gaze around
thus watch the grecians cautious of surprise each voice each motion drew their ears and eyes each step of passing feet increased the affright and hostile troy was ever full in sight
so faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain watch every side and turn to every sound wise_nestor with joy the wakeful band survey and thus accosted through the gloomy shade
tis well my son your nightly cares employ else must our host become the scorn of troy watch thus and greece shall live
the hero said then er the trench the following chieftains led his son and godlike merion march behind for these the princes to their council join
a place there was yet undefiled with gore the spot where stern_hector stopp his rage before when night descending from his vengeful hand reprieved the relics of the grecian band
the trenches pass the assembled kings around in silent state the consistory crown the plain beside with mangled corps was spread and all his progress mark by heaps of dead
there sat the mournful kings when neleus son the council opening in these word begun is there said he a chief so greatly brave his life to hazard and his country save
lives there a man who singly dares to go to yonder camp or seize some straggling foe or favour by the night approach so near their speech their counsels and design to hear
this could he learn and to our peers recite and pass unharm the dangers of the night what fame were his through all succeeding days while phoebus shines or men have tongues to praise
if to besiege our navies they prepare or troy once more must be the seat of war what gifts his grateful country would bestow
a sable ewe each leader should provide with each a sable lambkin by her side at every rite his share should be increased and his the foremost honours of the feast
what must not greece to her deliverer owe fear held them mute alone untaught to fear tydides spoke the man you seek is here
through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way some god within commands and i obey but let some other chosen warrior join to raise my hopes and second my design
by mutual confidence and mutual aid great deeds are done and great discoveries made the wise_nestor new prudence from the wise_nestor acquire and one brave hero fans another fire
contending leaders at the word arose each generous breast with emulation glows so brave a task each oilean_ajax strove to share bold merion strove and wise_nestor valiant heir the spartan wish the second place to gain and great ulysses wish nor wish in vain
thou first of warriors and thou best of friends undaunted diomed what chief to join in this great enterprise is only thine
then thus the king of men the contest end just be thy choice without affection made to birth or office no respect be paid let worth determine here
the monarch spake and inly trembled for his brother sake then thus the godlike diomed rejoin my choice declares the impulse of my mind
a chief whose safety is minerva care so famed so dreadful in the works of war bless in his conduct i no aid require wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire
how can i doubt while great ulysses stands to lend his counsels and assist our hands it fits thee not before these chiefs of fame
replied the sage to praise me or to blame praise from a friend or censure from a foe are lost on hearers that our merits know
the reddening orient shows the coming day the stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains and of night empire but a third remains
but let us haste night rolls the hours away thus having spoke with generous ardour press in arms terrific their huge limbs
then in a leathern helm he cased his head short of its crest and with no plume erspread such as by youths unused to arms are worn
they dress a two edged falchion thrasymed the brave and ample buckler to tydides gave no spoil enrich it and no studs adorn
next him ulysses took a shining sword a bow and quiver with bright arrows stored a well proved casque with leather braces bound thy gift meriones his temples crown soft wool within without in order spread
this from amyntor rich ormenus son autolycus by fraudful rapine won and gave amphidamas from him the prize molus received the pledge of social ties the helmet next by merion was possess
a boar white teeth grinn horrid er his head and now ulysses thoughtful temples press thus sheathed in arms the council they forsake and dark through paths oblique their progress take
just then in sign she favour their intent a long wing heron great minerva sent this though surrounding shades obscured their view
ulysses pray hail the glad omen and address the maid daughter of that god whose arm can wield the avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
by the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew as from the right she soar o thou for ever present in my way who all my motions all my toils survey
safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade safe by thy succour to our ships convey and let some deed this signal night adorn to claim the tears of trojans yet unborn
then godlike diomed preferr his prayer daughter of which_jove unconquer pallas hear great queen of arms whose favour tydeus won
when on ćsopus banks the banded powers of greece he left and sought the theban towers peace was his charge received with peaceful show he went a legate but return a foe
as thou defend st the sire defend the son then help by thee and cover by thy shield he fought with numbers and made numbers yield
a youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke untamed unconscious of the galling yoke with ample forehead and with spreading horns whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns
so now be present celestial maid so still continue to the race thine aid the heroes pray and pallas from the skies
now like two lions panting for the prey with dreadful thought they trace the dreary way through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain through dust through blood er arms and hills of slain
nor less bold stern_hector and the son of troy on high design the wakeful hours employ the assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed who thus the counsels of his breast proposed what glorious man for high attempts prepared dares greatly venture for a rich reward
accords their vow succeeds their enterprise of yonder fleet a bold discovery make what watch they keep and what resolves they take
his be the chariot that shall please him most of all the plunder of the vanquish host his the fair steeds that all the rest excel and his the glory to have served so well
a youth there was among the tribes of troy dolon his name eumedes only boy five girls beside the reverend herald told
rich was the son in brass and rich in gold not bless by nature with the charms of face but swift of foot and matchless in the race
if now subdued they meditate their flight and spent with toil neglect the watch of night stern_hector he said my courage bids me meet this high achievement and explore the fleet
but first exalt thy sceptre to the skies and swear to grant me the demanded prize the immortal coursers and the glittering car that bear pelides through the ranks of war
encouraged thus no idle scout i go fulfil thy wish their whole intention know even to the royal tent pursue my way and all their counsels all their aims betray
the chief then heaved the golden sceptre high attesting thus the monarch of the sky be witness thou immortal lord of all
whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall by none but dolon shall this prize be borne and him alone the immortal steeds adorn
across his back the bended bow he flung a wolf grey hide around his shoulders hung a ferret downy fur his helmet lined
thus stern_hector swore the gods were call in vain but the rash youth prepares to scour the plain and in his hand a pointed javelin shined
then never to return he sought the shore and trod the path his feet must tread no more scarce had he pass the steeds and trojan throng still bending forward as he coursed along
i hear some step of hostile feet moving this way or hastening to the fleet some spy perhaps to lurk beside the main or nightly pillager that strips the slain
when on the hollow way the approaching tread ulysses mark and thus to diomed friend yet let him pass and win a little space then rush behind him and prevent his pace
but if too swift of foot he flies before confine his course along the fleet and shore betwixt the camp and him
with that they stepp aside and stoop their head as dolon pass behind a heap of dead along the path the spy unwary flew soft at just distance both the chiefs pursue
so distant they and such the space between as when two teams of mules divide the green to whom the hind like shares of land allows
now dolon listening heard them as they pass stern_hector he thought had sent and check his haste till scarce at distance of a javelin throw no voice succeeding he perceived the foe
as when two skilful hounds the leveret wind or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind now lost now seen they intercept his way and from the herd still turn the flying prey so fast and with such fears the trojan flew so close so constant
our spears employ and intercept his hoped return to troy when now new furrows part the approaching ploughs the bold greeks pursue
now almost on the fleet the dastard falls and mingles with the guards that watch the walls when brave tydides stopp a gen rous thought inspired by pallas in his bosom wrought
lest on the foe some forward greek advance and snatch the glory from his lifted lance then thus aloud whoe er thou art remain this javelin else shall fix thee to the plain
he said and high in air the weapon cast which wilful err and er his shoulder pass then fix in earth
against the trembling wood the wretch stood propp and quiver as he stood a sudden palsy seized his turning head his loose teeth
chatter and his colour fled the panting warriors seize him as he stands and with unmanly tears his life demand
o spare my youth and for the breath i owe large gifts of price my father shall bestow vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told and steel well temper and refulgent gold
to whom ulysses made this wise_nestor reply whoe er thou art be bold nor fear to die what moves thee say when sleep has closed the sight to roam the silent fields in dead of night
cam st thou the secrets of our camp to find by stern_hector prompted or thy daring mind or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led through heaps of carnage to despoil the dead
then thus pale dolon with a fearful look still as he spoke his limbs with horror shook hither i came by stern_hector word deceived much did he promise
those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war urged me unwilling this attempt to make to learn what counsels what resolves you take if now subdued you fix your hopes on flight
rashly i believed no less a bribe than great achilles car and and tired with toils neglect the watch of night
bold was thy aim and glorious was the prize ulysses with a scornful smile replies far other rulers those proud steeds demand and scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand
even great achilles scarce their rage can tame achilles sprung from an immortal dame but say be faithful and the truth recite
where lies encamp the trojan chief to night where stand his coursers in what quarter sleep their other princes tell what watch they keep
say since this conquest what their counsels are or here to combat from their city far or back to ilion walls transfer the war
ulysses thus and thus eumedes son what dolon knows his faithful tongue shall own stern_hector the peers assembling in his tent a council holds at ilus monument
no certain guards the nightly watch partake where er yon fires ascend the trojans wake anxious for troy the guard the natives keep
safe in their cares the auxiliar forces sleep whose wife and infant from the danger far discharge their souls of half the fears of war
to whom the spy their powers they thus dispose the paeons dreadful with their bended bows the carians caucons the pelasgian host and leleges encamp along the coast
then sleep those aids among the trojan train inquired the chief or scattered er the plain not distant far lie higher on the land
these troy but lately to her succour won led on by rhesus great eioneus son i saw his coursers in proud triumph go swift as the wind and white as winter snow rich silver plates his shining car infold his solid arms refulgent flame with gold no mortal shoulders suit the glorious load celestial panoply to grace a god
the lycian mysian and maeonian band and phrygia horse by thymbras ancient wall the thracians utmost and apart from all let me unhappy to your fleet be borne or leave me here a captive fate to mourn
to this tydides with a gloomy frown think not to live though all the truth be shown shall we dismiss thee in some future strife
in cruel chains till your return reveal the truth or falsehood of the news i tell to risk more bravely thy now forfeit life
sternly he spoke and as the wretch prepared with humble blandishment to stroke his beard like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew divides the neck and cuts the nerves in two
or that again our camps thou may st explore no once a traitor thou betray st no more one instant snatch his trembling soul to hell the head yet speaking
mutter as it fell the furry helmet from his brow they tear the wolf grey hide the unbended bow and spear
these great ulysses lifting to the skies to favouring pallas dedicates the prize great queen of arms receive this hostile spoil and let the thracian steeds reward our toil
this said the spoil with dropping gore defaced high on a spreading tamarisk he placed then heap with reeds and gathered boughs the plain to guide their footsteps to the place again
through the still night they cross the devious fields slippery with blood er arms and heaps of shields arriving where the thracian squadrons lay and eased in sleep the labours of the day
thee first of all the heavenly host we praise speed our labours and direct our ways ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band the horses yoked beside each warrior stand
their arms in order on the ground reclined through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined amidst lay rhesus stretch in sleep profound
and the white steeds behind his chariot bound the welcome sight ulysses first descries and points to diomed the tempting prize
now thy courage try approach the chariot and the steeds untie or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds urge thou the slaughter while i seize the steeds
the man the coursers and the car behold described by dolon with the arms of gold now brave tydides
pallas this said her hero bosom warms breathed in his heart and strung his nervous arms where er he pass a purple stream pursued his thirsty falchion fat with hostile blood bathed all his footsteps dyed the fields with gore and a low groan
so the grim lion from his nightly den erleaps the fences and invades the pen on sheep or goats resistless in his way he falls and foaming rends the guardless prey nor stopp the fury of his vengeful hand till twelve lay breathless of the thracian band
ulysses following as his partner slew back by the foot each slaughter warrior drew the milk white coursers studious to convey safe to the ships he wisely cleared the way
remurmur through the shore lest the fierce steeds not yet to battles bred should start and tremble at the heaps of dead
now twelve despatch the monarch last they found tydides falchion fix him to the ground just then a deathful dream minerva sent a warlike form appear before his tent whose visionary steel his bosom tore
ulysses now the snowy steeds detains and leads them fasten by the silver reins these with his bow unbent he lash along the scourge forgot on rhesus chariot hung then gave his friend the signal to retire
but him new dangers new achievements fire doubtful he stood or with his reeking blade to send more heroes to the infernal shade drag off the car where rhesus armour lay or heave with manly force and lift away
while unresolved the son of tydeus stands pallas appears and thus her chief commands enough my son from further slaughter cease regard thy safety and depart in peace haste to the ships the gotten spoil enjoy nor tempt too far the hostile gods of troy
so dream the monarch and awaked no more the voice divine confess the martial maid in haste he mounted and her word obey d
not unobserved they pass the god of light had watch his troy and mark minerva flight saw tydeus son with heavenly succour
the coursers fly before ulysses bow swift as the wind and white as winter snow bless and vengeful anger fill his sacred breast
swift to the trojan camp descends the power and wakes hippocoon in the morning hour on rhesus side accustom to attend a faithful kinsman and instructive friend
he rose and saw the field deform with blood an empty space where late the coursers stood the yet warm thracians panting on the coast for each he wept but for his rhesus most now while on rhesus name he calls in vain the gathering tumult spreads er all the plain on heaps the trojans rush with wild affright and wondering view the slaughters of the night
meanwhile the chiefs arriving at the shade where late the spoil of stern_hector spy were laid ulysses stopp to him tydides bore the trophy dropping yet with dolon gore then mounts again again their nimbler feet
the coursers ply and thunder towards the fleet illustration diomed and ulysses returning with the spoil of rhesus diomed and ulysses returning with the spoil of rhesus
methinks the noise of trampling steeds i hear thickening this way and gathering on my ear perhaps some horses of the trojan breed so may ye gods
old wise_nestor first perceived the approaching sound bespeaking thus the grecian peers around my pious hopes succeed the great tydides and ulysses bear return triumphant with this prize of war
yet much i fear ah may that fear be vain the chiefs outnumber by the trojan train perhaps even now pursued they seek the shore or oh
the chiefs appear and spring to earth the greeks dismiss their fear with word of friendship and extended hands they greet the kings and wise_nestor first demand
perhaps those heroes are no more scarce had he spoke when lo say thou whose praises all our host proclaim thou living glory of the grecian name
say whence these coursers by what chance bestow the spoil of foes or present of a god not those fair steeds so radiant and so gay
that draw the burning chariot of the day old as i am to age i scorn to yield and daily mingle in the martial field
but sure till now no coursers struck my sight like these conspicuous through the ranks of fight some god i deem conferred the glorious prize bless as ye are and favourites of the skies
the care of him who bids the thunder roar and her whose fury bathes the world with gore father not so sage ithacus rejoin
of thracian lineage are the steeds ye view whose hostile king the brave tydides slew sleeping he died with all his guards around and twelve beside lay gasping on the ground
these other spoil from conquer dolon came a wretch whose swiftness was his only fame by stern_hector sent our forces to explore he now lies headless on the sandy shore
the gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind then er the trench the bounding coursers flew the joyful greeks with loud acclaim pursue
straight to tydides high pavilion borne the matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn the neighing coursers their new fellows greet and the full racks are heap with generous wheat
but dolon armour to his ships convey high on the painted stern_hector ulysses laid a trophy destin to the blue eyed maid
then in the polished bath refresh from toil their joints they supple with dissolving oil in due repast indulge the genial hour and first to pallas
now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain they cleanse their bodies in the neighb ring main the libations pour they sit rejoicing in her aid divine and the crown goblet foams with floods of wine
agamemnon having armed himself leads the grecians to battle stern_hector prepares the trojans to receive them while jupiter juno and minerva give the signals of war
agamemnon bears all before him and stern_hector is commanded by jupiter who sends iris for that purpose to decline the engagement till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field
ulysses and diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter being wounded by paris is obliged to desert his companion who is encompassed by the trojans wounded and in the utmost danger till great_menelaus and oilean_ajax rescue him
book xi argument the third battle and the acts of agamemnon he then makes a great slaughter of the enemy stern_hector comes against oilean_ajax but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies the greeks
in the meantime machaon in the other wing of the army is pierced with an arrow by paris and carried from the fight in wise_nestor chariot
achilles who overlooked the action from his ship sent patroclus to inquire which of the greeks was wounded in that manner wise_nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day and a long recital of some former wars which he remembered tending to put patroclus upon persuading achilles to fight for his countrymen or at least to permit him to do it clad in achilles armour
this book opens with the eight and twentieth day of the poem and the same day with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and part of the eighteenth books
patroclus on his return meets eurypylus also wounded and assists him in that distress the scene lies in the field near the monument of ilus
now rose refulgent from tithonus bed with new born day to gladden mortal sight and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light when baleful eris sent by which_jove command the torch of discord blazing in her hand through the red skies her bloody sign extends
the saffron morn with early blushes spread and wrapt in tempests er the fleet descends high on ulysses bark her horrid stand
even oilean_ajax and achilles heard the sound whose ships remote the guarded navy bound thence the black fury through the grecian throng
with horror sounds the loud orthian song the navy shakes and at the dire alarms each bosom boils each warrior starts to arms
she took and thunder through the sea and land no more they sigh inglorious to return but breathe revenge and for the combat burn
illustration the descent of discord the descent of discord the king of men his hardy host inspires with loud command with great example fires
and first he cased his manly legs around in shining greaves with silver buckles bound the beaming cuirass next adorn his breast the same which once king cinyras
possess the fame of greece and her assembled host had reach that monarch on the cyprian coast twas then the friendship of the chief to gain this glorious gift he sent nor sent in vain
ten rows of azure steel the work infold twice ten of tin and twelve of ductile gold three glittering dragons to the gorget rise
himself first rose himself before the rest his mighty limbs in radiant armour dress whose imitated scales against the skies reflected various light and arching bow like colour rainbows er a showery cloud
a radiant baldric er his shoulder tied sustain the sword that glitter at his side gold was the hilt a silver sheath encased the shining blade and golden hangers graced
which_jove wondrous bow of three celestial dies placed as a sign to man amidst the skies his buckler mighty orb was next
that round the warrior cast a dreadful shade ten zones of brass its ample brim surround and twice ten bosses the bright convex crown
tremendous gorgon frown upon its field and circling terrors fill the expressive shield within its concave hung a silver thong on which a mimic serpent creeps along his azure length in easy waves extends till in three heads the embroider monster end
last er his brows his fourfold helm he placed with nodding horse hair formidably graced and in his hands two steely javelins wields that blaze to heaven and lighten all the fields
that instant juno and the martial maid in happy thunders promised greece their aid high er the chief they clash their arms in air and leaning from the clouds expect the war
close to the limits of the trench and mound the fiery coursers to their chariots bound the squires restrain the foot with those who wield the lighter arms rush forward to the field
display to second these in close array combined the squadrons spread their sable wings behind now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun as with the light the warriors toils begun
even which_jove whose thunder spoke his wrath distill red drops of blood er all the fatal field the woes of men unwilling to survey and all the slaughters that must stain the day
near ilus tomb in order ranged around the trojan lines possess the rising ground there wise_nestor polydamas and stern_hector stood ćneas honour as a guardian god bold polybus agenor the divine the brother warriors of antenor line
with youthful acamas whose beauteous face and fair proportion match the ethereal race great stern_hector cover with his spacious shield plies all the troops and orders all the field
as the red star now shows his sanguine fires through the dark clouds and now in night retires thus through the ranks
appear the godlike man plunged in the rear or blazing in the van while streamy sparkles restless as he flies flash from his arms as lightning from the skies
as sweating reapers in some wealthy field ranged in two bands their crooked weapons wield bear down the furrows till their labours meet thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet
so greece and troy the field of war divide and falling ranks are strow on every side none stoop a thought to base inglorious flight
but horse to horse and man to man they fight not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey each wounds each bleeds but none resign the day
discord alone of all the immortal train swells the red horrors of this direful plain the gods in peace their golden mansions fill ranged in bright order on the olympian hill
discord with joy the scene of death descries and drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes but general murmurs told their griefs above and each accused the partial will of which_jove
meanwhile apart superior and alone the eternal monarch on his awful throne wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate and fix fulfill the just decrees of fate
on earth he turn his all considering eyes and mark the spot where ilion towers arise the sea with ships the fields with armies spread the victor rage the dying and the dead
thus while the morning beams increasing bright er heaven pure azure spread the glowing light commutual death the fate of war confounds each adverse battle gored with equal wounds
but now what time in some sequester vale the weary woodman spreads his sparing meal when his tired arms refuse the axe to rear and claim a respite from the sylvan war but not till half the prostrate forests lay stretch in long ruin and exposed to day
great agamemnon then the slaughter led and slew bienor at his people head whose squire oileus with a sudden spring leap from the chariot to revenge his king but in his front he felt the fatal wound which pierced his brain and stretch him on the ground
then nor till then the greeks impulsive might pierced the black phalanx and let in the light atrides spoil and left them on the plain vain was their youth
their glittering armour vain now soil with dust and naked to the sky their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie two son of priam next to battle move the product one of marriage one of love
in the same car the brother warriors ride this took the charge to combat that to guide far other task than when they wont to keep on ida tops their father fleecy sheep
these on the mountain once achilles found and captive led with pliant osiers bound then to their sire for ample sums restored but now to perish by atrides sword pierced in the breast the base born isus bleeds
cleft through the head his brother fate succeeds swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls and stript their features to his mind recalls
the trojans see the youths untimely die but helpless tremble for themselves and fly so when a lion ranging er the lawns
finds on some grassy lair the couching fawns their bones he cracks their reeking vitals draws and grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws the frighted hind beholds and dares not stay but swift through rustling thickets bursts her way all drown in sweat the panting mother flies and the big tears roll trickling from her eyes
amidst the tumult of the routed train the son of false antimachus were slain he who for bribes his faithless counsels sold and voted argive_helen stay for paris gold
atrides mark as these their safety sought and slew the children for the father fault their headstrong horse unable to restrain they shook with fear and dropp the silken rein then in the chariot on their knees they fall and thus with lifted hands for mercy call spare our youth and for the life we owe antimachus shall copious gifts bestow soon as he hears that not in battle slain the grecian ships his captive son detain large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told and steel well tempered and persuasive gold
these word attended with the flood of tears the youths address to unrelenting ears the vengeful monarch gave this stern_hector reply if from antimachus ye spring ye die the daring wretch who once in council stood to shed ulysses and my brother blood for proffer peace and sues his seed for grace
no die and pay the forfeit of your race this said pisander from the car he cast and pierced his breast supine he breathed his last
his brother leap to earth but as he lay the trenchant falchion lopp his hands away his sever head was toss among the throng and rolling drew a bloody train along
then where the thickest fought the victor flew the king example all his greeks pursue now by the foot the flying foot were slain horse trod by horse lay foaming on the plain
the brass hoof steeds tumultuous plunge and bound and the thick thunder beats the labouring ground still slaughtering on the king of men proceeds the distanced army wonders at his deeds as when the winds with raging flames conspire and er the forests roll the flood of fire
in blazing heaps the grove old honours fall and one refulgent ruin levels all before atrides rage so sinks the foe whole squadrons vanish and proud heads lie low
the steeds fly trembling from his waving sword and many a car now lighted of its lord wide er the field with guideless fury rolls breaking their ranks and crushing out their souls while his keen falchion drinks the warriors lives more grateful now to vultures than their wife
from the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise shade the black host and intercept the skies perhaps great stern_hector then had found his fate but which_jove and destiny prolong his date
safe from the darts the care of heaven he stood amidst alarms and death and dust and blood now past the tomb where ancient ilus lay through the mid field the routed urge their way
where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown the path they take and speed to reach the town as swift atrides with loud shouts pursued hot with his toil and bathed in hostile blood
now near the beech tree and the scaean gates the hero halts and his associates waits meanwhile on every side around the plain dispersed disorder fly the trojan train
the lion roaring through the midnight shade on heaps they tumble with successless haste the savage seizes draws and rends the last
so flies a herd of beeves that hear dismay not with less fury stern_hector atrides flew still press the rout and still the hindmost slew
hurl from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill and rage and death and carnage load the field now storms the victor at the trojan wall surveys the towers and meditates their fall
but which_jove descending shook the idaean hills and down their summits pour a hundred rills the unkindled lightning in his hand he took and thus the many coloured maid bespoke iris with haste thy golden wings display to godlike stern_hector this our word convey
fights in the front and bathes with blood the ground bid him give way but issue forth commands and trust the war to less important hands
but when or wounded by the spear or dart that chief shall mount his chariot and depart then which_jove shall string his arm and fire his breast then to her ships shall flying greece be press
while agamemnon wastes the ranks around till to the main the burning sun descend and sacred night her awful shade extend
he spoke and iris at his word obey on wings of winds descends the various maid the chief she found amidst the ranks of war close to the bulwarks on his glittering car
while agamemnon wastes the ranks around fights in the front and bathes with blood the ground abstain from fight yet issue forth commands and trust the war to less important hands but when or wounded by the spear or dart the chief shall mount his chariot and depart then which_jove shall string thy arm and fire thy breast then to her ships shall flying greece be press
the goddess then son of priam hear from which_jove i come and his high mandate bear till to the main the burning sun descend and sacred night her awful shade extend
she said and vanish stern_hector with a bound springs from his chariot on the trembling ground in clanging arms he grasps in either hand
a pointed lance and speeds from band to band revives their ardour turns their steps from flight and wakes anew the dying flames of fight
new force new spirit to each breast returns the fight renew with fiercer fury burns the king leads on all fix on him their eye and learn from him to conquer or to die
they stand to arms the greeks their onset dare condense their powers and wait the coming war ye sacred nine celestial muses
tell who faced him first and by his prowess fell the great iphidamas the bold and young from sage antenor and theano sprung
scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest and early honour warm his generous breast when the kind sire consign his daughter charms theano sister to his youthful arms
but call by glory to the wars of troy he leaves untasted the first fruits of joy from his loved bride departs with melting eyes and swift to aid his dearer country flies
whom from his youth his grandsire cisseus bred and nursed in thrace where snowy flocks are fed with twelve black ships
he reach percope strand thence took the long laborious march by land now fierce for fame before the ranks he springs towering in arms and braves the king of kings
atrides first discharged the missive spear the trojan stoop the javelin pass in air then near the corslet at the monarch heart with all his strength the youth directs his dart
but the broad belt with plates of silver bound the point rebated and repell the wound encumber with the dart atrides stands till grasp with force he wrench d
it from his hands at once his weighty sword discharged a wound full on his neck that fell him to the ground
stretch in the dust the unhappy warrior lies and sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes oh worthy better fate oh early slain
thy country friend and virtuous though in vain no more the youth shall join his consort side at once a virgin and at once a bride
no more with presents her embraces meet or lay the spoil of conquest at her feet on whom his passion lavish of his store bestow so much and vainly promised more
unwept uncover on the plain he lay while the proud victor bore his arms away coon antenor eldest hope was nigh
tears at the sight came starting from his eye while pierced with grief the much loved youth he view and the pale features now deform with blood
then with his spear unseen his time he took aim at the king and near his elbow strook the thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part and through his arm stood forth the barbed dart
on coon rushes with his lifted spear his brother corpse the pious trojan draws and calls his country to assert his cause defends him breathless on the sanguine field and er the body spreads his ample shield
atrides marking an unguarded part transfix the warrior with his brazen dart prone on his brother bleeding breast he lay the monarch falchion lopp d
surprised the monarch feels yet void of fear his head away the social shades the same dark journey go and join each other in the realms below
with every weapon art or fury yields by the long lance the sword or ponderous stone whole ranks are broken and whole troops erthrown
this while yet warm distill the purple flood but when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend less keen those darts
the vengeful victor rages round the fields the fierce ilythiae send the powers that cause the teeming matron throes sad mothers of unutterable woes
stung with the smart all panting with the pain he mounts the car and gives his squire the rein then with a voice which fury made more strong and pain augmented thus exhorts the throng friends
o greeks assert your honours won proceed and finish what this arm begun lo angry which_jove forbids your chief to stay and envies half the glories of the day
clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow and from their sides the foam descends in snow shot through the battle in a moment space
he said the driver whirls his lengthful thong the horses fly the chariot smokes along the wounded monarch at his tent they place
no sooner stern_hector saw the king retired but thus his trojans and his aids he fired hear all ye dardan all ye lycian race
famed in close fight and dreadful face to face now call to mind your ancient trophies won your great forefathers virtues and your own
behold the general flies deserts his powers lo which_jove himself declares the conquest ours now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds and sure of glory dare immortal deeds
as the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear the brindled lion or the tusky bear with voice and hand provokes their doubting heart and springs the foremost with his lifted dart so godlike stern_hector prompts his troops to dare nor prompts alone but leads himself the war
on the black body of the foe he pours as from the cloud deep bosom swell with showers a sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps drives the wild waves and tosses all the deeps
with word like these the fiery chief alarms his fainting host and every bosom warms say muse when which_jove the trojan glory crown beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground
assaeus dolops and autonous died opites next was added to their side then brave hipponous famed in many a fight opheltius orus sunk to endless night ćsymnus agelaus all chiefs of name the rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame
as when a western whirlwind charged with storms dispels the gather clouds that notus forms the gust continued violent and strong rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along now to the skies the foaming billows rears now breaks the surge and wide the bottom bares
now the last ruin the whole host appals now greece had trembled in her wooden walls but wise_nestor ulysses call tydides forth his soul rekindled and awaked his worth
thus raging stern_hector with resistless hands erturns confounds and scatters all their bands and stand we deedless eternal shame
till stern_hector arm involve the ships in flame haste let us join and combat side by side the warrior thus and thus the friend replied
no martial toil i shun no danger fear let stern_hector come i wait his fury here but which_jove with conquest crowns the trojan train
but sighing raised his vengeful steel and from his car the proud thymbraeus fell molion the charioteer pursued his lord his death ennobled by ulysses sword
and which_jove our foe all human force is vain he sigh there slain they left them in eternal night then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight
so two wild boars outstrip the following hounds then swift revert and wounds return for wounds stern_hector conquests in the middle plain stood check awhile and greece respired again
the son of merops shone amidst the war towering they rode in one refulgent car in deep prophetic arts their father skill had warn his children from the trojan field
they rush to fight and perish on the plain their breasts no more the vital spirit warms the stern_hector tydides strips their shining arms
fate urged them on the father warn in vain hypirochus by great ulysses dies and rich hippodamus becomes his prize great which_jove from ide with slaughter fills his sight and level hangs the doubtful scale of fight
agastrophus was slain the far famed hero of paeonian strain wing with his fears on foot he strove to fly his steeds too distant and the foe too nigh through broken orders swifter than the wind he fled but flying left his life behind
by tydeus lance this stern_hector sees as his experienced eyes traverse the files and to the rescue flies shouts as he pass the crystal regions rend and moving armies on his march attend
great diomed himself was seized with fear and thus bespoke his brother of the war mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield
swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled nor miss its aim but where the plumage danced razed the smooth cone and thence obliquely glanced
the storm rolls on and stern_hector rules the field here stand his utmost force the warrior said safe in his helm the gift of phoebus hands
his arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain er his dim sight the misty vapours rise and a short darkness shades his swimming eyes
tydides followed to regain his lance while stern_hector rose recover from the trance remounts his car and herds amidst the crowd
the greek pursues him and exults aloud once more thank phoebus for thy forfeit breath or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death
without a wound the trojan hero stands but yet so stunn that staggering on the plain well by apollo are thy prayers repaid and oft that partial power has lent his aid
thou shall not long the death deserved withstand if any god assist tydides hand fly then inglorious but thy flight this day whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay him while he triumph paris eyed from far
the spouse of argive_helen the fair cause of war around the fields his feather shafts he sent from ancient ilus ruin monument
behind the column placed he bent his bow and wing an arrow at the unwary foe just as he stoop agastrophus crest to seize and drew the corslet from his breast the bowstring twang nor flew the shaft in vain but pierced his foot and nail it to the plain
the laughing trojan with a joyful spring leaps from his ambush and insults the king he bleeds he cries some god has sped my dart
so troy relieved from that wide wasting hand should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand whose son now tremble at his darted spear as scatter lambs the rushing lion fear
would the same god had fix it in his heart he dauntless thus thou conqueror of the fair thou woman warrior with the curling hair vain archer
trusting to the distant dart unskill in arms to act a manly part thou hast but done what boys or women can such hands may wound but not incense a man
nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave a coward weapon never hurts the brave not so this dart which thou may st one day feel
fate wings its flight and death is on the steel where this but lights some noble life expires its touch makes orphans bathes the cheeks of sires steeps earth in purple gluts the birds of air and leaves such objects as distract the fair
ulysses hastens with a trembling heart before him steps and bending draws the dart forth flows the blood an eager pang succeeds tydides mounts and to the navy speeds
now on the field ulysses stands alone the greeks all fled the trojans pouring on but stands collected in himself and whole and questions thus his own unconquer soul what further subterfuge what hopes remain
what shame inglorious if i quit the plain what danger singly if i stand the ground my friends all scatter all the foes around
yet wherefore doubtful let this truth suffice the brave meets danger and the coward flies to die or conquer proves a hero heart and knowing this i know a soldier part
such thought revolving in his careful breast near and more near the shady cohorts press these in the warrior their own fate enclose and round him deep the steely circle grows
so fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds he grinds his ivory tusks he foams with ire his sanguine eye balls glare with living fire by these by those on every part is plied and the red slaughter spreads on every side
pierced through the shoulder first deiopis fell next ennomus and thoon sank to hell chersidamas beneath the navel thrust falls prone to earth and grasps the bloody dust
charops the son of hippasus was near ulysses reach him with the fatal spear but to his aid his brother socus flies socus the brave the generous and the wise_nestor
near as he drew the warrior thus began great ulysses much enduring man not deeper skill in every martial sleight than worn to toils and active in the fight
this day two brothers shall thy conquest grace and end at once the great hippasian race or thou beneath this lance must press the field
he said and forceful pierced his spacious shield through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown plough half his side and bared it to the bone
by pallas care the spear though deep infix stopp short of life nor with his entrails mix the wound not mortal wise_nestor ulysses knew then furious thus but first some steps withdrew
unhappy man whose death our hands shall grace fate calls thee hence and finish is thy race nor longer check my conquests on the foe
he spoke while socus seized with sudden fright trembling gave way and turn his back to flight between his shoulders pierced the following dart and held its passage through the panting heart wide in his breast
but pierced by this to endless darkness go and add one spectre to the realms below appear the grisly wound he falls his armour rings against the ground
then thus ulysses gazing on the slain famed son of hippasus there press the plain there end thy narrow span assign by fate heaven owes ulysses yet a longer date
no father shall thy corpse compose thy dying eyes no tender mother close but hungry birds shall tear those balls away and hovering vultures scream around their prey
ah wretch me greece shall honour when i meet my doom with solemn funerals and a lasting tomb then raging with intolerable smart he writhes his body and extracts the dart
the dart a tide of spouting gore pursued and gladden troy with sight of hostile blood now troops on troops the fainting chief invade forced he recedes and loudly calls for aid
thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears the well known voice thrice great_menelaus hears alarm to oilean_ajax ajax_telamon he cried
ulysses shouts invade my ear distressed he seems and no assistance near strong as he is yet one opposed to all oppress by multitudes the best may fall
who shares his labours and defends his side friend greece robb of him must bid her host despair and feel a loss not ages can repair
great oilean_ajax like the god of war attends the prudent chief in sore distress they found with bands of furious trojans compass round
as when some huntsman with a flying spear from the blind thicket wounds a stately deer down his cleft side while fresh the blood distils he bounds aloft and scuds from hills to hills till life warm vapour issuing through the wound wild mountain wolves the fainting beast surround just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade the lion rushes through the woodland shade the wolves though hungry scour dispersed away the lordly savage vindicates his prey
then where the cry directs his course he bends ulysses thus unconquer by his pains a single warrior half a host sustains
but soon as oilean_ajax leaves his tower like shield the scattered crowds fly frighted er the field atrides arm the sinking hero stays and saved from numbers to his car conveys
victorious oilean_ajax plies the routed crew and first doryclus priam son he slew on strong pandocus next inflicts a wound and lays lysander bleeding on the ground
as when a torrent swell with wintry rains pours from the mountain er the deluged plains and pines and oaks from their foundations torn a country ruins
but stern_hector from this scene of slaughter far raged on the left and ruled the tide of war loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain and deep scamander swells with heaps of slain
there wise_nestor and idomeneus oppose the warrior fury there the battle glows there fierce on foot or from the chariot height his sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight
to the sea are borne fierce oilean_ajax thus erwhelms the yielding throng men steeds and chariots roll in heaps along the spouse of argive_helen dealing darts around had pierced machaon with a distant wound
in his right shoulder the broad shaft appear and trembling greece for her physician fear to wise_nestor then idomeneus begun glory of greece old neleus valiant son
ascend thy chariot haste with speed away and great machaon to the ships convey a wise_nestor physician skill our wounds to heal is more than armies to the public weal
old wise_nestor mounts the seat beside him rode the wounded offspring of the healing god he lends the lash the steeds with sounding feet shake the dry field and thunder toward the fleet
but now cebriones from stern_hector car survey the various fortune of the war while here he cried the flying greeks are slain trojans on trojans yonder load the plain
before great oilean_ajax see the mingled throng of men and chariots driven in heaps along i know him well distinguish o er the field
thither stern_hector thither urge thy steeds there danger calls and there the combat bleeds there horse and foot in mingled deaths unite and groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight
thus having spoke the driver lash resounds swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds stung by the stroke the coursers scour the fields er heaps of carcases and hills of shields
the horses hoofs are bathed in heroes gore and dashing purple all the car before the groaning axle sable drops distils and mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels
here stern_hector plunging through the thickest fight broke the dark phalanx and let in the light by the long lance the sword or ponderous stone
by the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield the ranks he scatter and the troops erthrown oilean_ajax he shuns through all the dire debate and fears that arm whose force he felt so late
but partial which_jove espousing stern_hector part shot heaven bred horror through the grecian heart confused unnerved in stern_hector presence grown amazed he stood with terrors not his own
thus the grim lion his retreat maintains beset with watchful dogs and shouting swains repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls though rage impels him and though hunger calls long stands the showering darts and missile fires then sourly slow the indignant beast retires so turn stern_hector oilean_ajax by whole hosts repell while his swoln heart at every step rebell
as the slow beast with heavy strength endued in some wide field by troops of boys pursued though round his sides a wooden tempest rain crops the tall harvest and lays waste the plain thick on his hide the hollow blows resound
the patient animal maintains his ground scarce from the field with all their efforts chased and stirs but slowly when he stirs at last on oilean_ajax thus a weight of trojans hung the strokes redoubled on his buckler rung
confiding now in bulky strength he stands now turns and backward bears the yielding bands now stiff recedes yet hardly seems to fly
o er his broad back his moony shield he threw and glaring round by tardy steps withdrew and threats his followers with retorted eye
while hissing darts descend in iron showers in his broad buckler many a weapon stood its surface bristled with a quivering wood and many a javelin guiltless on the plain marks the dry dust and thirsts for blood in vain
but bold eurypylus his aid imparts and dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts whose eager javelin launch against the foe great apisaon felt the fatal blow from his torn liver the red current flow and his slack knees desert their dying load
the victor rushing to despoil the dead from paris bow a vengeful arrow fled fix in his nervous thigh the weapon stood fix was the point but broken was the wood
back to the lines the wounded greek retired yet thus retreating his associates fired what god grecians has your hearts dismay
fix as the bar between two warring powers oh turn to arms tis oilean_ajax claims your aid this hour he stands the mark of hostile rage and this the last brave battle he shall wage
thus urged the chief a generous troop appears who spread their bucklers and advance their spears to guard their wounded friend while thus they stand with pious care great oilean_ajax joins the band each takes new courage at the hero sight the hero rallies and renews the fight
thus raged both armies like conflicting fires while wise_nestor chariot far from fight retires his coursers steep in sweat and stain with gore the greeks preserver great machaon bore
that hour achilles from the topmost height of his proud fleet erlook the fields of fight his feasted eyes beheld around the plain
haste join your forces from the gloomy grave the warrior rescue and your country save the grecian rout the slaying and the slain
his friend machaon singled from the rest a transient pity touch his vengeful breast straight to menoetius much loved son he sent graceful as mars patroclus quits his tent
in evil hour then fate decreed his doom and fix the date of all his woes to come why calls my friend
thy loved injunctions lay whate er thy will patroclus shall obey first of friends pelides thus replied still at my heart and ever at my side
the time is come when yon despairing host shall learn the value of the man they lost now at my knees the greeks shall pour their moan and proud atrides tremble on his throne
go now to wise_nestor and from him be taught what wounded warrior late his chariot brought for seen at distance and but seen behind his form recall d
machaon to my mind nor could i through yon cloud discern his face the coursers pass me with so swift a pace
the hero said his friend obey with haste through intermingled ships and tents he pass the chiefs descending from their car he found
the warriors standing on the breezy shore to dry their sweat and wash away the gore here paused a moment while the gentle gale convey d
that freshness the cool sea exhale then to consult on farther methods went and took their seats beneath the shady tent
the panting steeds eurymedon unbound the draught prescribed fair hecamede prepares arsinous daughter graced with golden hairs whom to his aged arms a royal slave greece as the prize of wise_nestor wisdom gave
a table first with azure feet she placed whose ample orb a brazen charger graced honey new press the sacred flour of wheat and wholesome garlic crown the savoury treat next her white hand an antique goblet brings a goblet sacred to the pylian kings from eldest times
emboss with studs of gold two feet support it and four handles hold on each bright handle bending er the brink in sculptured gold two turtles seem to drink
temper in this the nymph of form divine pours a large portion of the pramnian wine with goat milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows and last with flour the smiling surface strows
this for the wounded prince the dame prepares the cordial beverage reverend wise_nestor shares salubrious draughts the warriors thirst allay and pleasing conference beguiles the day
a massy weight yet heaved with ease by him when the brisk nectar overlook the brim meantime patroclus by achilles sent unheard approached and stood before the tent
old wise_nestor rising then the hero led to his high seat the chief refused and said tis now no season for these kind delays the great achilles with impatience stays
to great achilles this respect i owe who asks what hero wounded by the foe was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds
with grief i see the great machaon bleeds this to report my hasty course i bend thou know st the fiery temper of my friend
can then the son of greece the sage rejoin excite compassion in achilles mind seeks he the sorrows of our host to know
tell him not great machaon bleeds alone our bravest heroes in the navy groan ulysses agamemnon diomed and stern_hector eurypylus already bleed
achilles heeds not but derides our pain even till the flames consume our fleet he stays and waits the rising of the fatal blaze
this is not half the story of our woe but ah what flattering hopes i entertain chief after chief the raging foe destroys calm he looks on and every death enjoys
now the slow course of all impairing time unstrings my nerves and end my manly prime oh had i still that strength my youth
possess when this bold arm the epeian powers oppress the bulls of elis in glad triumph led and stretch the great itymonaeus dead
then from my fury fled the trembling swains and ours was all the plunder of the plains fifty white flocks full fifty herds of swine
as many goats as many lowing kine and thrice the number of unrivall steeds all teeming females and of generous breeds
these as my first essay of arms i won old neleus gloried in his conquering son thus elis forced her long arrears restored and shares were parted to each pylian lord
the state of pyle was sunk to last despair when the proud elians first commenced the war for neleus son alcides rage had slain of twelve bold brothers i alone remain
that large reprisal he might justly claim for prize defrauded and insulted fame when elis monarch at the public course detain his chariot and victorious horse
oppress we arm and now this conquest gain my sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain the rest the people shared myself survey d
three days were past when elis rose to war with many a courser and with many a car the son of actor at their army head young as they were the vengeful squadrons led
high on the rock fair thryoessa stands our utmost frontier on the pylian lands not far the streams of famed alphaeus flow the stream they pass and pitch their tents below
the just partition and due victims paid pallas descending in the shades of night alarms the pylians and commands the fight
each burns for fame and swells with martial pride myself the foremost but my sire denied fear for my youth exposed to stern_hector alarms and stopp my chariot and detain my arms
along fair arene delightful plain soft minyas rolls his waters to the main there horse and foot the pylian troops unite and sheathed in arms expect the dawning light
my sire denied in vain on foot i fled amidst our chariots for the goddess led thence ere the sun advanced his noon day flame to great alphaeus sacred source we came
there first to which_jove our solemn rites were paid an untamed heifer pleased the blue eyed maid a bull alphaeus and a bull was slain to the blue monarch of the watery main
in arms we slept beside the winding flood while round the town the fierce epeians stood soon as the sun with all revealing ray flamed in the front of heaven and gave the day
the first who fell beneath my javelin bled king augias son and spouse of agamede she that all simples healing virtues knew and every herb that drinks the morning dew
bright scenes of arms and works of war appear the nations meet there pylos elis here i seized his car the van of battle led the epeians saw they trembled and they fled
the foe dispersed their bravest warrior kill fierce as the whirlwind now i swept the field full fifty captive chariots graced my train
two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain then actor son had died but neptune shrouds the youthful heroes in a veil of clouds
o er heapy shields and er the prostrate throng collecting spoil and slaughtering all along through wide buprasian fields we forced the foes where er the vales the olenian rocks arose till pallas stopp us where alisium flows
even there the hindmost of the rear i slay and the same arm that led concludes the day then back to pyle triumphant take my way
there to high which_jove were public thanks assign as first of gods to wise_nestor of mankind such then i was impell by youthful blood so proved my valour for my country good
how shall he grieve when to the eternal shade her hosts shall sink nor his the power to aid friend
my memory recalls the day when gathering aids along the grecian sea i and ulysses touch at phthia port and entered peleus hospitable court
achilles with unactive fury glows and gives to passion what to greece he owes a bull to which_jove he slew in sacrifice and pour libations on the flaming thighs
thyself achilles and thy reverend sire menoetius turn the fragments on the fire achilles sees us to the feast invites social we sit and share the genial rites
we then explained the cause on which we came urged you to arms and found you fierce for fame your ancient fathers generous precepts gave peleus said only this my son be brave
menoetius thus though great achilles shine in strength superior and of race divine yet cooler thought thy elder years attend let thy just counsels aid and rule thy friend
ah try the utmost that a friend can say such gentle force the fiercest minds obey some favouring god achilles heart may move though deaf to glory he may yield to love
thus spoke your father at thessalia court word now forgot though now of vast import if some dire oracle his breast alarm if aught from heaven withhold his saving arm
if thou but lead the myrmidonian line clad in achilles arms if thou appear proud troy may tremble and desist from war press by fresh forces her er labour train
this touch his generous heart and from the tent along the shore with hasty strides he went soon as he came where on the crowded strand the public mart and courts of justice stand where the tall fleet of great ulysses lies and altars to the guardian gods arise there sad he met the brave euaemon son large painful drops from all his members run an arrow head yet rooted in his wound
some beam of comfort yet on greece may shine shall seek their walls and greece respire again the sable blood in circle mark the ground
as faintly reeling he confess the smart weak was his pace but dauntless was his heart divine compassion touch patroclus breast
who sighing thus his bleeding friend address ah hapless leaders of the grecian host thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast
is this your fate to glut the dogs with gore far from your friends and from your native shore say great eurypylus
shall greece yet stand resists she yet the raging stern_hector hand or are her heroes doom to die with shame and this the period of our wars and fame
eurypylus replies no more my friend greece is no more this day her glories end even to the ships victorious troy pursues her force increasing as her toil renews
those chiefs that used her utmost rage to meet lie pierced with wounds and bleeding in the fleet but thou patroclus act a friendly part lead to my ships and draw this deadly dart
with lukewarm water wash the gore away with healing balms the raging smart allay such as sage chiron sire of pharmacy
of two famed surgeons podalirius stands this hour surrounded by the trojan bands and great machaon wounded in his tent now wants that succour which so oft he lent
once taught achilles and achilles thee to him the chief what then remains to do the event of things the gods alone can view
charged by achilles great command i fly and bear with haste the pylian king reply but thy distress this instant claims relief
he said and in his arms upheld the chief the slave their master slow approach survey and hides of oxen on the floor display
at length the wounded hero lay patroclus cut the forky steel away then in his hands a bitter root he bruised the wound he wash the styptic juice infused
there stretch the closing flesh that instant ceased to glow the wound to torture and the blood to flow illustration hercules
the greeks having retired into their intrenchments stern_hector attempts to force them but it proving impossible to pass the ditch polydamas advises to quit their chariots and manage the attack on foot
hercules book xii argument the battle at the grecian wall the trojans follow his counsel and having divided their army into five bodies of foot begin the assault
but upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons which appeared on the left hand of the trojans polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again
stern_hector also casting a stone of vast size forces open one of the gates and enters at the head of his troops who victoriously pursue the grecians even to their ships
while thus the hero pious cares attend the cure and safety of his wounded friend trojans and greeks with clashing shields engage and mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage
nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose with gods averse the ill fated works arose their powers neglected and no victim slain the walls were raised the trenches sunk in vain
this stern_hector opposes and continues the attack in which after many actions sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall without the gods how short a period stands the proudest monument of mortal hands
while sacred troy the warring hosts engaged but when her son were slain her city burn and what survived of greece to greece return then neptune and apollo shook the shore
then ida summits pour their watery store rhesus and rhodius then unite their rills caresus roaring down the stony hills ćsepus granicus with mingled force and xanthus foaming from his fruitful source and gulfy simois rolling to the main
these turn by phoebus from their wonted ways deluged the rampire nine continual days the weight of waters saps the yielding wall and to the sea the floating bulwarks fall
this stood while stern_hector and achilles raged helmets and shields and godlike heroes slain incessant cataracts the thunderer pours and half the skies descend in sluicy showers
the god of ocean marching stern_hector before with his huge trident wounds the trembling shore vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves and whelms the smoky ruin in the waves
now smooth with sand and levell by the flood no fragment tells where once the wonder stood in their old bounds the rivers roll again shine twixt the hills or wander er the plain
but this the gods in later times perform as yet the bulwark stood and braved the storm the strokes yet echoed of contending powers war thunder at the gates and blood distain d
the towers smote by the arm of which_jove with dire dismay close by their hollow ships the grecians lay stern_hector approach in every wind they hear and stern_hector fury every moment fear
so midst the dogs and hunters daring bands fierce of his might a boar or lion stands arm foes around a dreadful circle form and hissing javelins rain an iron storm
his powers untamed their bold assault defy and where he turns the rout disperse or die he foams he glares he bounds against them all
he like a whirlwind toss the scattering throng mingled the troops and drove the field along and if he falls his courage makes him fall
the panting steeds impatient fury breathe and snort and tremble at the gulf beneath just at the brink they neigh and paw the ground and the turf trembles and the skies resound
with equal rage encompass stern_hector glows exhorts his armies and the trenches shows eager they view the prospect dark and deep vast was the leap and headlong hung the steep the bottom bare a formidable show
and bristled thick with sharpen stakes below the foot alone this strong defence could force and try the pass impervious to the horse
this saw polydamas who wisely brave restrain great stern_hector and this counsel gave thou bold leader of the trojan bands
and you confederate chiefs from foreign lands what entrance here can cumbrous chariots find the stakes beneath the grecian walls behind
no pass through those without a thousand wounds no space for combat in yon narrow bounds proud of the favours mighty
which_jove has shown on certain dangers we too rashly run if tis will our haughty foes to tame oh may this instant end the grecian name
here far from argos let their heroes fall and one great day destroy and bury all but should they turn and here oppress our train what hopes what methods of retreat remain
wedged in the trench by our own troops confused in one promiscuous carnage crush and bruised all troy must perish if their arms prevail nor shall a trojan live to tell the tale
hear then ye warriors and obey with speed back from the trenches let your steeds be led then all alighting wedged in firm array proceed on foot and stern_hector lead the way
so greece shall stoop before our conquering power and this if which_jove consent her fatal hour illustration polydamas advising stern_hector polydamas advising stern_hector
this counsel pleased the godlike stern_hector sprung swift from his seat his clanging armour rung the chief example follow by his train
each quits his car and issues on the plain by orders strict the charioteers enjoin compel the coursers to their ranks behind
the forces part in five distinguish bands and all obey their several chiefs commands the best and bravest in the first conspire pant for the fight and threat the fleet with fire
great stern_hector glorious in the van of these polydamas and brave cebriones before the next the graceful paris shines and bold alcathous and agenor joins
the son of priam with the third appear deiphobus and helenas the seer in arms with these the mighty asius stood who drew from hyrtacus his noble blood and whom arisba yellow coursers bore
the coursers fed on selle winding shore antenor son the fourth battalion guide and great ćneas born on fountful ide
divine sarpedon the last band obey whom glaucus and asteropaeus aid next him the bravest at their army head but he more brave than all the hosts he led
now with compacted shields in close array the moving legions speed their headlong way already in their hopes they fire the fleet and see the grecians gasping at their feet
while every trojan thus and every aid the advice of wise_nestor polydamas obey asius alone confiding in his car his vaunted coursers urged to meet the war
and advised in vain those wheels returning ne er shall mark the plain no more those coursers with triumphant joy restore their master to the gates of troy
fierce to the left he drives where from the plain the flying grecians strove their ships to gain swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass the gates half open to receive the last
thither exulting in his force he flies his following host with clamours rend the skies to plunge the grecians headlong in the main such their proud hopes but all their hopes were vain
unhappy hero black death attends behind the grecian wall and great idomeneus shall boast thy fall to guard the gates two mighty chiefs attend
as two tall oaks before the wall they rise their roots in earth their heads amidst the skies whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown forbid the tempest and protect the ground high on the hills appears their stately form and their deep roots for ever brave the storm
who from the lapiths warlike race descend this polypoetes great perithous heir and that leonteus like the god of war so graceful these and so the shock they stand of raging asius and his furious band
in vain around them beat their hollow shields the fearless brothers on the grecians call to guard their navies and defend the wall
orestes acamas in front appear and oenomaus and thoon close the rear in vain their clamours shake the ambient fields even when they saw troy sable troops impend and greece tumultuous from her towers descend
so two wild boars spring furious from their den roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men on every side the crackling trees they tear and root the shrubs and lay the forest bare
forth from the portals rush the intrepid pair opposed their breasts and stood themselves the war they gnash their tusks with fire their eye balls roll till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul
around their heads the whistling javelins sung with sounding strokes their brazen targets rung fierce was the fight while yet the grecian powers maintain the walls and mann the lofty towers to save their fleet their last efforts they try and stones and darts in mingled tempests fly
as when sharp boreas blows abroad and brings the dreary winter on his frozen wings beneath the low hung clouds the sheets of snow descend and whiten all the fields below so fast the darts on either army pour so down the rampires rolls the rocky shower heavy and thick resound the batter shields and the deaf echo rattles round the fields
with shame repulsed with grief and fury driven the frantic asius thus accuses heaven in powers immortal who shall now believe
can those too flatter and can which_jove deceive what man could doubt but troy victorious power should humble greece and this her fatal hour
but like when wasps from hollow crannies drive to guard the entrance of their common hive darkening the rock while with unwearied wings
they strike the assailants and infix their stings a race determined that to death contend so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend
these empty accents mingled with the wind nor moved great which_jove unalterable mind to godlike stern_hector and his matchless might was owed the glory of the destined fight
like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried and all the gates sustain an equal tide through the long walls the stony showers were heard
gods shall two warriors only guard their gates repel an army and defraud the fate the blaze of flames the flash of arms appear
while greece unconquer kept alive the war secure of death confiding in despair and all her guardian gods in deep dismay with unassisting arms deplored the day
the spirit of a god my breast inspire to raise each act to life and sing with fire even yet the dauntless lapithae maintain the dreadful pass and round them heap the slain
first damasus by polypoetes steel pierced through his helmet brazen visor fell the weapon drank the mingled brains and gore the warrior sinks tremendous now no more
nor less leonteus strews the field with death first through the belt hippomachus he gored then sudden waved his unresisted sword antiphates as through the ranks he broke the falchion struck and fate pursued the stroke iamenus orestes menon bled and round him rose a monument of dead
meantime the bravest of the trojan crew bold stern_hector and polydamas pursue fierce with impatience on the works to fall and wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall
next ormenus and pylon yield their breath these on the farther bank now stood and gazed by heaven alarm by prodigies amazed
a signal omen stopp the passing host their martial fury in their wonder lost which_jove bird on sounding pinions beat the skies
a bleeding serpent of enormous size his talons truss alive and curling round he stung the bird whose throat received the wound mad with the smart he drops the fatal prey
in airy circle wings his painful way floats on the winds and rends the heaven with cries amidst the host the fallen serpent lies
then first polydamas the silence broke long weigh the signal and to stern_hector spoke how oft my brother thy reproach i bear for word well meant and sentiments sincere
they pale with terror mark its spires unroll and which_jove portent with beating hearts behold true to those counsels which i judge the best i tell the faithful dictates of my breast
in peace in war in council and in fight and all i move deferring to thy sway but tends to raise that power which i obey
seek not this day the grecian ships to gain for sure to warn us which_jove his omen sent and thus my mind explains its clear event
the victor eagle whose sinister flight retards our host and fills our hearts with fright dismiss his conquest in the middle skies allow to seize but not possess the prize
thus though we gird with fires the grecian fleet though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet toils unforeseen and fiercer are decreed more woes shall follow and more heroes bleed
to speak his thought is every freeman right then hear my word nor may my word be vain so bodes my soul and bids me thus advise for thus a skilful seer would read the skies
to him then stern_hector with disdain return fierce as he spoke his eyes with fury burn are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue
thy will is partial not thy reason wrong or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent
what coward counsels would thy madness move against the word the will reveal of which_jove the leading sign the irrevocable nod and happy thunders of the favouring god
these shall i slight and guide my wavering mind by wandering birds that flit with every wind ye vagrants of the sky
your wings extend or where the suns arise or where descend to right to left unheeded take your way while i the dictates of high heaven obey
without a sign his sword the brave man draws and asks no omen but his country cause but why should st thou suspect the war success
none fears it more as none promotes it less though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire
yet should the fears that wary mind suggests spread their cold poison through our soldiers breasts my javelin can revenge so base a part and free the soul that quivers in thy heart
furious he spoke and rushing to the wall calls on his host his host obey the call with ardour follow where their leader flies redoubling clamours thunder in the skies
which_jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of ide and drifts of dust the clouded navy hide he fills the greeks with terror and dismay and gives great stern_hector the predestined day
troy and her son may find a general grave but thou canst live for thou canst be a slave strong in themselves but stronger in his aid close to the works their rigid siege they laid
in vain the mounds and massy beams defend while these they undermine and those they rend upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall and heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall
greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms the crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms shield touching shield a long refulgent row whence hissing darts incessant rain below
the bold ajaces fly from tower to tower and rouse with flame divine the grecian power the generous impulse every greek obeys threats urge the fearful and the valiant praise
fellows in arms whose deeds are known to fame and you whose ardour hopes an equal name since not alike endued with force or art
behold a day when each may act his part a day to fire the brave and warm the cold to gain new glories or augment the old
urge those who stand and those who faint excite drown stern_hector vaunts in loud exhorts of fight conquest not safety fill the thought of all
seek not your fleet but sally from the wall so which_jove once more may drive their routed train and troy lie trembling in her walls again
their ardour kindles all the grecian powers and now the stones descend in heavier showers as when high which_jove his sharp artillery forms and opes his cloudy magazine of storms
in winter bleak un comfortable reign a snowy inundation hides the plain he stills the winds and bids the skies to sleep then pours the silent tempest thick and deep and first the mountain tops are cover o er then the green fields and then the sandy shore
bent with the weight the nodding woods are seen and one bright waste hides all the works of men the circling sea alone absorbing all drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall
so from each side increased the stony rain and the white ruin rise er the plain thus godlike stern_hector and his troops contend to force the ramparts and the gates to rend
nor troy could conquer nor the greeks would yield till great sarpedon tower amid the field for mighty which_jove inspired with martial flame his matchless son and urged him on to fame
in arms he shines conspicuous from afar and bears aloft his ample shield in air within whose orb the thick bull hides were roll ponderous with brass and bound with ductile gold and while two pointed javelins arm his hands majestic moves along and leads his lycian bands
so press with hunger from the mountain brow descends a lion on the flocks below so stalks the lordly savage er the plain
in sullen majesty and stern_hector disdain in vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar and shepherds gall him with an iron war regardless furious he pursues his way he foams he roars he rends the panting prey
he views the towers and meditates their fall to sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall then casting on his friend an ardent look fired with the thirst of glory thus he spoke why boast we glaucus
where xanthus streams enrich the lycian plain our numerous herds that range the fruitful field and hills where vines their purple harvest yield our foaming bowls with
resolved alike divine sarpedon glows with generous rage that drives him on the foes our extended reign purer nectar crown our feasts enhanced with music sprightly sound
why on those shores are we with joy survey admired as heroes and as gods obey unless great acts superior merit prove and vindicate the bounteous powers above
tis ours the dignity they give to grace the first in valour as the first in place that when with wondering eyes our martial bands behold our deeds transcending our commands such they may cry deserve the sovereign state whom those that envy dare not imitate
could all our care elude the gloomy grave which claims no less the fearful and the brave for lust of fame i should not vainly dare in fighting fields nor urge thy soul to war
the life which others pay let us bestow and give to fame what we to nature owe brave though we fall and
but since alas ignoble age must come disease and death inexorable doom honour if we live or let us glory gain or glory give
he said his word the listening chief inspire with equal warmth and rouse the warrior fire the troops pursue their leaders with delight rush to the foe and claim the promised fight
menestheus from on high the storm beheld threatening the fort and blackening in the field around the walls he gazed to view from far what aid appear to avert the approaching war and saw where teucer with the ajaces stood of fight insatiate prodigal of blood
in vain he calls the din of helms and shields rings to the skies and echoes through the fields the brazen hinges fly the walls resound heaven trembles roar the mountain thunders all the ground then thus to thoos hence with speed he said and urge the bold ajaces to our aid their strength united best may help to bear the bloody labours of the doubtful war hither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force
but if too fiercely there the foes contend let ajax_telamon at least our towers defend and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe
swift at the word the herald speeds along the lofty ramparts through the martial throng and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore opposed in combat on the dusty shore
your aid said thoos peteus son demand your strength united best may help to bear the bloody labours of the doubtful war thither the lycian princes bend their course the best and bravest of the hostile force
ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands but if too fiercely here the foes contend at least let ajax_telamon those towers defend
and teucer haste with his unerring bow to share the danger and repel the foe straight to the fort great
oilean_ajax turn his care and thus bespoke his brothers of the war now valiant lycomede exert your might and brave oileus prove your force in fight to you i trust the fortune of the field
till by this arm the foe shall be repell that done expect me to complete the day then with his sevenfold shield he strode away
high on the walls appear the lycian powers like some black tempest gathering round the towers the greeks oppress their utmost force unite prepared to labour in the unequal fight the war renews mix shouts and groans arise tumultuous clamour mounts and thickens in the skies
with equal steps bold teucer press the shore whose fatal bow the strong pandion bore fierce oilean_ajax first the advancing host invades and sends the brave epicles to the shades sarpedon friend
across the warrior way rent from the walls a rocky fragment lay in modern ages not the strongest swain could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain he poised and swung it round then toss on high it flew with force and labour up the sky
as skilful divers from some airy steep headlong descend and shoot into the deep so falls epicles then in groans expires and murmuring to the shades the soul retires
while to the ramparts daring glaucus drew from teucer hand a winged arrow flew the bearded shaft the destined passage found and on his naked arm inflicts a wound
the chief who fear some foe insulting boast might stop the progress of his warlike host conceal the wound and leaping from his height retired reluctant from the unfinish fight
full on the lycian helmet thundering down the ponderous ruin crush his batter crown divine sarpedon with regret beheld disabled glaucus slowly quit the field
alcmaon first was doom his force to feel deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel then from the yawning wound with fury tore the spear pursued by gushing streams of gore
his beating breast with generous ardour glows he springs to fight and flies upon the foes down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound his brazen armour rings against the ground
swift to the battlement the victor flies tugs with full force and every nerve applies it shakes the ponderous stones disjointed yield the rolling ruins smoke along the field
a mighty breach appears the walls lie bare and like a deluge rushes in the war at once bold teucer draws the twanging bow and oilean_ajax sends his javelin at the foe fix in his belt
the feather weapon stood and through his buckler drove the trembling wood but which_jove was present in the dire debate to shield his offspring and avert his fate
the prince gave back not meditating flight but urging vengeance and severer fight then raised with hope and fired with glory charms his fainting squadrons to new fury warms
the breach lies open but your chief in vain attempts alone the guarded pass to gain unite and soon that hostile fleet shall fall the force of powerful union conquers all
where ye lycians is the strength you boast your former fame and ancient virtue lost this just rebuke inflamed the lycian crew they join they thicken and the assault renew
unmoved the embodied greeks their fury dare and fix support the weight of all the war nor could the greeks repel the lycian powers
as on the confines of adjoining grounds two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds they tug they sweat but neither gain nor yield one foot one inch of the contended field thus obstinate to death they fight they fall nor these can keep nor those can win the wall
their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound loud strokes are heard and rattling arms resound the copious slaughter covers all the shore and the high ramparts drip with human gore
as when two scales are charged with doubtful loads from side to side the trembling balance nods while some laborious matron just and poor with nice exactness weighs her woolly store
nor the bold lycians force the grecian towers till poised aloft the resting beam suspends each equal weight nor this nor that descends
so stood the war till stern_hector matchless might with fate prevailing turn the scale of fight fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies and fires his host with loud repeated cries
they hear they run and gathering at his call raise scaling engines and ascend the wall around the works a wood of glittering spears shoots up and all the rising host appears
a ponderous stone bold stern_hector heaved to throw pointed above and rough and gross below not two strong men the enormous weight could raise such men as live in these degenerate days yet this as easy as a swain could bear the snowy fleece he toss and shook in air for which_jove upheld and lighten of its load the unwieldy rock the labour of a god
thus arm before the folded gates he came of massy substance and stupendous frame with iron bars and brazen hinges strong on lofty beams of solid timber hung
then thundering through the planks with forceful sway drives the sharp rock the solid beams give way the folds are shatter from the crackling door leap the resounding bars the flying hinges roar
advance ye trojans lend your valiant hands haste to the fleet and toss the blazing brands now rushing in the furious chief appears gloomy as night
and shakes two shining spears a dreadful gleam from his bright armour came and from his eye balls flash the living flame
then pouring after through the gaping space a tide of trojans flows and fills the place the greeks behold they tremble and they fly the shore is heap with death and tumult rends the sky
he moves a god resistless in his course and seems a match for more than mortal force illustration greek altar greek altar
neptune concerned for the loss of the grecians upon seeing the fortification forced by stern_hector who had entered the gate near the station of the ajaces assumes the shape of calchas and inspires those heroes to oppose him then in the form of one of the generals encourages the other greeks who had retired to their vessels
book xiii argument the fourth battle continued in which neptune assists the greeks the acts of idomeneus the ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx and put a stop to stern_hector and the trojans
several deeds of valour are performed meriones losing his spear in the encounter repairs to seek another at the tent of idomeneus this occasions a conversation between those two warriors who return together to the battle
idomeneus signalizes his courage above the rest he kills othryoneus asius and alcathous deiphobus and ćneas march against him and at length idomeneus retires
the trojans are repulsed on the left wing stern_hector still keeps his ground against the ajaces till being galled by the locrian slingers and archers polydamas advises to call a council of war stern_hector approves of his advice but goes first to rally the trojans upbraids paris rejoins polydamas meets oilean_ajax again and renews the attack
great_menelaus wounds helenus and kills pisander the eight and twentieth day still continues the scene is between the grecian wall and the sea shore
when now the thunderer on the sea beat coast had fix great stern_hector and his conquering host he left them to the fate in bloody fray to toil and struggle through the well fought day
to where the mysians prove their martial force and hardy thracians tame the savage horse and where the far famed hippomolgian strays renown for justice and for length of days
that innocent of blood from milk innoxious seek their simple food which_jove sees delighted and avoids the scene of guilty troy of arms and dying men
then turn to thracia from the field of fight those eyes that shed insufferable light thrice happy race no aid he deems to either host is given while his high law suspends the powers of heaven
in samothracia on a mountain brow whose waving woods erhung the deeps below he sat and round him cast his azure eyes where ida misty tops confusedly rise below fair ilion glittering spires were seen the crowded ships and sable sea between
meantime the monarch of the watery main observed the thunderer nor observed in vain there from the crystal chambers of the main emerged he sat and mourn his argives slain
fierce as he pass the lofty mountain nod the forest shakes earth trembled as he trod and felt the footsteps of the immortal god
at which_jove incensed with grief and fury stung prone down the rocky steep he rush along from realm to realm three ample strides he took
far in the bay his shining palace stands eternal frame not raised by mortal hands this having reach his brass hoof steeds he reins fleet as the winds and deck with golden manes
he mounts the car the golden scourge applies he sits superior and the chariot flies his whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep the enormous monsters rolling er the deep gambol around him on the watery way and heavy whales in awkward measures play the sea subsiding spreads a level plain exults and owns the monarch of the main the parting waves before his coursers fly the wondering waters leave his axle dry
deep in the liquid regions lies a cave between where tenedos the surges lave and rocky imbrus breaks the rolling wave there the great ruler of the azure round stopp his swift chariot and his steeds unbound fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand
and at the fourth the distant ćgae shook refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold immortal arms of adamant and gold and link their fetlocks with a golden band infrangible immortal there they stay
the father of the floods pursues his way where like a tempest darkening heaven around or fiery deluge that devours the ground the impatient trojans in a gloomy throng embattled roll as stern_hector rush along to the loud tumult and the barbarous cry the heavens re echo and the shores reply they vow destruction to the grecian name and in their hopes the fleets already flame
but neptune rising from the sea profound the god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground now wears a mortal form like calchas seen such his loud voice and such his manly mien his shouts incessant every greek inspire but
most the ajaces adding fire to fire illustration neptune rising from the sea neptune rising from the sea tis yours warriors all our hopes to raise oh recollect your ancient worth and praise
tis yours to save us if you cease to fear flight more than shameful is destructive here on other works though troy with fury fall
and pour her armies er our batter wall there greece has strength but this this part erthrown her strength were vain i dread for you alone
here stern_hector rages like the force of fire vaunts of his gods and calls high which_jove his sire if yet some heavenly power your breast excite breathe in your hearts and string your arms to fight greece yet may live her threaten fleet maintain
then with his sceptre that the deep controls he touch the chiefs and steel their manly souls strength not their own the touch divine imparts prompts their light limbs and swells their daring hearts
then as a falcon from the rocky height her quarry seen impetuous at the sight forth springing instant darts herself from high shoots on the wing and skims along the sky
and stern_hector force and which_jove own aid be vain such and so swift the power of ocean flew the wide horizon shut him from their view
the inspiring god oileus active son perceived the first and thus to ajax_telamon some god my friend some god in human form favouring descends and wills to stand the storm
not calchas this the venerable seer short as he turned i saw the power appear i mark his parting and the steps he trod his own bright evidence reveals a god
even now some energy divine i share and seem to walk on wings and tread in air with equal ardour ajax_telamon returns
my soul is kindled and my bosom burns new rising spirits all my force alarm lift each impatient limb and brace my arm
this ready arm unthinking shakes the dart the blood pours back and fortifies my heart singly methinks yon towering chief i meet and stretch the dreadful stern_hector at my feet
full of the god that urged their burning breast the heroes thus their mutual warmth express neptune meanwhile the routed greeks inspired
who breathless pale with length of labours tired pant in the ships while troy to conquest calls and swarms victorious er their yielding walls
trembling before the impending storm they lie while tears of rage stand burning in their eye greece sunk they thought and this their fatal hour but breathe new courage as they feel the power
then stern_hector peneleus rise to the fight thoas deipyrus in arms renown and merion next the impulsive fury found last wise_nestor son the same bold ardour takes
teucer and leitus first his word excite while thus the god the martial fire awakes oh lasting infamy oh dire disgrace to chiefs of vigorous youth and manly race
i trusted in the gods and you to see brave greece victorious and her navy free ah no the glorious combat you disclaim and one black day clouds all her former fame
heavens what a prodigy these eyes survey unseen unthought till this amazing day fly we at length from troy oft conquer bands
and falls our fleet by such inglorious hands a rout undisciplined a straggling train not born to glories of the dusty plain
like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued a prey to every savage of the wood shall these so late who trembled at your name invade your camps involve your ships in flame
a change so shameful say what cause has wrought the soldiers baseness or the general fault fools will ye perish for your leader vice the purchase infamy and life the price
tis not your cause achilles injured fame another is the crime but yours the shame grant that our chief offend through rage or lust must you be cowards if your king unjust
prevent this evil and your country save small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave think and subdue on dastards dead to fame i waste no anger for they feel no shame
but you the pride the flower of all our host my heart weeps blood to see your glory lost nor deem this day this battle all you lose a day more black a fate more vile ensues
let each reflect who prizes fame or breath on endless infamy on instant death for lo the fated time the appointed shore hark
the gates burst the brazen barriers roar impetuous stern_hector thunders at the wall the hour the spot to conquer or to fall
these word the grecians fainting hearts inspire and listening armies catch the godlike fire fix at his post was each bold
so close their order so disposed their fight as pallas self might view with fix delight or had the god of war inclined his eyes the god of war had own a just surprise
oilean_ajax found with well ranged squadrons strongly circled round a chosen phalanx firm resolved as fate descending stern_hector and his battle wait
an iron scene gleams dreadful er the fields armour in armour lock and shields in shields spears lean on spears on targets targets throng helms stuck to helms and man drove man along
as when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove and levell at the skies with pointing rays their brandish lances at each motion blaze
thus breathing death in terrible array the close compacted legions urged their way fierce they drove on impatient to destroy troy charged the first and stern_hector first of troy
as from some mountain craggy forehead torn a rock round fragment flies with fury borne which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends precipitate the ponderous mass descends
from steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds at every shock the crackling wood resounds still gathering force it smokes and urged amain whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain there stops so stern_hector
on him the war is bent the darts are shed and all their falchions wave around his head repulsed he stands nor from his stand retires but with repeated shouts his army fires
the floating plumes unnumber wave above their whole force he proved resistless when he raged and when he stopp unmoved
trojans be firm this arm shall make your way through yon square body and that black array stand and my spear shall rout their scattering power
strong as they seem embattled like a tower for he that juno heavenly bosom warms the first of gods this day inspires our arms
he said and roused the soul in every breast urged with desire of fame beyond the rest forth march deiphobus but marching held before his wary steps his ample shield
the glittering javelin pierced the tough bull hide but pierced not through unfaithful to his hand the point broke short and sparkled in the sand
bold merion aim a stroke nor aim it wide the trojan warrior touch with timely fear on the raised orb to distance bore the spear
the greek retreating mourn his frustrate blow and cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe then to the ships with surly speed he went to seek a surer javelin in his tent
meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows the tumult thickens and the clamour grows by teucer arm the warlike imbrius bleeds the son of mentor rich in generous steeds
ere yet to troy the son of greece were led in fair pedaeus verdant pastures bred the youth had dwelt remote from war alarms and blest in bright medesicaste arms
this nymph the fruit of priam ravish joy allied the warrior to the house of troy to troy when glory call his arms he came and match the bravest of her chiefs in fame
with priam son a guardian of the throne he lived beloved and honour as his own him teucer pierced between the throat and ear he groans beneath the telamonian spear
as from some far seen mountain airy crown subdued by steel a tall ash tumbles down and soils its verdant tresses on the ground so falls the youth his arms the fall resound
then teucer rushing to despoil the dead from stern_hector hand a shining javelin fled he saw and shunn the death the forceful dart sung on and pierced amphimachus heart cteatus son of neptune forceful line vain was his courage and his race divine
to seize his beamy helm the victor flies and just had fastened on the dazzling prize when oilean_ajax manly arm a javelin flung full on the shield round boss the weapon rung he felt the shock nor more was doom to feel secure in mail and sheath in shining steel
prostrate he falls his clanging arms resound and his broad buckler thunders on the ground repulsed he yields the victor greeks obtain the spoil contested and bear off the slain
between the leaders of the athenian line stichius the brave menestheus the divine deplored amphimachus sad object lies imbrius remains the fierce ajaces prize
in their fell jaws high lifting through the wood and sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood so these the chief great oilean_ajax from the dead strips his bright arms oileus lops his head toss like a ball and whirl in air away at stern_hector feet the gory visage lay
the god of ocean fired with stern_hector disdain and pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain inspires the grecian hearts confirms their hands and breathes destruction on the trojan bands
swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet he finds the lance famed idomen of crete his pensive brow the generous care
with which a wounded soldier touch his breast whom in the chance of war a javelin tore and his sad comrades from the battle bore him to the surgeons of the camp he sent that office paid he issued from his tent fierce for the fight to whom the god begun in thoas voice
as two grim lions bear across the lawn snatch from devouring hounds a slaughter fawn express andraemon valiant son who ruled where calydon white rocks arise and pleuron chalky cliffs emblaze the skies
where now the imperious vaunt the daring boast of greece victorious and proud ilion lost to whom the king on greece no blame be thrown arms are her trade and war is all her own
her hardy heroes from the well fought plains nor fear withholds nor shameful sloth detains tis heaven alas and which_jove all powerful doom that far far distant from our native home
once foremost in the fight still prone to lend or arms or counsels now perform thy best and what thou canst not singly urge the rest
wills us to fall inglorious oh my friend thus he and thus the god whose force can make the solid globe eternal basis shake
ah never may he see his native land but feed the vultures on this hateful strand who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay nor dares to combat on this signal day
together let us battle on the plain two not the worst nor even this succour vain not vain the weakest if their force unite
for this behold in horrid arms i shine and urge thy soul to rival acts with mine but ours the bravest have confess in fight
this said he rushes where the combat burns swift to his tent the cretan king returns from thence two javelins glittering in his hand and clad in arms that lighten all the strand fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove like lightning bursting from the arm of which_jove which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares or terrifies the offending world with wars in streamy sparkles kindling all the skies from pole to pole the trail of glory flies
thus his bright armour er the dazzled throng gleam dreadful as the monarch flash along him near his tent meriones attends
whom thus he questions ever best of friends say in every art of battle skill what holds thy courage from so brave a field
on some important message art thou bound or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound inglorious here my soul abhors to stay and glows with prospects of th approaching day
meriones replies whose care leads forth the embattled son of crete to war this speaks my grief this headless lance i wield the rest lies rooted in a trojan shield
to whom the cretan enter and receive the wonted weapons those my tent can give spears i have store and trojan lances all
prince that shed a lustre round the illumined wall though i disdainful of the distant war nor trust the dart nor aim the uncertain spear
yet hand to hand i fight and spoil the slain and thence these trophies and these arms i gain enter and see on heaps the helmets roll
and high hung spears and shields that flame with gold nor vain said merion are our martial toils we too can boast of no ignoble spoil
but those my ship contains whence distant far i fight conspicuous in the van of war what need i more if any greek there be
who knows not merion i appeal to thee to this idomeneus the fields of fight have proved thy valour and unconquer might
and were some ambush for the foes design even there thy courage would not lag behind in that sharp service singled from the rest the fear of each or valour stands confess
he shifts his place his colour comes and goes a dropping sweat creeps cold on every part against his bosom beats his quivering heart terror and death in his wild eye balls stare with chattering teeth he stands and stiffening hair and looks a bloodless image of despair
no force no firmness the pale coward shows not so the brave still dauntless still the same unchanged his colour and unmoved his frame
composed his thought determined is his eye and fix his soul to conquer or to die if aught disturb the tenour of his breast tis but the wish to strike before the rest
by chance of fight whatever wounds you bore those wounds were glorious all and all before such as may teach twas still thy brave delight
in such assays thy blameless worth is known and every art of dangerous war thy ownt oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight
but why like infant cold to honour charms stand we to talk when glory calls to arms go from my conquer spears the choicest take
and to their owners send them nobly back swift at the word bold merion snatch a spear and breathing slaughter follow to the war
so mars armipotent invades the plain the wide destroyer of the race of man terror his best beloved son attends his course arm with stern_hector boldness and enormous force the pride of haughty warriors to confound and lay the strength of tyrants on the ground from thrace they fly call to the dire alarms of warring phlegyans and ephyrian arms invoked by both relentless they dispose to these glad conquest murderous rout to those
so march the leaders of the cretan train and their bright arms shot horror er the plain then first spake merion
shall we join the right or combat in the centre of the fight or to the left our wonted succour lend
our ablest chieftains the main battle guide each godlike oilean_ajax makes that post his care and gallant teucer deals destruction there skill or with shafts to gall the distant field or bear close battle on the sounding shield
hazard and fame all parts alike attend not in the centre idomen replied these can the rage of haughty stern_hector tame safe in their arms the navy fears no flame
till which_jove himself descends his bolts to shed and hurl the blazing ruin at our head great must he be of more than human birth nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth
him neither rocks can crush nor steel can wound whom oilean_ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground in standing fight he mates achilles force excell alone in swiftness in the course
then to the left our ready arms apply and live with glory or with glory die he said and merion to th appointed place fierce as the god of battles urged his pace
soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld rush like a fiery torrent er the field their force embodied in a tide they pour the rising combat sounds along the shore
as warring winds in sirius sultry reign from different quarters sweep the sandy plain on every side the dusty whirlwinds rise and the dry fields are lifted to the skies
thus by despair hope rage together driven met the black hosts and meeting darken heaven all dreadful glared the iron face of war bristled with upright spears that
flash afar dire was the gleam of breastplates helms and shields and polish arms emblazed the flaming fields tremendous scene that general horror gave but touch with joy
the bosoms of the brave saturn great son in fierce contention vied and crowds of heroes in their anger died the sire of earth and heaven by thetis won to crown with glory
while neptune rising from his azure main warr on the king of heaven with stern_hector disdain and breathed revenge and fired the grecian train
gods of one source of one ethereal race alike divine and heaven their native place but which_jove the greater first born of the skies and more than men or gods supremely wise_nestor
peleus godlike son will not destruction to the grecian powers but spared awhile the destined trojan towers for this of which_jove superior might afraid neptune in human form conceal his aid
these powers enfold the greek and trojan train in war and discord adamantine chain indissolubly strong the fatal tie is stretch on both and close compell they die
first by his hand othryoneus was slain swell with false hopes with mad ambition vain call by the voice of war to martial fame from high cabesus distant walls he came cassandra love he sought with boasts of power and promised conquest was the proffer dower
dreadful in arms and grown in combats grey the bold idomeneus controls the day the king consented by his vaunts abused the king consented but the fate refused
proud of himself and of the imagined bride the field he measured with a larger stride him as he stalk the cretan javelin found vain was his breastplate to repel the wound
his dream of glory lost he plunged to hell his arms resounded as the boaster fell the great idomeneus bestrides the dead and thus he cries behold thy promise sped
such is the help thy arms to ilion bring and such the contract of the phrygian king our offers now illustrious prince receive for such an aid what will not argos give
meantime on further methods to advise come follow to the fleet thy new allies there hear what greece has on her part to say
to conquer troy with ours thy forces join and count atrides fairest daughter thine he spoke and dragg the gory corse away
this asius view unable to contain before his chariot warring on the plain his crowded coursers to his squire consign impatient panted on his neck behind
to vengeance rising with a sudden spring he hoped the conquest of the cretan king the wary cretan as his foe drew near full on his throat discharged the forceful spear
as when the mountain oak or poplar tall or pine fit mast for some great admiral groans to the oft heaved axe with many a wound then spreads a length of ruin er the ground so sunk proud asius in that dreadful day and stretch before his much loved coursers lay
beneath the chin the point was seen to glide and glitter extant at the further side he grinds the dust distain with streaming gore and fierce in death lies foaming on the shore
deprived of motion stiff with stupid fear stands all aghast his trembling charioteer nor shuns the foe nor turns the steeds away but falls
transfix an unresisting prey pierced by antilochus he pants beneath the stately car and labours out his breath thus asius steeds their mighty master gone
remain the prize of wise_nestor youthful son stabb at the sight deiphobus drew nigh and made with force the vengeful weapon fly
beneath the spacious targe a blazing round thick with bull hides and brazen orbits bound on his raised arm by two strong braces stay
the cretan saw and stooping caused to glance from his slope shield the disappointed lance he lay collected in defensive shade
even then the spear the vigorous arm confess and pierced obliquely king hypsenor breast warm in his liver to the ground it bore the chief his people guardian now no more
o er his safe head the javelin idly sung and on the tinkling verge more faintly rung not unattended the proud trojan cries
nor unrevenged lamented asius lies for thee through hell black portals stand display this mate shall joy thy melancholy shade
heart piercing anguish at the haughty boast touch every greek but wise_nestor son the most grieved as he was his pious arms attend and his broad buckler shields his slaughter friend
nor yet from fight idomeneus withdraws resolved to perish in his country cause or find some foe whom heaven and he shall doom to wail his fate in death eternal gloom
he sees alcathous in the front aspire great ćsyetes was the hero sire his spouse hippodame divinely fair anchises eldest hope and darling care who charm her parents and her husband heart with beauty sense and every work of art he once of ilion youth the loveliest boy the fairest she of all the fair of troy
who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes and fetters every limb yet bent to meet his fate he stands nor shuns the lance of crete
till sad mecistheus and alastor bore his honour body to the tented shore by neptune now the hapless hero dies fix as some column or deep rooted oak
while the winds sleep his breast received the stroke before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields long used to ward the death in fighting fields
the riven armour sends a jarring sound his labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound the long lance shakes and vibrates in the wound fast flowing from its source as prone he lay life purple tide impetuous gush away
then idomen insulting er the slain behold deiphobus nor vaunt in vain see on one greek three trojan ghosts attend
this my third victim to the shades i send approaching now thy boasted might approve and try the prowess of the seed of which_jove
enamour of a mortal dame great minos guardian of his country came deucalion blameless prince was minos heir his first born i the third from jupiter er spacious crete and her bold son i reign and thence my ships transport me through the main lord of a host er all my host i shine a scourge to thee thy father and thy line
the trojan heard uncertain or to meet alone with venturous arms the king of crete or seek auxiliar force at length decreed to call some hero to partake the deed forthwith ćneas rise to his thought
for him in troy remotest lines he sought where he incensed at partial priam stands and sees superior posts in meaner hands
to him ambitious of so great an aid the bold deiphobus approach and said now trojan prince employ thy pious arms if er thy bosom felt fair honour charms
from which_jove alcathous dies thy brother and thy friend come and the warrior loved remains defend beneath his cares thy early youth was train one table fed you and one roof contain
ćneas heard and for a space resign to tender pity all his manly mind then rising in his rage he burns to fight
this deed to fierce idomeneus we owe haste and revenge it on th insulting foe the greek awaits him with collected might
as the fell boar on some rough mountain head arm with wild terrors and to slaughter bred when the loud rustics rise and shout from far attends the tumult and expects the war er his bent back the bristly horrors rise fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes
his foaming tusks both dogs and men engage but most his hunters rouse his mighty rage so stood idomeneus his javelin shook and met the trojan with a lowering look
the youthful offspring of the god of war merion and aphareus in field renown to these the warrior sent his voice around
antilochus deipyrus were near fellows in arms your timely aid unite lo great ćneas rushes to the fight sprung from a god and more than mortal bold
he fresh in youth and i in arms grown old else should this hand this hour decide the strife the great dispute of glory or of life
ćneas too demand th assisting forces of his native bands paris deiphobus agenor join co aids and captains of the trojan line
in order follow all th embodied train like ida flocks proceeding er the plain before his fleecy care erect and bold stalks the proud ram the father of the bold
he spoke and all as with one soul obey their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade around the chief with joy the swain surveys them as he leads to the cool fountains through the well known meads
round dread alcathous now the battle rose on every side the steely circle grows now batter breast plates and hack helmets ring
so joys ćneas as his native band moves on in rank and stretches er the land and er their heads unheeded javelins sing
above the rest two towering chiefs appear there great idomeneus ćneas here like gods of war dispensing fate they stood and burn to drench the ground with mutual blood
whizz along in air the cretan saw and shunn the brazen spear sent from an arm so strong the missive wood
the forceful spear his hollow corslet broke it ripp his belly with a ghastly wound and roll the smoking entrails on the ground
the trojan weapon stuck deep in earth and quiver where it stood but oenomas received the cretan stroke stretch on the plain he sobs away his breath
and furious grasps the bloody dust in death the victor from his breast the weapon tears his spoil he could not for the shower of spears
though now unfit an active war to wage heavy with cumbrous arms stiff with cold age his listless limbs unable for the course in standing fight he yet maintains his force till faint with labour and by foes repell
deiphobus beheld him as he pass and fired with hate a parting javelin cast the javelin err but held its course along and pierced ascalaphus the brave and young
his tired slow steps he drags from off the field the son of mars fell gasping on the ground and gnash the dust all bloody with his wound
nor knew the furious father of his fall high throned amidst the great olympian hall on golden clouds th immortal synod sate detain from bloody war by which_jove and fate
for slain ascalaphus commenced the fray deiphobus to seize his helmet flies and from his temples rends the glittering prize valiant as mars meriones drew near
and on his loaded arm discharged his spear he drops the weight disabled with the pain the hollow helmet rings against the plain
swift as a vulture leaping on his prey from his torn arm the grecian rent away the reeking javelin and rejoin his friends
good polites tends around his waist his pious arms he threw and from the rage of battle gently drew him his swift coursers on his splendid car rapt from the lessening thunder of the war to troy they drove him groaning from the shore and sprinkling as he pass the sands with gore
now where in dust the breathless hero lay his wounded brother meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground heaps fall on heaps and heaven and earth resound
bold aphareus by great ćneas bled as toward the chief he turn his daring head he pierced his throat the bending head depress beneath his helmet nods upon his breast his shield reversed er the fallen warrior lies and everlasting slumber seals his eyes
antilochus as thoon turn him round transpierced his back with a dishonest wound the hollow vein that to the neck extends along the chine his eager javelin rends
th exulting victor leaping where he lay from his broad shoulders tore the spoil away his time observed for closed by foes around on all sides thick the peals of arms resound
supine he falls and to his social train spreads his imploring arms but spreads in vain his shield emboss the ringing storm sustains but he impervious and untouch remains
in arms intrepid with the first he fought faced every foe and every danger sought his winged lance resistless as the wind obeys each motion of the master mind
great neptune care preserved from hostile rage this youth the joy of wise_nestor glorious age restless it flies impatient to be free and meditates the distant enemy
the son of asius adamas drew near and struck his target with the brazen spear fierce in his front but neptune wards the blow and blunts the javelin of th eluded foe
in the broad buckler half the weapon stood splinter on earth flew half the broken wood disarm he mingled in the trojan crew but merion spear ertook him as he flew
deep in the belly rim an entrance found where sharp the pang and mortal is the wound bending he fell and doubled to the ground lay panting
thus an ox in fetters tied while death strong pangs distend his labouring side his bulk enormous on the field displays his heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays
next brave deipyrus in dust was laid king helenus waved high the thracian blade and smote his temples with an arm so strong the helm fell off and roll amid the throng
the spear the conqueror from his body drew and death dim shadows swarm before his view there for some luckier greek it rests a prize for dark in death the godlike owner lies
raging with grief great_menelaus burns and fraught with vengeance to the victor turns that shook the ponderous lance in act to throw and this stood adverse with the bended bow
full on his breast the trojan arrow fell but harmless bounded from the plated steel as on some ample barn well harden floor the winds collected at each open door
while the broad fan with force is whirl around light leaps the golden grain resulting from the ground so from the steel that guards atrides heart repell to distance flies the bounding dart
atrides watchful of the unwary foe pierced with his lance the hand that grasp the bow and nailed it to the yew
the wounded hand trail the long lance that mark with blood the sand but good agenor gently from the wound the spear solicits and the bandage bound a sling soft wool
snatch from a soldier side at once the tent and ligature supplied behold pisander urged by fate decree springs through the ranks to fall and fall by thee great_menelaus
to enchance thy fame high towering in the front the warrior came first the sharp lance was by atrides thrown the lance far distant by the winds was blown
not so discouraged to the future blind vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind dauntless he rushes where the spartan lord like lightning brandish his far beaming sword
nor pierced pisander through atrides shield pisander spear fell shiver on the field his left arm high opposed the shining shield
his right beneath the cover pole axe held an olive cloudy grain the handle made distinct with studs and brazen was the blade
this on the helm discharged a noble blow the plume dropp nodding to the plain below shorn from the crest atrides waved his steel
deep through his front the weighty falchion fell the crashing bones before its force gave way in dust and blood the groaning hero lay
and fierce atrides spurn him as he bled tore off his arms and loud exulting said thus trojans thus at length be taught to fear race perfidious who delight in war
forced from their ghastly orbs and spouting gore the clotted eye balls tumble on the shore already noble deeds ye have perform a princess raped transcends a navy storm
the violated rites the ravish dame our heroes slaughter and our ships on flame crimes heap on crimes shall bend your glory down and whelm in ruins yon flagitious town
in such bold feats your impious might approve without th assistance or the fear of which_jove thou great father lord of earth and skies
above the thought of man supremely wise_nestor if from thy hand the fate of mortals flow from whence this favour to an impious foe
the best of things beyond their measure cloy sleep balmy blessing love endearing joy the feast the dance whate er mankind desire even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire
a godless crew abandon and unjust still breathing rapine violence and lust but troy for ever reaps a dire delight in thirst of slaughter and in lust of fight
the bloody armour which his train received then sudden mix among the warring crew and the bold son of pylaemenes slew
following his martial father to the war through filial love he left his native shore never ah never to behold it more
his unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling against the target of the spartan king thus of his lance disarm from death he flies and turns around his apprehensive eyes
this said he seized while yet the carcase heaved harpalion had through asia travell far him through the hip transpiercing as he fled the shaft of merion mingled with the dead
beneath the bone the glancing point descends and driving down the swelling bladder rends sunk in his sad companions arms he lay and
in short pantings sobb his soul away like some vile worm extended on the ground while life red torrent gush from out the wound
him on his car the paphlagonian train in slow procession bore from off the plain the pensive father father now no more
attends the mournful pomp along the shore and unavailing tears profusely shed and unrevenged deplored his offspring dead paris from far the moving sight beheld
with pity soften and with fury swell his honour host a youth of matchless grace and loved of all the paphlagonian race
with his full strength he bent his angry bow and wing the feather vengeance at the foe a chief there was the brave euchenor named for riches much and more for virtue famed
who held his seat in corinth stately town polydus son a seer of old renown oft had the father told his early doom by arms abroad or slow disease at home
beneath his ear the pointed arrow went the soul came issuing at the narrow vent his limbs unnerved drop useless on the ground and everlasting darkness shades him round
he climb his vessel prodigal of breath and chose the certain glorious path to death nor knew great stern_hector how his legions yield
wide on the left the force of greece commands and conquest hovers er th achaian bands with such a tide superior virtue sway and he that shakes the solid earth gave aid
wrapp in the cloud and tumult of the field but in the centre stern_hector fix remain where first the gates were forced and bulwarks gain
and where low walls confine the beating tides whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides where late in fight both foot and horse engaged and all the thunder of the battle raged there join the whole boeotian strength remains
the proud iaonians with their sweeping train locrians and phthians and th epaean force but join repel not stern_hector fiery course
the flower of athens stichius phidas led bias and great menestheus at their head meges the strong the epaean bands controll and dracius prudent and amphion bold the phthians medon famed for martial might and brave podarces active in the fight
there on the margin of the hoary deep their naval station where the ajaces keep this drew from phylacus his noble line
iphiclus son and that oileus thine young oilean_ajax brother by a stolen embrace he dwelt far distant from his native place
by his fierce step dame from his father reign expell and exiled for her brother slain these rule the phthians and their arms employ mix with boeotians on the shores of troy
now side by side with like unwearied care each oilean_ajax laboured through the field of war so when two lordly bulls with equal toil force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil join to one yoke the stubborn earth they tear and trace large furrows with the shining share er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow and streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow
a train of heroes followed through the field who bore by turns great oilean_ajax sevenfold shield whene er he breathed remissive of his might tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight
no following troops his brave associate grace in close engagement an unpractised race the locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield nor bear the helm nor lift the moony shield but skill from far the flying shaft to wing or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling dexterous with these
thus in the van the telamonian train throng in bright arms a pressing fight maintain far in the rear the locrian archers lie whose stones and arrows intercept the sky the mingled tempest on the foes they pour troy scattering orders open to the shower
now had the greeks eternal fame acquired and the gall ilians to their walls retired but sage polydamas discreetly brave address great stern_hector and this counsel gave though great in all thou seem st averse to lend impartial audience to a faithful friend to gods and men thy matchless worth is known
they aim a certain wound or fell the distant warrior to the ground and every art of glorious war thy own
but in cool thought and counsel to excel how widely differs this from warring well content with what the bounteous gods have given seek not alone to engross the gifts of heaven
to some the powers of bloody war belong to some sweet music and the charm of song to few and wondrous few has which_jove assign d
a wise_nestor extensive all considering mind their guardians these the nations round confess and towns and empires for their safety bless if heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast attend stern_hector
what i judge the best see as thou mov st on dangers dangers spread and war whole fury burns around thy head
behold distress within yon hostile wall how many trojans yield disperse or fall what troops out number scarce the war maintain and what brave heroes at the ships lie slain
here cease thy fury and the chiefs and kings convoked to council weigh the sum of things whether the gods succeeding our desires
to yon tall ships to bear the trojan fires or quit the fleet and pass unhurt away contented with the conquest of the day
i fear i fear lest greece not yet undone pay the large debt of last revolving sun achilles great achilles yet remains on yonder decks and yet erlooks the plains
the counsel pleased and stern_hector with a bound leap from his chariot on the trembling ground swift as he leap his clanging arms resound
to guard this post he cried thy art employ and here detain the scatter youth of troy where yonder heroes faint i bend my way and hasten back to end the doubtful day
this said the towering chief prepares to go shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow and seems a moving mountain topp with snow
to panthus son at stern_hector high command haste the bold leaders of the trojan band but round the battlements and round the plain for many a chief he look but look in vain deiphobus nor helenus the seer nor asius son nor asius self appear for these were pierced with many a ghastly wound
some cold in death some groaning on the ground some low in dust a mournful object lay high on the wall some breathed their souls away
through all his host inspiring force he flies and bids anew the martial thunder rise far on the left amid the throng he found cheering the troops and dealing deaths around
the graceful paris whom with fury moved opprobrious thus th impatient chief reproved ill fated paris slave to womankind as smooth of face as fraudulent of mind
where is deiphobus where asius gone the godlike father and th intrepid son the force of helenus dispensing fate and great othryoneus so fear of late
black fate hang o er thee from th avenging gods imperial troy from her foundations nods whelm in thy country ruin shalt thou fall and one devouring vengeance swallow all
when paris thus my brother and my friend thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend in other battles i deserved thy blame though then not deedless nor unknown to fame
the chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain of all those heroes two alone remain deiphobus and helenus the seer
but since yon rampart by thy arms lay low i scatter slaughter from my fatal bow each now disabled by a hostile spear
go then successful where thy soul inspires this heart and hand shall second all thy fires what with this arm i can prepare to know
till death for death be paid and blow for blow but tis not ours with forces not our own to combat strength is of the gods alone
around polydamas distain with blood cebrion phalces stern_hector orthaeus stood palmus with polypoetes the divine and two bold brothers of hippotion line who reach fair ilion from ascania far the former day the next engaged in war
as when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs that bears which_jove thunder on its dreadful wings wide er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps then gather settles on the hoary deeps the afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar the waves behind impel the waves before wide rolling foaming high and tumbling to the shore
these word the hero angry mind assuage then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage thus rank on rank the thick battalions throng chief urged on chief and man drove man along
far er the plains in dreadful order bright the brazen arms reflect a beamy light full in the blazing van great stern_hector shined like mars commission to confound mankind
before him flaming his enormous shield like the broad sun illumined all the field his nodding helm emits a streamy ray his piercing eyes through all the battle stray and while beneath his targe he flash along shot terrors round that
wither e en the strong thus stalk he dreadful death was in his look whole nations fear but not an argive shook
the towering oilean_ajax with an ample stride advanced the first and thus the chief defied stern_hector come on thy empty threats forbear
tis not thy arm tis thundering which_jove we fear the skill of war to us not idly given lo greece is humbled not by troy but
heaven vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts to force our fleet the greeks have hands and hearts long ere in flames our lofty navy fall
your boasted city and your god built wall shall sink beneath us smoking on the ground and spread a long unmeasured ruin round
the time shall come when chased along the plain even thou shalt call on which_jove and call in vain even thou shalt wish to aid thy desperate course the wings of falcons for thy flying horse shalt run forgetful of a warrior fame while clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame
to which_jove glad omen all the grecians rise and hail with shouts his progress through the skies far echoing clamours bound from side to side they ceased and thus the chief of troy replied from whence this menace this insulting strain
as thus he spoke behold in open view on sounding wings a dexter eagle flew enormous boaster doom to vaunt in vain
so may the gods on stern_hector life bestow not that short life which mortals lead below but such as those of which_jove high lineage born the blue eyed maid or he that gilds the morn as this decisive day shall end the fame of greece and argos be no more a name
the lance of stern_hector thou shalt meet thy fate that giant corse extended on the shore shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore
he said and like a lion stalk along with shouts incessant earth and ocean rung sent from his following host the grecian train with answering thunders fill the echoing plain a shout that tore heaven concave and above shook the fix splendours of the throne of which_jove
and thou imperious if thy madness wait illustration greek earrings greek earrings book xiv argument juno deceives jupiter by the girdle of venus
wise_nestor sitting at the table with machaon is alarmed with the increasing clamour of war and hastens to agamemnon on his way he meets that prince with diomed and ulysses whom he informs of the extremity of the danger
agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night which ulysses withstands to which diomed adds his advice that wounded as they were they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence which advice is pursued
juno seeing the partiality of jupiter to the trojans forms a design to over reach him she sets off her charms with the utmost care and the more surely to enchant him obtains the magic girdle of venus
she then applies herself to the god of sleep and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eyes of jupiter
this done she goes to mount ida where the god at first sight is ravished with her beauty sinks in her embraces and is laid asleep
stern_hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by oilean_ajax and carried off from the battle several actions succeed till the trojans much distressed are obliged to give way the lesser oilean_ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner
but not the genial feast nor flowing bowl could charm the cares of wise_nestor watchful soul his startled ears the increasing cries attend then thus impatient to his wounded friend what new alarm divine machaon say what mix events attend this mighty day
neptune takes advantage of his slumber and succours the greeks hark how the shouts divide and how they meet and now come full and thicken to the fleet
here with the cordial draught dispel thy care let hecamede the strengthening bath prepare refresh thy wound and cleanse the clotted gore while i the adventures of the day explore
he said and seizing thrasymedes shield his valiant offspring hasten to the field that day the son his father buckler bore
then snatch a lance and issued from the door soon as the prospect open to his view his wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew dire disarray
the tumult of the fight the wall in ruins and the greeks in flight as when old ocean silent surface sleeps the waves just heaving on the purple deeps
while yet the expected tempest hangs on high weighs down the cloud and blackens in the sky the mass of waters will no wind obey which_jove sends one gust and bids them roll away
while wavering counsels thus his mind engage fluctuates in doubtful thought the pylian sage to join the host or to the general haste debating long he fixes on the last
yet as he moves the sight his bosom warms the field rings dreadful with the clang of arms the gleaming falchions flash the javelins fly blows echo blows and all or kill or die
by tardy steps ascending from the fleet the king of men ulysses the divine and who to tydeus owes his noble line
in lines advanced along the shelving strand whose bay the fleet unable to contain at length beside the margin of the main rank above rank the crowded ships they moor
him in his march the wounded princes meet their ships at distance from the battle stand who landed first lay highest on the shore
supported on the spears they took their way unfit to fight but anxious for the day wise_nestor approach alarm each grecian breast whom thus the general of the host address
grace and glory of the achaian name what drives thee wise_nestor from the field of fame shall then proud stern_hector see his boast fulfill
our fleets in ashes and our heroes kill such was his threat ah now too soon made good on many a grecian bosom writ in blood
is every heart inflamed with equal rage against your king nor will one chief engage and have i lived to see with mournful eyes
in every greek a new achilles rise gerenian wise_nestor then so fate has will and all confirming time has fate fulfill
the wall our late inviolable bound and best defence lies smoking on the ground even to the ships their conquering arms extend and groans of
not he that thunders from the aerial bower not which_jove himself upon the past has power slaughter greeks to heaven ascend
on speedy measures then employ your thought in such distress if counsel profit aught arms cannot much though mars our souls incite these gaping wounds withhold us from the fight
to him the monarch that our army bends that troy triumphant our high fleet ascends and that the rampart late our surest trust and best defence lies smoking in the dust all this from which_jove afflictive hand we bear who far from argos wills our ruin here
past are the days when happier greece was blest and all his favour all his aid confess now heaven averse our hands from battle ties and lifts the trojan glory to the skies
cease we at length to waste our blood in vain and launch what ships lie nearest to the main leave these at anchor till the coming night
then if impetuous troy forbear the fight bring all to sea and hoist each sail for flight better from evils well foreseen to run than perish in the danger we may shun
thus he the sage ulysses thus replies while anger flash from his disdainful eyes what shameful word unkingly as thou art
fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers and thou the shame of any host but ours
a host by which_jove endued with martial might and taught to conquer or to fall in fight adventurous combats and bold wars to wage employ our youth and yet employs our age
and wilt thou thus desert the trojan plain and have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain in such base sentence if thou couch thy fear speak it in whispers lest a greek should hear
lives there a man so dead to fame who dares to think such meanness or the thought declares and comes it even from him whose sovereign sway the banded legions of all greece obey
is this a general voice that calls to flight while war hangs doubtful while his soldiers fight what more could troy
no more the troops our hoisted sails in view themselves abandon shall the fight pursue but thy ships flying with despair shall see and owe destruction to a prince like thee
what yet their fate denies thou givest the foe all greece becomes their prize thy just reproofs atrides calm replies

tydides cut him short and thus began such counsel if you seek behold the man who boldly gives it and what he shall say young though he be disdain not to obey

such tydeus was the foremost once in fame nor lives in greece a stranger to his name then what for common good my thought inspire attend and in the son respect the sire
though sore of battle though with wounds oppress let each go forth and animate the rest advance the glory which he cannot share though not partaker witness of the war
beyond the missile javelin sounding flight safe let us stand and from the tumult far inspire the ranks and rule the distant war
but lest new wounds on wounds erpower us quite he added not the listening kings obey slow moving on atrides leads the way
the god of ocean to inflame their rage appears a warrior furrowed er with age press in his own the general hand he took and thus the venerable hero spoke atrides lo
with what disdainful eye achilles sees his country forces fly blind impious man whose anger is his guide who glories in unutterable pride
o er yonder sands soon shall thou view the scattered trojan bands fly diverse while proud kings and chiefs renown driven heaps on heaps with clouds involved around of rolling dust their winged wheels employ to hide their ignominious heads in troy
so may he perish so may which_jove disclaim the wretch relentless and erwhelm with shame but heaven forsakes not thee
he spoke then rush amid the warrior crew and sent his voice before him as he flew loud as the shout encountering armies yield when twice ten thousand shake the labouring field such was the voice and such the thundering sound of him whose trident rends the solid ground
meantime saturnia from olympus brow high throned in gold beheld the fields below with joy the glorious conflict she survey where her great brother gave the grecians aid
each argive bosom beats to meet the fight and grisly war appears a pleasing sight but placed aloft on ida shady height she sees her which_jove and trembles at the sight
at length she trusts her power resolved to prove the old yet still successful cheat of love against his wisdom to oppose her charms and lull the lord of thunders in her arms
swift to her bright apartment she repairs sacred to dress and beauty pleasing cares with skill divine had vulcan form the bower
which_jove to deceive what methods shall she try what arts to blind his all beholding eye safe from access of each intruding power
here first she bathes and round her body pours soft oils of fragrance and ambrosial showers the winds perfumed the balmy gale convey through heaven through earth and all the aerial way spirit divine
touch with her secret key the door unfold self closed behind her shut the valves of gold whose exhalation greets the sense of gods with more than mortal sweets
thus while she breathed of heaven with decent pride her artful hands the radiant tresses tied part on her head in shining ringlets roll part er her shoulders waved like melted gold
around her next a heavenly mantle flow that rich with pallas labour colours glow large clasps of gold the foldings gather d
round a golden zone her swelling bosom bound far beaming pendants tremble in her ear each gem illumined with a triple star
then er her head she cast a veil more white than new fallen snow and dazzling as the light last her fair feet celestial sandals grace
thus issuing radiant with majestic pace forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves and calls the mother of the smiles and loves
how long to venus thus apart she cried shall human strife celestial minds divide ah yet will venus aid saturnia joy and set aside the cause of greece and troy
then grant me said the queen those conquering charms that power which mortals and immortals warms that love which melts mankind in fierce desires and burns the son of heaven with sacred fires
let heaven dread empress cytheraea said speak her request and deem her will obey for lo i haste to those remote abodes where the great parents sacred source of gods
ocean and tethys their old empire keep on the last limits of the land and deep in their kind arms my tender years were past
what time old saturn from olympus cast of upper heaven to which_jove resign the reign whelm under the huge mass of earth and main
for strife i hear has made the union cease which held so long that ancient pair in peace what honour and what love shall i obtain
if i compose those fatal feuds again once more their minds in mutual ties engage and what my youth has owed repay their age

in this was every art and every charm to win the wisest and the coldest warm fond love the gentle vow the gay desire the kind deceit the still reviving fire persuasive speech and the more persuasive sighs silence that spoke and eloquence of eyes
she said with various skill and high embroidery graced this on her hand the cyprian goddess laid take this and with it all thy wish she said
with smiles she took the charm and smiling press the powerful cestus to her snowy breast then venus to the courts of which_jove withdrew whilst from olympus pleased saturnia flew
o er high pieria thence her course she bore er fair emathia ever pleasing shore er hemus hills with snows eternal crown nor once her flying foot approach the ground
then taking wing from athos lofty steep she speeds to lemnos er the rolling deep and seeks the cave of death half brother sleep
sweet pleasing sleep saturnia thus began who spread st thy empire er each god and man if er obsequious to thy juno will power of slumbers
hear and favour still shed thy soft dews on which_jove immortal eyes while sunk in love entrancing joys he lies a splendid footstool and a throne that shine with gold unfading somnus shall be thine

o er other gods i spread my easy chain the sire of all old ocean owns my reign and his hush waves lie silent on the main
but how unbidden shall i dare to steep which_jove awful temples in the dew of sleep long since too venturous at thy bold command on those eternal lids i laid my hand
what time deserting ilion wasted plain his conquering son alcides plough the main when lo the deeps arise the tempests roar and drive the hero to the coan shore
great which_jove awaking shook the blest abodes with rising wrath and tumbled gods on gods me chief he sought and from the realms on high had hurl indignant to the nether sky but gentle night to whom i fled for aid the friend of earth and heaven her wings display impower the wrath of gods and men to tame
even which_jove revered the venerable dame vain are thy fears the queen of heaven replies and speaking rolls her large majestic eyes

then swift as wind er lemnos smoky isle they wing their way and imbrus sea beat soil through air unseen involved in darkness glide and light on lectos on the point of ide mother of savages whose echoing hills are heard resounding with a hundred rills
there on a fir whose spiry branches rise to join its summit to the neighbouring skies dark in embowering shade conceal from sight sat sleep in likeness of the bird of night
fair ida trembles underneath the god hush are her mountain and her forests nod chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth but call cymindis by the race of earth
the god whose lightning sets the heavens on fire through all his bosom feels the fierce desire fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charms mix with her soul and melted in her arms
to ida top successful juno flies great which_jove surveys her with desiring eyes fix on her eyes he fed his eager look
then press her hand and thus with transport spoke why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky and not her steeds and flaming chariot nigh
then she i haste to those remote abodes where the great parents of the deathless gods the reverend ocean and gray tethys reign on the last limits of the land and main
i visit these to whose indulgent cares i owe the nursing of my tender years for strife i hear has made that union cease which held so long that ancient pair in peace
wait under ide of thy superior power to ask consent i leave the olympian bower nor seek unknown to thee the sacred cells deep under sea where hoary ocean dwells
the steeds prepared my chariot to convey er earth and sea and through the aerial way for that said which_jove suffice another day
but eager love denies the least delay let softer cares the present hour employ and be these moments sacred all to joy
ne er did my soul so strong a passion prove or for an earthly or a heavenly love not when i press ixion matchless dame whence rose pirithous like the gods in fame not when fair danae felt the shower of gold stream into life whence perseus brave and bold
not thus i burn for either theban dame bacchus from this from that alcides came nor phoenix daughter beautiful and young whence godlike rhadamanth and minos sprung
not thus i burn for fair latona face nor comelier ceres more majestic grace not thus even for thyself i felt desire
he spoke the goddess with the charming eyes glows with celestial red and thus replies is this a scene for love
our joys profaned by each familiar eye the sport of heaven and fable of the sky how shall i er review the blest abodes or mix among the senate of the gods
as now my veins receive the pleasing fire on ida height exposed to mortal and immortal sight shall i not think that with disorder charms all heaven beholds me recent from thy arms
with skill divine has vulcan form thy bower sacred to love and to the genial hour if such thy will to that recess retire in secret there indulge thy soft desire
she ceased and smiling with superior love thus answer mild the cloud compelling which_jove nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold shaded with clouds and circumfused in gold
not even the sun who darts through heaven his rays and whose broad eye the extended earth surveys gazing he spoke and kindling at the view his eager arms around the goddess threw
glad earth perceives and from her bosom pours unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers thick new born violets a soft carpet spread and clustering lotos swell the rising bed and sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow
and flamy crocus made the mountain glow there golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair steep in soft joys and circumfused with air celestial dews descending er the ground perfume the mount and breathe ambrosia round at length with love and sleep soft power oppress the panting thunderer nods and sinks to rest
now to the navy borne on silent wings to neptune ear soft sleep his message brings beside him sudden unperceived he stood and thus with gentle word address the god
now neptune now the important hour employ to check a while the haughty hopes of troy while which_jove yet rests while yet my vapours shed the golden vision round his sacred head for juno love and somnus pleasing ties have closed those awful and eternal eyes
neptune with zeal increased renews his care and towering in the foremost ranks of war indignant thus oh once of martial fame
thus having said the power of slumber flew on human lids to drop the balmy dew greeks if yet ye can deserve the name
this half recover day shall troy obtain shall stern_hector thunder at your ships again lo still he vaunts and threats the fleet with fires while stern_hector achilles in his wrath retires
one hero loss too tamely you deplore be still yourselves and ye shall need no more oh yet if glory any bosom warms brace on your firmest helms and stand to arms
his strongest spear each valiant grecian wield each valiant grecian seize his broadest shield let to the weak the lighter arms belong the ponderous targe be wielded by the strong
thus arm not stern_hector shall our presence stay myself ye greeks myself will lead the way illustration greek shield greek shield
the troops assent their martial arms they change the busy chiefs their banded legions range the kings though wounded and oppress with pain with helpful hands themselves assist the train
the strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield the weaker warrior takes a lighter shield thus sheath in shining brass in bright array the legions march and neptune leads the way
his brandish falchion flames before their eyes like lightning flashing through the frighted skies clad in his might the earth shaking power appears pale mortals tremble and confess their fears
troy great defender stands alone unawed arms his proud host and dares oppose a god and lo the god and wondrous man appear the sea stern_hector ruler there and stern_hector here
the roaring main at her great master call rose in huge ranks and form a watery wall around the ships sea hanging er the shores both armies join earth thunders ocean roars
the bellowing deeps resound when stormy winds disclose the dark profound less loud the winds that from the ćolian hall roar through the woods and make whole forests fall less loud the woods when flames in torrents pour catch the dry mountain and its shades devour with such a rage the meeting hosts are driven and such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven
the first bold javelin urged by stern_hector force direct at oilean_ajax bosom winged its course but there no pass the crossing belts afford
not half so loud one braced his shield and one sustain his sword then back the disappointed trojan drew and cursed the lance that unavailing flew
but scaped not oilean_ajax his tempestuous hand a ponderous stone upheaving from the sand where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior feet or served to ballast or to prop the fleet toss round and round the missive marble flings on the razed shield the fallen ruin rings full on his breast and throat with force descends nor deaden there its giddy fury spends but whirling on with many a fiery round smokes in the dust and ploughs into the ground
as when the bolt red hissing from above darts on the consecrated plant of which_jove the mountain oak in flaming ruin lies black from the blow and smokes of sulphur rise stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand and own the terrors of the almighty hand
so lies great stern_hector prostrate on the shore his slacken hand deserts the lance it bore his following shield the fallen chief erspread
beneath his helmet dropp his fainting head his load of armour sinking to the ground clanks on the field a dead and hollow sound
loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain greece sees in hope troy great defender slain all spring to seize him storms of arrows fly and thicker javelins intercept the sky
in vain an iron tempest hisses round he lies protected and without a wound polydamas agenor the divine the pious warrior of anchises line and each bold leader of the lycian band with covering shields a friendly circle stand his mournful followers with assistant care the groaning hero to his chariot bear his foaming coursers swifter than the wind speed to the town and leave the war behind
when now they touch the mead enamell side where gentle xanthus rolls his easy tide with watery drops the chief they sprinkle round placed on the margin of the flowery ground
raised on his knees he now ejects the gore now faints anew low sinking on the shore by fits he breathes half views the fleeting skies and seals again by fits his swimming eyes
soon as the greeks the chief retreat beheld with double fury each invades the field oilean_ajax first his javelin sped pierced by whose point the son of enops bled
satnius the brave whom beauteous neis bore amidst her flocks on satnio silver shore struck through the belly rim the warrior lies supine and shades eternal veil his eyes
an arduous battle rose around the dead by turns the greeks by turns the trojans bled fired with revenge polydamas drew near
and at prothoenor shook the trembling spear the driving javelin through his shoulder thrust he sinks to earth and grasps the bloody dust
we rule the field and thus their arms the race of panthus wield from this unerring hand there flies no dart
lo thus the victor cries but bathes its point within a grecian heart propp on that spear to which thou owest thy fall
go guide thy darksome steps to pluto dreary hall he said and sorrow touch each argive breast the soul of oilean_ajax burn above the rest
as by his side the groaning warrior fell at the fierce foe he launch his piercing steel the foe reclining shunn the flying death but fate archilochus demand thy breath
swift to perform heaven fatal will it fled full on the juncture of the neck and head and took the joint and cut the nerves in twain the dropping head first tumbled on the plain
thy lofty birth no succour could impart the wings of death ertook thee on the dart so just the stroke that yet the body stood erect then roll along the sands in blood
here proud polydamas here turn thy eyes the towering oilean_ajax loud insulting cries say is this chief extended on the plain a worthy vengeance for prothoenor slain
nor speak him vulgar nor of vulgar race some lines methinks may make his lineage known antenor brother or perhaps his son
mark well his port his figure and his face he spake and smiled severe for well he knew the bleeding youth
troy sadden at the view but furious acamas avenged his cause as promachus his slaughtered brother draws he pierced his heart such fate attends you all proud argives
destined by our arms to fall not troy alone but haughty greece shall share the toils the sorrows and the wounds of war
behold your promachus deprived of breath a victim owed to my brave brother death not unappeased he enters pluto gate who leaves a brother to revenge his fate
heart piercing anguish struck the grecian host but touch the breast of bold peneleus most at the proud boaster he directs his course
but young ilioneus received the spear ilioneus his father only care phorbas the rich of all the trojan train whom hermes loved and taught the arts of gain
full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall and from the fibres scoop the rooted ball drove through the neck and hurl him to the plain he lifts his miserable arms in vain
the boaster flies and shuns superior force swift his broad falchion fierce peneleus spread and from the spouting shoulders struck his head
to earth at once the head and helmet fly the lance yet sticking through the bleeding eye the victor seized and as aloft he shook the gory visage thus insulting spoke trojans
haste to his father let the tale be told let his high roofs resound with frantic woe such as the house of promachus must know let doleful tidings greet his mother ear such as to promachus sad spouse we bear
your great ilioneus behold when we victorious shall to greece return and the pale matron in our triumphs mourn dreadful he spoke then toss the head on high the trojans hear they tremble and they fly
aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall and dread the ruin that impends on all daughters of which_jove that on olympus shine ye all beholding all recording nine
o say when neptune made proud ilion yield what chief what hero first embrued the field of all the grecians what immortal name and whose bless trophies will ye raise to fame
thou first great oilean_ajax on the unsanguined plain laid hyrtius leader of the mysian train phalces and mermer wise_nestor son erthrew bold merion morys and hippotion slew
strong periphaetes and prothoon bled by teucer arrows mingled with the dead pierced in the flank by great_menelaus steel his people pastor hyperenor fell eternal darkness wrapp the warrior round and the fierce soul came rushing through the wound
but stretch in heaps before oileus son fall mighty numbers mighty numbers run oilean_ajax the less of all the grecian race skill in pursuit and swiftest in the chase
jupiter awaking sees the trojans repulsed from the trenches stern_hector in a swoon and neptune at the head of the greeks he is highly incensed at the artifice of juno who appeases him by her submissions she is then sent to iris and apollo
juno repairing to the assembly of the gods attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against jupiter in particular she touches mars with a violent resentment he is ready to take arms but is prevented by minerva
iris and apollo obey the orders of jupiter iris commands neptune to leave the battle to which after much reluctance and passion he consents
apollo reinspires stern_hector with vigour brings him back to the battle marches before him with his aegis and turns the fortune of the fight
he breaks down great part of the grecian wall the trojans rush in and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet but are as yet repelled by the greater oilean_ajax with a prodigious slaughter
illustration bacchus bacchus book xv argument the fifth battle at the ships and the acts of oilean_ajax now in swift flight they pass the trench profound and many a chief lay gasping on the ground
then stopp and panted where the chariots lie fear on their cheek and horror in their eye meanwhile awaken from his dream of love on ida summit sat imperial which_jove
round the wide fields he cast a careful view there saw the trojans fly the greeks pursue these proud in arms those scatter o er the plain
not far great stern_hector on the dust he spies his sad associates round with weeping eyes ejecting blood and panting yet for breath
and midst the war the monarch of the main his senses wandering to the verge of death the god beheld him with a pitying look and thus incensed to fraudful juno
spoke thou still adverse to the eternal will for ever studious in promoting ill thy arts have made the godlike stern_hector yield and driven his conquering squadrons from the field
canst thou unhappy in thy wiles withstand our power immense and brave the almighty hand hast thou forgot when bound and fix on high
from the vast concave of the spangled sky i hung thee trembling in a golden chain and all the raging gods opposed in vain
headlong i hurl them from the olympian hall stunn in the whirl and breathless with the fall for godlike hercules these deeds were done nor seem the vengeance worthy such a son
when by thy wiles induced fierce boreas toss the shipwreck hero on the coan coast him through a thousand forms of death i bore and sent to argos and his native shore
hear this remember and our fury dread nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head lest arts and blandishments successless prove thy soft deceits and well dissembled love
by every oath that powers immortal ties the foodful earth and all infolding skies by thy black waves tremendous styx that flow through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below by the dread honours of thy sacred head and that unbroken vow our virgin bed
not by my arts the ruler of the main steeps troy in blood and ranges round the plain by his own ardour his own pity sway to help his greeks he fought and disobey
the thunderer spoke imperial juno mourn and trembling these submissive word return else had thy juno better counsels given and taught submission to the sire of heaven
think st thou with me fair empress of the skies the immortal father with a smile replies then soon the haughty sea god shall obey nor dare to act
if truth inspires thy tongue proclaim our will to yon bright synod on the olympian hill our high decree let various iris know and call the god that bears the silver bow
but when we point the way let her descend and from the embattled plain command the sea god to his watery reign
while phoebus hastes great stern_hector to prepare to rise afresh and once more wake the war his labouring bosom re inspires with breath and calls his senses from the verge of death
greece chased by troy even to achilles fleet shall fall by thousands at the hero feet he not untouch with pity to
the plain shall send patroclus but shall send in vain what youths he slaughters under ilion walls even my loved son divine sarpedon falls
vanquish at last by stern_hector lance he lies then nor till then shall great achilles rise and lo that instant godlike stern_hector dies
from that great hour the war whole fortune turns pallas assists and lofty ilion burns not till that day shall which_jove relax his rage
the promise of a god i gave and seal it with the almighty nod achilles glory to the stars to raise such was our word and fate the word obeys
nor one of all the heavenly host engage in aid of greece the trembling queen the almighty order given swift from the idaean summit shot to heaven
he trod before sends forth his active mind from place to place joins hill to dale and measures space with space
as some wayfaring man who wanders er in thought a length of lands so swift flew juno to the bless abodes
if thought of man can match the speed of gods there sat the powers in awful synod placed they bow and made obeisance as she pass d
through all the brazen dome with goblets crown they hail her queen the nectar streams around fair themis first presents the golden bowl and anxious asks what cares disturb her soul
to whom the white arm goddess thus replies enough thou know st the tyrant of the skies severely bent his purpose to fulfil unmoved his mind and unrestrain his will
go thou the feasts of heaven attend thy call bid the crown nectar circle round the hall but which_jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome such stern_hector decrees such threaten woes to come
as soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise and damp the eternal banquets of the skies the goddess said and sullen took her place
to see the gathering grudge in every breast smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express while on her wrinkled front and eyebrow bent sat stedfast care and lowering discontent
black horror sadden each celestial face thus she proceeds attend ye powers above but know tis madness to contest with which_jove supreme he sits and sees in pride of sway
your vassal godheads grudgingly obey fierce in the majesty of power controls shakes all the thrones of heaven and bends the poles
submiss immortals all he wills obey and thou great mars begin and show the way behold ascalaphus behold him die but dare not murmur dare not vent a sigh
thy own loved boasted offspring lies erthrown if that loved boasted offspring be thy own stern_hector mars with anguish for his slaughter son smote his rebelling breast and fierce begun
thus shall mars obey forgive me gods and yield my vengeance way descending first to yon forbidden plain the god of battles dares avenge the slain
thus then immortals dares though the thunder bursting er my head should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead
with that he gives command to fear and flight to join his rapid coursers for the fight then grim in arms with hasty vengeance flies
discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven but pallas springing through the bright abode starts from her azure throne to calm the god
arms that reflect a radiance through the skies and now had which_jove by bold rebellion driven struck for the immortal race with timely fear from frantic mars
the shield and spear then the huge helmet lifting from his head thus to the impetuous homicide she said by what wild passion furious
she snatch art thou toss striv st thou with which_jove thou art already lost shall not the thunderer dread command restrain and was imperial juno heard in vain
ilion and greece no more should which_jove engage the skies would yield an ampler scene of rage guilty and guiltless find an equal fate and one vast ruin whelm the olympian state
back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven and in thy guilt involve the host of heaven cease then thy offspring death unjust to call heroes as great have died and yet shall fall
why should heaven law with foolish man comply exempted from the race ordain to die this menace fix the warrior to his throne sullen he sat and curb the rising groan
then juno call which_jove orders to obey the winged iris and the god of day go wait the thunderer will saturnia cried
on yon tall summit of the fountful ide there in the father awful presence stand receive and execute his dread command
she said and sat the god that gilds the day and various iris wing their airy way swift as the wind to ida hills they came fair nurse of fountains and of savage game
there sat the eternal he whose nod controls the trembling world and shakes the steady poles veil in a mist of fragrance him
they found with clouds of gold and purple circled round well pleased the thunderer saw their earnest care and prompt obedience to the queen of air
then while a smile serenes his awful brow commands the goddess of the showery bow iris descend and what we here ordain
report to yon mad tyrant of the main bid him from fight to his own deeps repair or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air
if he refuse then let him timely weigh our elder birthright and superior sway how shall his rashness stand the dire alarms if heaven omnipotence descend in arms
strives he with me by whom his power was given and is there equal to the lord of heaven the all mighty spoke the goddess wing d
swift as the rattling hail or fleecy snows drive through the skies when boreas fiercely blows so from the clouds descending iris falls and to blue neptune thus the goddess calls
in me behold the messenger of which_jove he bids thee from forbidden wars repair to thine own deeps or to the fields of air
her flight to sacred ilion from the idaean height attend the mandate of the sire above this if refused he bids thee timely weigh his elder birthright and superior sway
how shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms if heaven omnipotence descend in arms striv st thou with him by whom all power is given
and art thou equal to the lord of heaven what means the haughty sovereign of the skies the king of ocean thus incensed replies
i three brother deities from saturn came and ancient rhea earth immortal dame assign by lot our triple rule we know infernal pluto sways the shades below
o er the wide clouds and er the starry plain ethereal which_jove extends his high domain my court beneath the hoary waves i keep and hush the roarings of the sacred deep olympus and this earth in common lie what claim has here the tyrant of the sky
rule as he will his portion realms on high no vassal god nor of his train am far in the distant clouds let him control
and awe the younger brothers of the pole there to his children his commands be given the trembling servile second race of heaven
and must i then said she sire of floods bear this fierce answer to the king of gods correct it yet and change thy rash intent a noble mind disdains not to repent
to elder brothers guardian fiends are given to scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven great is the profit thus the god rejoin
when ministers are blest with prudent mind warn by thy word to powerful which_jove i yield and quit though angry the contended field not but his threats with justice i disclaim the same our honours and our birth the same
if yet forgetful of his promise given to hermes pallas and the queen of heaven to favour ilion that perfidious place he breaks his faith with half the ethereal race give him to know unless the grecian train lay yon proud structures level with the plain howe er the offence by other gods
be pass the wrath of neptune shall for ever last thus speaking furious from the field he strode and plunged into the bosom of the flood
the lord of thunders from his lofty height beheld and thus bespoke the source of light behold the god whose liquid arms are hurl d
around the globe whose earthquakes rock the world desists at length his rebel war to wage seeks his own sea and trembles at our rage else had my wrath heaven thrones all shaking round burn to the bottom of his sea profound and all the gods that round old saturn dwell had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell
well was the crime and well the vengeance spared even power immense had found such battle hard go thou my son
the trembling greeks alarm shake my broad aegis on thy active arm be godlike stern_hector thy peculiar care swell his bold heart and urge his strength to war
let ilion conquer till the achaian train fly to their ships and hellespont again then greece shall breathe from toils
not half so swift the sailing falcon flies that drives a turtle through the liquid skies as phoebus shooting from the idaean brow glides down the mountain to the plain below
there stern_hector seated by the stream he sees his sense returning with the coming breeze again his pulses beat his spirits rise again his loved companions meet his eyes which_jove thinking of his pains they pass away to whom the god who gives the golden day why sits great stern_hector from the field so far
the godhead said his will divine the son of which_jove obey what grief what wound withholds thee from the war
the fainting hero as the vision bright stood shining er him half unseal his sight what blest immortal with commanding breath thus wakens stern_hector from the sleep of death
has fame not told how while my trusty sword bathed greece in slaughter and her battle gored the mighty oilean_ajax with a deadly blow had almost sunk me to the shades below
even yet methinks the gliding ghosts i spy and hell black horrors swim before my eye to him apollo be no more dismay see and be strong
the thunderer sends thee aid behold thy phoebus shall his arms employ phoebus propitious still to thee and troy inspire thy warriors then with manly force
and to the ships impel thy rapid horse even i will make thy fiery coursers way and drive the grecians headlong to the sea
as when the pamper steed with reins unbound breaks from his stall and pours along the ground with ample strokes he rushes to the flood to bathe his sides and cool his fiery blood his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane dishevell o er his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the well known plain and springs exulting to his fields again urged by the voice divine thus stern_hector flew full of the god and all his hosts pursue
as when the force of men and dogs combined invade the mountain goat or branching hind far from the hunter rage secure they lie close in the rock not fated yet to die
thus to bold stern_hector spoke the son of which_jove and breathed immortal ardour from above when lo a lion shoots across the way
they fly at once the chasers and the prey so greece that late in conquering troops pursued and mark their progress through the ranks in blood
thoas with grief observed his dreadful course thoas the bravest of the ćtolian force skill to direct the javelin distant flight and bold to combat in the standing fight not more in councils famed for solid sense than winning word and heavenly eloquence
soon as they see the furious chief appear forget to vanquish and consent to fear gods what portent he cried these eyes invades
we saw him late by thundering oilean_ajax kill what god restores him to the frighted field and not content that half of greece lie slain pours new destruction on her son again
lo stern_hector rise from the stygian shades he comes not which_jove without thy powerful will lo still he lives pursues and conquers still
yet hear my counsel and his worst withstand the greeks main body to the fleet command but let the few whom brisker spirits warm stand the first onset and provoke the storm
thus point your arms and when such foes appear fierce as he is let stern_hector learn to fear the warrior spoke the listening greeks obey thickening their ranks and form a deep array
each oilean_ajax teucer merion gave command the valiant leader of the cretan band and mars like meges these the chiefs excite approach the foe and meet the coming fight

phoebus himself the rushing battle led a veil of clouds involved his radiant head high held before him which_jove enormous shield portentous shone and shaded all the field
vulcan to which_jove the immortal gift consign to scatter hosts and terrify mankind the greeks expect the shock the clamours rise from different parts and mingle in the skies
dire was the hiss of darts by heroes flung and arrows leaping from the bow string sung these drink the life of generous warriors slain those guiltless fall and thirst for blood in vain
as long as phoebus bore unmoved the shield sat doubtful conquest hovering er the field but when aloft he shakes it in the skies shouts in their ears and lightens in their eyes deep horror seizes every grecian breast their force is humbled and their fear confess
scatter wide no swain to guard them and no day to guide when two fell lions from the mountain come and spread the carnage through the shady gloom
so flies a herd of oxen impending phoebus pours around them fear and troy and stern_hector thunder in the rear heaps fall on heaps the slaughter stern_hector leads first great arcesilas then stichius bleeds
one to the bold boeotians ever dear and one menestheus friend and famed compeer medon and iasus ćneas sped this sprang from phelus and the athenians led but hapless medon from oileus came

the greeks dismay confused disperse or fall some seek the trench some skulk behind the wall while these fly trembling others pant for breath
on rush bold stern_hector gloomy as the night forbids to plunder animates the fight points to the fleet for by the gods
and er the slaughter stalks gigantic death who flies who dares but linger by this hand he dies no weeping sister his cold eye shall close
no friendly hand his funeral pyre compose who stops to plunder at this signal hour the birds shall tear him and the dogs devour
furious he said the smarting scourge resounds the coursers fly the smoking chariot bounds the hosts rush on loud clamours shake the shore the horses thunder earth and ocean roar

easy as when ashore an infant stands and draws imagined houses in the sands the sportive wanton pleased with some new play sweeps the slight works and fashion domes away thus vanish at thy touch the towers and walls the toil of thousands in a moment falls
the grecians gaze around with wild despair confused and weary all the powers with prayer exhort their men with praises threats commands and urge the gods with voices eyes and hands
the turrets nod the bulwarks fall experienced wise_nestor chief obtests the skies and weeps his country with a father eyes
thy shrine with offer gore if er in hope our country to behold we paid the fattest firstlings of the fold
o which_jove if ever on his native shore one greek enrich if er thou sign st our wishes with thy nod perform the promise of a gracious god
this day preserve our navies from the flame and save the relics of the grecian name thus prayed the sage the eternal gave consent and peals of thunder shook the firmament
as when black tempests mix the sea and skies the roaring deeps in watery mountain rise above the sides of some tall ship ascend its womb they deluge and its ribs they rend thus loudly roaring and erpowering all mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall legions on legions from each side arise thick sound the keels the storm of arrows flies
presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign and catch new fury at the voice divine fierce on the ships above the cars below these wield the mace and those the javelin throw
while thus the thunder of the battle raged and labouring armies round the works engaged still in the tent patroclus sat to tend the good eurypylus his wounded friend

he sprinkles healing balms to anguish kind and adds discourse the medicine of the mind express he wrings his hands he beats his manly breast
though yet thy state require redress he cries depart i must what horrors strike my eyes charged with achilles high command i go
a mournful witness of this scene of woe i haste to urge him by his country care to rise in arms and shine again in war
perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend the voice is powerful of a faithful friend he spoke and speaking swifter than the wind sprung from the tent and left the war behind
the embodied greeks the fierce attack sustain but strive though numerous to repulse in vain nor could the trojans through that firm array force to the fleet and tents the impervious way
as when a shipwright with palladian art smooths the rough wood and levels every part with equal hand he guides his whole design
by the just rule and the directing line the martial leaders with like skill and care preserved their line and equal kept the war
at one proud bark high towering er the fleet oilean_ajax the great and godlike stern_hector meet for one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend nor this the ships can fire nor that defend
brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried and every ship sustained an equal tide one kept the shore and one the vessel trod that fix as fate this acted by a god
the son of clytius in his daring hand the deck approaching shakes a flaming brand but pierced by ajax_telamon huge lance expires thundering he falls and drops the extinguish fires
great stern_hector view him with a sad survey as stretch in dust before the stern_hector he lay oh all of trojan all of lycian race
stand to your arms maintain this arduous space lo where the son of royal clytius lies ah save his arms secure his obsequies
this said his eager javelin sought the foe but oilean_ajax shunn the meditated blow not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown it stretch in dust
an exile long sustain at oilean_ajax board a faithful servant to a foreign lord in peace and war for ever at his side near his loved master as he lived he died
unhappy lycophron from the high poop he tumbles on the sand and lies a lifeless load along the land with anguish oilean_ajax views the piercing sight and thus inflames his brother to the fight
teucer behold extended on the shore our friend our loved companion now no more dear as a parent with a parent care to fight our wars he left his native air
this death deplored to stern_hector rage we owe revenge revenge it on the cruel foe where are those darts on which the fate attend
and where the bow which phoebus taught to bend impatient teucer hastening to his aid before the chief his ample bow display d
the well stored quiver on his shoulders hung then hiss his arrow and the bowstring sung clytus pisenor son renown in fame to thee polydamas
an honour name drove through the thickest of the embattled plains the startling steeds and shook his eager reins as all on glory ran his ardent mind the pointed death arrests him from behind
hurl from the lofty seat at distance far the headlong coursers spurn his empty car till sad polydamas the steeds restrain and gave astynous to thy careful hand then fired to vengeance rush amidst the foe
through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies in youth first bloom reluctantly he dies rage edged his sword and strengthen every blow
once more bold teucer in his country cause at stern_hector breast a chosen arrow draws and had the weapon found the destined way thy fall great trojan had renown that day
but stern_hector was not doom to perish then the all wise_nestor disposer of the fate of men imperial which_jove his present death withstands nor was such glory due to teucer hands
at its full stretch as the tough string he drew struck by an arm unseen it burst in two down dropp the bow the shaft with brazen head fell innocent
some god propitious to the trojan foe has from my arm unfailing struck the bow and broke the nerve my hands had twined with art strong to impel the flight of many a dart
since heaven commands it oilean_ajax made reply dismiss the bow and lay thy arrows by thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield and quit the quiver for the ponderous shield
and on the dust lay dead the astonish archer to great oilean_ajax cries some god prevents our destined enterprise in the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame thy brave example shall the rest inflame
fierce as they are by long successes vain to force our fleet or even a ship to gain asks toil and sweat and blood their utmost might shall find its match no more tis ours to fight
then teucer laid his faithless bow aside the fourfold buckler er his shoulder tied on his brave head a crested helm he placed with nodding horse hair formidably graced a dart whose point with brass refulgent shines the warrior wields and his great brother joins
this stern_hector saw and thus express his joy ye troops of lycia dardanus and troy be mindful of yourselves your ancient fame and spread your glory with the navy flame
which_jove is with us i saw his hand but now from the proud archer strike his vaunted bow indulgent which_jove how plain thy favours shine when happy nations bear the marks divine
how easy then to see the sinking state of realms accursed deserted reprobate such is the fate of greece and such is ours behold ye warriors and exert your powers
death is the worst a fate which all must try and for our country tis a bliss to die the gallant man though slain in fight he be yet leaves his nation safe his children free
entails a debt on all the grateful state his own brave friends shall glory in his fate his wife live honour all his race succeed
and late posterity enjoy the deed this roused the soul in every trojan breast the godlike oilean_ajax next his greeks address
how long ye warriors of the argive race to generous argos what a dire disgrace how long on these cursed confines will ye lie yet undetermined or to live or die
what hopes remain what methods to retire if once your vessels catch the trojan fire make how the flames approach how near they fall how stern_hector calls and troy obeys his call
tis now no time for wisdom or debates to your own hands are trusted all your fate and better far in one decisive strife one day should end our labour or our life than keep this hard got inch of barren sands still press and press by such inglorious hands
not to the dance that dreadful voice invites it calls to death and all the rage of fights the listening grecians feel their leader flame and every kindling bosom pants for fame
then mutual slaughters spread on either side by stern_hector here the phocian schedius died there pierced by oilean_ajax sunk laodamas chief of the foot of old antenor race
his lance bold meges at the victor threw the victor stooping from the death withdrew that valued life phoebus was thy care
but croesmus bosom took the flying spear his corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore his radiant arms triumphant meges bore
dolops the son of lampus rushes on sprung from the race of old laomedon and famed for prowess in a well fought field he pierced the centre of his sounding shield but meges phyleus ample breastplate wore well known in fight on selle winding shore
polydamas laid otus on the sand the fierce commander of the epeian band for king euphetes gave the golden mail compact and firm with many a jointed scale
full at the trojan head he urged his lance where the high plumes above the helmet dance new ting with tyrian dye in dust below shorn from the crest the purple honours glow
which oft in cities storm and battles won had saved the father and now saves the son meantime their fight the spartan king survey and stood by meges side a sudden aid
through dolops shoulder urged his forceful dart which held its passage through the panting heart and issued at his breast with thundering sound the warrior falls extended on the ground
in rush the conquering greeks to spoil the slain but stern_hector voice excites his kindred train the hero most from hicetaon sprung fierce melanippus gallant brave and young
he ere to troy the grecians cross the main fed his large oxen on percote plain but when oppress his country
claim his care return to ilion and excell in war for this in priam court he held his place beloved no less than priam royal race

he falls to two at once a prey and lo they bear the bloody arms away come on a distant war no longer wage but hand to hand thy country foes engage
till greece at once and all her glory end or ilion from her towery height descend heaved from the lowest stone and bury all in one sad sepulchre one common fall
stern_hector this said rush forward on the foes with equal ardour melanippus glows then oilean_ajax thus greeks respect your fame
let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire and catch from breast to breast the noble fire on valour side the odds of combat lie the brave live glorious or lamented die
respect yourselves and learn an honest shame the wretch that trembles in the field of fame meets death and worse than death eternal shame
his generous sense he not in vain imparts it sunk and rooted in the grecian hearts they join they throng they thicken at his call and flank the navy with a brazen wall shields touching shields in order blaze above and stop the trojans though impell by which_jove
the fiery spartan first with loud applause warms the bold son of wise_nestor in his cause is there he said in arms a youth like you so strong to fight so active to pursue
why stand you distant nor attempt a deed lift the bold lance and make some trojan bleed he said and backward to the lines retired forth rush d
the youth with martial fury fired beyond the foremost ranks his lance he threw and round the black battalions cast his view
advancing melanippus met the dart with his bold breast and felt it in his heart thundering he falls his falling arms resound and his broad buckler rings against the ground
the troops of troy recede with sudden fear while the swift javelin hiss along in air the victor leaps upon his prostrate prize
thus on a roe the well breath beagle flies and rends his side fresh bleeding with the dart the distant hunter sent into his heart
observing stern_hector to the rescue flew bold as he was antilochus withdrew so when a savage ranging er the plain has torn the shepherd dog or shepherd swain
while conscious of the deed he glares around and hears the gathering multitude resound timely he flies the yet untasted food and gains the friendly shelter of the wood
so fears the youth all troy with shouts pursue while stones and darts in mingled tempest flew but enter in the grecian ranks he turns his manly breast and with new fury burns
the sire of gods confirming thetis prayer the grecian ardour quench in deep despair but lifts to glory troy prevailing bands swells all their hearts and strengthens all their hands
now on the fleet the tides of trojans drove fierce to fulfil the stern_hector decrees of which_jove on ida top he waits with longing eyes to view the navy blazing to the skies
these fate revolved in his almighty mind he raises stern_hector to the work design bids him with more than mortal fury glow and drives him like a lightning on the foe
then nor till then the scale of war shall turn the trojans fly and conquer ilion burn so mars when human crimes for vengeance call shakes his huge javelin and whole armies fall
he foams with wrath beneath his gloomy brow like fiery meteors his red eye balls glow the radiant helmet on his temple burns waves when he nods and lightens as he turns
not with more rage a conflagration rolls wraps the vast mountain and involves the poles for which_jove his splendour round the chief had thrown and cast the blaze of both the hosts on one
due to stern_hector pallas and pelides spear yet which_jove deferr the death he was to pay and gave what fate allow the honours of a day
now all on fire for fame his breast his eyes burn at each foe and single every prize still at the closest ranks the thickest fight he points his ardour and exerts his might
unhappy glories for his fate was near the grecian phalanx moveless as a tower on all sides batter yet resists his power
by winds assail by billows beat in vain unmoved it hears above the tempest blow and sees the watery mountain break below
girt in surrounding flames he seems to fall like fire from which_jove and bursts upon them all bursts as a wave
that from the cloud impends and swell with tempests on the ship descends white are the decks with foam the winds aloud howl er the masts and sing through every shroud pale trembling tired the sailors freeze with fears and instant death on every wave appears
so some tall rock erhangs the hoary main so pale the greeks the eyes of stern_hector meet the chief so thunders and so shakes the fleet
as when a lion rushing from his den amidst the plain of some wide water fen where numerous oxen as at ease they feed at large expatiate er the ranker mead
leaps on the herds before the herdsman eyes the trembling herdsman far to distance flies some lordly bull the rest dispersed and fled
thus from the rage of which_jove like stern_hector flew all greece in heaps but one he seized and slew mycenian periphes a mighty name
in wisdom great in arms well known to fame the minister of stern_hector eurystheus ire against alcides copreus was his sire
the son redeem the honours of the race a son as generous as the sire was base er all his country youth conspicuous far in every virtue or of peace or war
he singles out arrests and lays him dead but doom to stern_hector stronger force to yield against the margin of his ample shield he struck his hasty foot his heels up sprung
supine he fell his brazen helmet rung on the fallen chief the invading trojan press and plunged the pointed javelin in his breast
his circling friends who strove to guard too late the unhappy hero fled or shared his fate chased from the foremost line the grecian train now man the next receding toward the main
wedged in one body at the tents they stand wall round with sterns a gloomy desperate band now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight now fear itself confines them to the fight
man courage breathes in man but wise_nestor most the sage preserver of the grecian host exhorts adjures to guard these utmost shores and by their parents by themselves implores
oh friends be men your generous breasts inflame with mutual honour and with mutual shame think of your hopes your fortune all the care your wife your infant and your parents share
think of each living father reverend head think of each ancestor with glory dead absent by me they speak by me
they sue they ask their safety and their fame from you the gods their fate on this one action lay and all are lost if you desert the day
the mist of darkness which_jove around them threw she clear restoring all the war to view a sudden ray shot beaming er the plain and show the shores the navy and the main stern_hector they saw and all who fly or fight the scene wide opening to the blaze of light first of the field great
he spoke and round him breathed heroic fires minerva seconds what the sage inspires oilean_ajax strikes their eyes his port majestic and his ample size a ponderous mace with studs of iron crown
full twenty cubits long he swings around nor fights like others fix to certain stands but looks a moving tower above the bands high on the decks with vast gigantic stride the godlike hero stalks from side to side
so when a horseman from the watery mead skill in the manage of the bounding steed drives four fair coursers practised to obey
to some great city through the public way safe in his art as side by side they run he shifts his seat and vaults from one to one and now to this and now to that he flies admiring numbers follow with their eyes
as furious stern_hector thunder threats aloud and rush enraged before the trojan crowd then swift invades the ships whose beaky prores lay rank contiguous on the bending shores so the strong eagle from his airy height who marks the swans or cranes embodied flight stoops down impetuous while they light for food and stooping darkens with his wings the flood
from ship to ship thus oilean_ajax swiftly flew no less the wonder of the warring crew which_jove leads him on with his almighty hand and breathes fierce spirits in his following band
thou wouldst have thought so furious was their fire no force could tame them and no toil could tire as if new vigour from new fights they won and the long battle was but then begun
the warring nations meet the battle roars thick beats the combat on the sounding prores greece yet unconquer kept alive the war secure of death confiding in despair
the main bright with the blaze and red with heroes slain like strength is felt from hope and from despair and each contends as his were all the war
troy in proud hopes already view twas thou bold stern_hector whose resistless hand first seized a ship on that contested strand
the first that touch the unhappy trojan shore for this in arms the warring nations stood and bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood
the same which dead protesilaus bore no room to poise the lance or bend the bow but hand to hand and man to man they grow
the falchions ring shields rattle axes sound swords flash in air or glitter on the ground with streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed and slaughter heroes swell the dreadful tide
wounded they wound and seek each other hearts with falchions axes swords and shorten darts still raging stern_hector with his ample hand grasps the high stern_hector and gives this loud command
illustration oilean_ajax defending the greek ships oilean_ajax defending the greek ships haste bring the flames that toil of ten long years is finished and the day desired appears
this happy day with acclamations greet bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet the coward counsels of a timorous throng of reverend dotards check our glory long too long which_jove lull d
us with lethargic charms but now in peals of thunder calls to arms in this great day he crowns our full desires wakes all our force and seconds all our fires
he spoke the warriors at his fierce command pour a new deluge on the grecian band even oilean_ajax paused so thick the javelins fly stepp back and doubted or to live or die
yet where the oars are placed he stands to wait what chief approaching dares attempt his fate even to the last his naval charge defends now shakes his spear now lifts and now protends even yet the greeks with piercing shouts inspires amidst attacks and deaths and darts and fires
friends heroes names for ever dear once son of mars and thunderbolts of war ah yet be mindful of your old renown your great forefathers virtues and your own
what aids expect you in this utmost strait what bulwarks rising between you and fate no aids no bulwarks your retreat attend no friends to help no city to defend
this spot is all you have to lose or keep there stand the trojans and here rolls the deep tis hostile ground you tread your native lands far far from hence
your fate are in your hands raging he spoke nor further wastes his breath but turns his javelin to the work of death

castor and pollux book xvi the armour horses soldiers and officers are described achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend after which patroclus leads the myrmidons to battle
the trojans at the sight of patroclus in achilles armour taking him for that hero are cast into the uttermost consternation he beats them off from the vessels stern_hector himself flies sarpedon is killed though jupiter was averse to his fate
several other particulars of the battle are described in the heat of which patroclus neglecting the orders of achilles pursues the foe to the walls of troy where apollo repulses and disarms him euphorbus wounds him and stern_hector kills him which concludes the book
meantime patroclus to achilles flies the streaming tears fall copious from his eyes not faster trickling to the plains below from the tall rock the sable waters flow
so warr both armies on the ensanguined shore while the black vessels smoked with human gore divine pelides with compassion moved
thus spoke indulgent to his best beloved patroclus say what grief thy bosom bears that flows so fast in these unmanly tears
no girl no infant whom the mother keeps from her loved breast with fonder passion weeps not more the mother soul that infant warms clung to her knees and reaching at her arms than thou hast mine
oh tell me to what end thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend griev st thou for me or for my martial band
our fathers live our first most tender care thy good menoetius breathes the vital air and hoary peleus yet extends his days pleased in their age to hear their children praise
perhaps yon relics of the grecian name doom in their ships to sink by fire and sword and pay the forfeit of their haughty lord
or come sad tidings from our native land or may some meaner cause thy pity claim whate er the cause reveal thy secret care and speak those sorrows which a friend would share

such conference held the chiefs while on the strand great which_jove with conquest crown the trojan band oilean_ajax no more spent and erpower he barely breathes at most
yet scarce an army stirs him from his post dangers on dangers all around him glow and toil to toil and woe succeeds to woe
stern_hector waved his sword and standing near where furious oilean_ajax plied his ashen spear full on the lance a stroke so justly sped that the broad falchion lopp its brazen head his pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain the brazen head falls sounding on the plain

forth in the midst and thus the god implored thou supreme high throned all height above great pelasgic dodonaean which_jove
their feet unwash their slumbers on the ground who hear from rustling oaks thy dark decrees and catch the fate low whispered in the breeze
who midst surrounding frosts and vapours chill presid st on bleak dodona vocal hill whose groves the selli race austere surround hear as of old
lo to the dangers of the fighting field the best the dearest of my friends i yield though still determined to my ships confined patroclus gone i stay but half behind
oh be his guard thy providential care confirm his heart and string his arm to war press by his single force let stern_hector see his fame in arms not owing all to me
but when the fleets are saved from foes and fire let him with conquest and renown retire preserve his arms preserve his social train and safe return him to these eyes again
great which_jove consents to half the chief request but heaven eternal doom denies the rest to free the fleet was granted to his prayer his safe return the winds dispersed in air
thou gav st at thetis prayer glory to me and to the greeks despair back to his tent the stern_hector achilles flies and waits the combat with impatient eyes
as wasps provoked by children in their play pour from their mansions by the broad highway in swarms the guiltless traveller engage whet all their stings and call forth all their rage
meanwhile the troops beneath patroclus care invade the trojans and commence the war all rise in arms and with a general cry
assert their waxen domes and buzzing progeny thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms so loud their clamours and so keen their arms
be mindful of your deeds in ancient days your godlike master let your acts proclaim and add new glories to his mighty name
their rising rage patroclus breath inspires who thus inflames them with heroic fires warriors partners of achilles praise think your achilles sees you fight be brave and humble the proud monarch whom you save
joyful they heard and kindling as he spoke flew to the fleet involved in fire and smoke from shore to shore the doubling shouts resound the hollow ships return a deeper sound
the war stood still and all around them gazed when great achilles shining armour blazed troy saw and thought the dread achilles nigh at once they see they tremble and they fly
close to the stern_hector of that famed ship which bore unbless protesilaus to ilion shore the great paeonian bold pyrechmes stood who led his bands from axius winding flood his shoulder blade receives the fatal wound the groaning warrior pants upon the ground
then first thy spear divine patroclus flew where the war raged and where the tumult grew his troops that see their country glory slain fly diverse scatter o er the distant plain
patroclus arm forbids the spreading fires and from the half burn ship proud troy retires clear from the smoke the joyful navy lies in heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies triumphant greece her rescued decks ascends and loud acclaim the starry region rends
so when thick clouds enwrap the mountain head er heaven expanse like one black ceiling spread sudden the thunderer with a flashing ray bursts through the darkness and lets down the day the hills shine out the rocks in prospect rise and streams and vales and forests strike the eyes the smiling scene wide opens to the sight and all the unmeasured ether flames with light
but troy repulsed and scatter o er the plains forced from the navy yet the fight maintains now every greek some hostile hero slew but still the foremost bold patroclus flew
sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound the brazen pointed spear with vigour thrown the thigh transfix and broke the brittle bone headlong he fell
as areilycus had turn him round next thoas was thy chance thy breast unarm received the spartan lance phylides dart as amphidus drew nigh
his blow prevented and transpierced his thigh tore all the brawn and rent the nerves away in darkness and in death the warrior lay
in equal arms two son of wise_nestor stand and two bold brothers of the lycian band by great antilochus atymnius dies pierced in the flank lamented youth
he lies kind maris bleeding in his brother wound defends the breathless carcase on the ground furious he flies his murderer to engage
but godlike thrasimed prevents his rage between his arm and shoulder aims a blow his arm falls spouting on the dust below he sinks with endless darkness cover o er and vents his soul effused with gushing gore
slain by two brothers thus two brothers bleed sarpedon friends amisodarus seed amisodarus who by furies led the bane of men
abhorr chimaera bred skill in the dart in vain his son expire and pay the forfeit of their guilty sire stopp d
in the tumult cleobulus lies beneath oileus arm a living prize a living prize not long the trojan stood the thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood
amid the ranks with mutual thirst of fame lycon the brave and fierce peneleus came in vain their javelins at each other flew now met in arms their eager swords they drew
plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies black death and fate unpitying seal his eyes on the plumed crest of his boeotian foe
the daring lycon aim a noble blow the sword broke short but his peneleus sped full on the juncture of the neck and head
o ertaken neamas by merion bleeds pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds back from the car he tumbles to the ground his swimming eyes eternal shades surround
the head divided by a stroke so just hung by the skin the body sunk to dust next erymas was doom his fate to feel his open mouth received the cretan steel
beneath the brain the point a passage tore crash the thin bones and drown the teeth in gore his mouth his eyes his nostrils pour a flood he sobs his soul out in the gush of blood
as when the flocks neglected by the swain or kids or lambs lie scatter o er the plain a troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey and rend the trembling unresisting prey
thus on the foe the greeks impetuous came troy fled unmindful of her former fame but still at stern_hector godlike oilean_ajax aim still pointed at his breast his javelin flamed
the trojan chief experienced in the field er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield observed the storm of darts the grecians pour
and on his buckler caught the ringing shower he sees for greece the scale of conquest rise yet stops and turns and saves his loved allies
as when the hand of which_jove a tempest forms and rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms dark er the fields the ascending vapour flies and shades the sun and blots the golden skies so from the ships along the dusky plain dire flight and terror drove the trojan train
the fiery coursers forced their lord away while far behind his trojans fall confused wedged in the trench in one vast carnage bruised chariots on chariots roll the clashing spokes shock while the madding steeds break short their yokes
even stern_hector fled through heads of disarray in vain they labour up the steepy mound their charioteers lie foaming on the ground
fierce on the rear with shouts patroclus flies tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight clouds rise on clouds and heaven is snatch from sight
loud er the rout was heard the victor cry where the war bleeds and where the thickest die where horse and arms and chariots he erthrown and bleeding heroes under axles groan
the affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down scour er the fields and stretch to reach the town no stop no check the steeds of peleus knew from bank to bank the immortal coursers flew
high bounding er the fosse the whirling car smokes through the ranks ertakes the flying war and thunders after stern_hector stern_hector flies patroclus shakes his lance but fate denies
not with less noise with less impetuous force the tide of trojans urge their desperate course than when in autumn which_jove his fury pours and earth is loaden with incessant showers when guilty mortals break the eternal laws or judges bribed betray the righteous cause
from their deep beds he bids the rivers rise and opens all the flood gates of the skies the impetuous torrents from their hills obey whole fields are drown and mountain swept away loud roars the deluge till it meets the main and trembling man sees all his labours vain
and now the chief the foremost troops repell back to the ships his destined progress held bore down half troy in his resistless way and forced the routed ranks to stand the day
between the space where silver simois flows where lay the fleets and where the rampires rose all grim in dust and blood patroclus stands and turns the slaughter on the conquering bands
thestor was next who saw the chief appear and fell the victim of his coward fear shrunk up he sat with wild and haggard eye nor stood to combat nor had force to fly
first pronous died beneath his fiery dart which pierced below the shield his valiant heart patroclus mark him as he shunn the war and with unmanly tremblings shook the car and dropp the flowing reins
as on a rock that overhangs the main an angler studious of the line and cane some mighty fish draws panting to the shore not with less ease the barbed javelin bore the gaping dastard as the spear was shook he fell and life his heartless breast forsook
him twixt the jaws the javelin sticks and from the chariot draws next on eryalus he flies a stone large as a rock was by his fury thrown
full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew and burst the helm and cleft the head in two prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell and death involved him with the shades of hell
then low in dust epaltes echius lie ipheas evippus polymelus die amphoterus and erymas succeed and last tlepolemus and pyres bleed
where er he moves the growing slaughters spread in heaps on heaps a monument of dead when now sarpedon his brave friends beheld grovelling in dust and gasping on the field
with this reproach his flying host he warms oh stain to honour oh disgrace to arms forsake inglorious the contended plain this hand unaided shall the war sustain
the task be mine this hero strength to try who mows whole troops and makes an army fly he spake and speaking leaps from off the car patroclus lights and sternly waits the war
as when two vultures on the mountain height stoop with resounding pinions to the fight they cuff they tear they raise a screaming cry
the desert echoes and the rocks reply the warriors thus opposed in arms engage with equal clamours and with equal rage
which_jove view the combat whose event foreseen he thus bespoke his sister and his queen the hour draws on the destinies ordain
my godlike son shall press the phrygian plain already on the verge of death he stands his life is owed to fierce patroclus hands
say shall i snatch him from impending fate and send him safe to lycia distant far from all the dangers and the toils of war or to his doom my bravest offspring yield and fatten with celestial blood the field
what passions in a parent breast debate then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes what word are these sovereign of the skies
short is the date prescribed to mortal man shall which_jove for one extend the narrow span whose bounds were fix before his race began
how many son of gods foredoom to death before proud ilion must resign their breath were thine exempt debate would rise above and murmuring powers condemn their partial which_jove
give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight and when the ascending soul has wing her flight let sleep and death convey by thy command
his friends and people to his future praise a marble tomb and pyramid shall raise and lasting honours to his ashes give his fame tis all the dead can have shall live
the breathless body to his native land she said the cloud compeller overcome assents to fate and ratifies the doom then touch with grief the weeping heavens distill d
the god his eyes averting from the plain laments his son predestined to be slain far from the lycian shores his happy native reign
now met in arms the combatants appear each heaved the shield and poised the lifted spear from strong patroclus hand the javelin fled and pass the groin of valiant thrasymed the nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain he falls and falling bites the bloody plain
the first aloof with erring fury flew the next transpierced achilles mortal steed the generous pedasus of theban breed fix in the shoulder joint he reel around roll in the bloody dust and paw the slippery ground
his sudden fall the entangled harness broke each axle crackled and the chariot shook when bold automedon to disengage the starting coursers and restrain their rage divides the traces with his sword and freed the encumbered chariot from the dying steed the rest move on obedient to the rein the car rolls slowly er the dusty plain
the towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance and first sarpedon whirl his weighty lance which er the warrior shoulder took its course and spent in empty air its dying force
a shower of blood er all the fatal field two sounding darts the lycian leader threw not so patroclus never erring dart aim d
at his breast it pierced a mortal part where the strong fibres bind the solid heart then as the mountain oak or poplar tall or pine fit mast for some great admiral
nods to the axe till with a groaning sound it sinks and spreads its honours on the ground thus fell the king and laid on earth supine
before his chariot stretch his form divine he grasp the dust distain with streaming gore and pale in death lay groaning on the shore
so lies a bull beneath the lion paws while the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws the trembling limbs and sucks the smoking blood deep groans and hollow roars rebellow through the wood
the dying chief address his last command glaucus be bold thy task be first to dare the glorious dangers of destructive war to lead my troops to combat at their head incite the living and supply the dead
then to the leader of the lycian band tell them i charged them with my latest breath not unrevenged to bear sarpedon death
then as a friend and as a warrior fight defend my body conquer in my right that taught by great examples all may try like thee to vanquish or like me to die
what grief what shame must glaucus undergo if these spoil arms adorn a grecian foe he ceased the fate suppress d
the prostrate prince and on his bosom trod then drew the weapon from his panting heart the reeking fibres clinging to the dart from the wide wound gush out a stream of blood and the soul issued in the purple flood
his labouring breath and his eyes darken with the shades of death the insulting victor with disdain bestrode his flying steeds the myrmidons detain unguided now their mighty master slain
his painful arm yet useless with the smart inflicted late by teucer deadly dart supported on his better hand he stay
he pray all seeing monarch whether lycia coast or sacred ilion thy bright presence boast powerful alike to ease the wretch smart
all impotent of aid transfix with grief unhappy glaucus heard the dying chief to phoebus then twas all he could hear me
that thrills my arm and shoots through every vein i stand unable to sustain the spear and sigh at distance from the glorious war
god of every healing art lo stiff with clotted blood and pierced with pain low in the dust is great sarpedon laid nor which_jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid
but thou god of health thy succour lend to guard the relics of my slaughter friend for thou though distant canst restore my might to head my lycians and support the fight
apollo heard and suppliant as he stood his heavenly hand restrain the flux of blood he drew the dolours from the wounded part and breathed a spirit in his rising heart
first to the fight his native troops he warms then loudly calls on troy vindictive arms with ample strides he stalks from place to place
renew by art divine the hero stands and owns the assistance of immortal hands now fires agenor now polydamas ćneas next and stern_hector he accosts inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts
what thought regardless chief thy breast employ oh too forgetful of the friends of troy those generous friends who from their country far breathe their brave souls out in another war
in action valiant and in council wise_nestor who guarded right and kept his people free to all his lycians lost and lost to thee
see where in dust the great sarpedon lies stretch by patroclus arm on yonder plains save from hostile rage his loved remains
ah let not greece his conquer trophies boast nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost he spoke each leader in his grief partook troy at the loss through all her legions shook
at once his country pillar and their own a chief who led to troy beleaguer wall a host of heroes and outshined them all
transfix with deep regret they view erthrown fired they rush on first stern_hector seeks the foes and with superior vengeance greatly glows
but er the dead the fierce patroclus stands and rousing oilean_ajax roused the listening bands heroes be men be what you were before or weigh the great occasion and be more
the chief who taught our lofty walls to yield lies pale in death extended on the field to guard his body troy in numbers flies tis half the glory to maintain our prize
the heroes kindle at his fierce command the martial squadrons close on either hand here troy and lycia charge with loud alarms thessalia there and greece oppose their arms
haste strip his arms the slaughter round him spread and send the living lycians to the dead with horrid shouts they circle round the slain the clash of armour rings er all the plain
great which_jove to swell the horrors of the fight er the fierce armies pours pernicious night and round his son confounds the warring hosts his fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts
now greece gives way and great epigeus falls agacleus son from budium lofty walls who chased for murder thence a suppliant came to peleus and the silver footed dame now sent to troy achilles arms to aid he pays due vengeance to his kinsman shade
soon as his luckless hand had touch the dead a rock large fragment thunder on his head hurl by hectorean force it cleft in twain
his shatter helm and stretch him er the slain fierce to the van of fight patroclus came and like an eagle darting at his game
what grief thy heart what fury urged thy hand generous greek when with full vigour thrown at sthenelaus flew the weighty stone which sunk him to the dead when troy too near that arm drew back and stern_hector learn to fear
far as an able hand a lance can throw or at the lists or at the fighting foe so far the trojans from their lines retired till glaucus turning all the rest inspired
sprung on the trojan and the lycian band then bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage the only hope of chalcon trembling age wide er the land was stretch d
his large domain with stately seats and riches blest in vain him bold with youth and eager to pursue the flying lycians glaucus met and slew
the achaians sorrow for their heroes slain with conquering shouts the trojans shake the plain and crowd to spoil the dead the greeks oppose an iron circle round the carcase grows
pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound he fell and falling made the fields resound then brave laogonus resign his breath despatch by merion to the shades of death
on ida holy hill he made abode the priest of which_jove and honour like his god between the jaw and ear the javelin went
who stooping forward from the death withdrew the lance hiss harmless er his covering shield and trembling struck and rooted in the field there yet scarce spent it quivers on the plain sent by the great aeneas arm in vain
the soul exhaling issued at the vent his spear aeneas at the victor threw swift as thou art the raging hero cries
and skill in dancing to dispute the prize my spear the destined passage had it found had fix thy active vigour to the ground
valiant leader of the dardan host insulted merion thus retorts the boast strong as you are tis mortal force you trust an arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust
and if to this my lance thy fate be given vain are thy vaunts success is still from heaven this instant sends thee down to pluto coast mine is the glory his thy parting ghost
with word to combat ill befits the brave not empty boasts the son of troy repel your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell
friend menoetius son this answer gave to speak beseems the council but to dare in glorious action is the task of war
this said patroclus to the battle flies great merion follows and new shouts arise shields helmets rattle as the warriors close and thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows
as through the shrilling vale or mountain ground the labours of the woodman axe resound blows following blows are heard re echoing wide while crackling forests fall on every side thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms so fell the warriors and so rung their arms
now great sarpedon on the sandy shore his heavenly form defaced with dust and gore and stuck with darts by warring heroes shed lies undistinguish from the vulgar dead
his long disputed corse the chiefs enclose on every side the busy combat grows thick as beneath some shepherd thatch abode the pails high foaming with a milky flood
the buzzing flies a persevering train incessant swarm and chased return again which_jove view the combat with a stern_hector survey and eyes that flash intolerable day
his breast debates the vengeance due and meditates the fate whether to urge their prompt effect and call the force of stern_hector to patroclus fall this instant see his short lived trophies won and stretch him breathless on his slaughter son or yet with many a soul untimely flight augment the fame and horror of the fight
fix on the field his sight to crown achilles valiant friend with praise at length he dooms and that his last of days shall set in glory bids him drive the foe
then stern_hector mind he fills with dire dismay he mounts his car and calls his hosts away sunk with troy heavy fate he sees decline the scales of which_jove and pants with awe divine
then nor before the hardy lycians fled and left their monarch with the common dead around in heaps on heaps a dreadful wall of carnage rise as the heroes fall
nor unattended see the shades below so which_jove decreed at length the greeks obtain the prize contested and despoil the slain
the radiant arms are by patroclus borne patroclus ships the glorious spoil adorn then thus to phoebus in the realms above spoke from his throne the cloud compelling which_jove
on the phrygian plain and from the fight convey sarpedon slain then bathe his body in the crystal flood with dust dishonour and deform with blood er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed and with celestial robes adorn the dead
they to his friends the immortal charge shall bear his friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear what honour mortals after death receive those unavailing honours we may give
descend my phoebus those rites discharged his sacred corse bequeath to the soft arms of silent sleep and death illustration sleep and death conveying the body of sarpedon to lycia
apollo bows and from mount ida height swift to the field precipitates his flight thence from the war the breathless hero bore veil in a cloud to silver simois shore there bathed his honourable wounds and dress his manly members in the immortal vest and with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews restores his freshness and his form renews
then sleep and death two twins of winged race of matchless swiftness but of silent pace received sarpedon at the god command
and in a moment reach the lycian land the corse amidst his weeping friends they laid where endless honours wait the sacred shade
sleep and death conveying the body of sarpedon to lycia meanwhile patroclus pours along the plains with foaming coursers and with loosen reins
fierce on the trojan and the lycian crew ah blind to fate thy headlong fury flew against what fate and powerful which_jove ordain
for he the god whose counsels uncontroll dismay the mighty and confound the bold the god who gives resumes and orders all he urged thee on and urged thee on to fall
who last beneath thy vengeance press the plain when heaven itself thy fatal fury led and call to fill the number of the dead
vain was thy friend command thy courage vain who first brave hero by that arm was slain adrestus first autonous then succeeds echeclus follows next young megas bleeds epistor melanippus bite the ground
now troy had stoop beneath his matchless power but flaming phoebus kept the sacred tower thrice at the battlements patroclus strook
his blazing aegis thrice apollo shook he tried the fourth when bursting from the cloud a more than mortal voice was heard aloud
the slaughter elasus and mulius crown then sunk pylartes to eternal night the rest dispersing trust their fate to flight
patroclus cease this heaven defended wall defies thy lance not fated yet to fall thy friend thy greater far it shall withstand
troy shall not stoop even to achilles hand so spoke the god who darts celestial fires the greek obeys him and with awe retires
while stern_hector checking at the scaean gates his panting coursers in his breast debates or in the field his forces to employ or draw the troops within the walls of troy
thus while he thought beside him phoebus stood in asius shape who reigned by sangar flood thy brother hecuba from dymas sprung a valiant warrior haughty bold and young
thus he accosts him what a shameful sight god is it stern_hector that forbears the fight were thine my vigour
this successful spear should soon convince thee of so false a fear turn thee ah turn thee to the field of fame and in patroclus blood efface thy shame
perhaps apollo shall thy arms succeed and heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed so spoke the inspiring god then took his flight and plunged amidst the tumult of the fight
he bids cebrion drive the rapid car the lash resounds the coursers rush to war the god the grecians sinking souls depress and pour swift spirits through each trojan breast
patroclus lights impatient for the fight a spear his left a stone employs his right with all his nerves he drives it at the foe
pointed above and rough and gross below the falling ruin crush cebrion head the lawless offspring of king priam bed his front brows eyes one undistinguish wound
the bursting balls drop sightless to the ground the charioteer while yet he held the rein struck from the car falls headlong on the plain
to the dark shades the soul unwilling glides while the proud victor thus his fall derides good heaven what active feats yon artist shows
what skilful divers are our phrygian foes mark with what ease they sink into the sand pity that all their practice is by land
then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize to spoil the carcase fierce patroclus flies swift as a lion terrible and bold
that sweeps the field depopulates the fold pierced through the dauntless heart then tumbles slain and from his fatal courage finds his bane
thus for some slaughter hind with equal rage two lordly rulers of the wood engage stung with fierce hunger each the prey invades and echoing roars rebellow through the shades
stern_hector fastens on the warrior head and by the foot patroclus drags the dead while all around confusion rage and fright mix the contending hosts in mortal fight
at once bold stern_hector leaping from his car defends the body and provokes the war so pent by hills the wild winds roar aloud
in the deep bosom of some gloomy wood leaves arms and trees aloft in air are blown the broad oaks crackle and the sylvans groan this way and that the rattling thicket bends and the whole forest in one crash descends
on darts now round the carcase ring now flights of arrows bounding from the string stones follow stones some clatter on the fields some hard and heavy shake the sounding shields
not with less noise with less tumultuous rage in dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage darts shower but where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains and
now flaming from the zenith sol had driven his fervid orb through half the vault of heaven while on each host with equal tempests fell the showering darts and numbers sank to hell
stretch in death forgets the guiding reins but when his evening wheels erhung the main glad conquest rested on the grecian train
then from amidst the tumult and alarms they draw the conquer corse and radiant arms then rash patroclus with new fury glows and breathing slaughter pours amid the foes
thrice on the press like mars himself he flew and thrice three heroes at each onset slew there end thy glory
there the fate untwine the last black remnant of so bright a line apollo dreadful stops thy middle way death calls and heaven allows no longer day
for lo the god in dusky clouds enshrined approaching dealt a staggering blow behind the weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel his eyes flash sparkles his stunn senses reel
in giddy darkness far to distance flung his bounding helmet on the champaign rung achilles plume is stain with dust and gore
that plume which never stoop to earth before long used untouch in fighting fields to shine and shade the temples of the mad divine
which_jove dooms it now on stern_hector helm to nod not long for fate pursues him and the god his spear in shivers falls his ample shield drops from his arm his baldric strows the field
loose is each joint each nerve with horror shakes stupid he stares and all assistless stands such is the force of more than mortal hands
the corslet his astonish breast forsakes a dardan youth there was well known to fame from panthus sprung euphorbus was his name
famed for the manage of the foaming horse skill in the dart and matchless in the course full twenty knights he tumbled from the car
while yet he learn his rudiments of war his venturous spear first drew the hero gore he struck he wounded but he durst no more
nor though disarm patroclus fury stood but swift withdrew the long protended wood and turn him short and herded in the crowd
thus by an arm divine and mortal spear wounded at once patroclus yields to fear retires for succour to his social train and flies the fate which heaven decreed in vain
stern_hector as the bleeding chief he views breaks through the ranks and his retreat pursues the lance arrests him with a mortal wound he falls earth thunders and his arms resound
so scorch with heat along the desert score the roaming lion meets a bristly boar fast by the spring they both dispute the flood with flaming eyes and jaws besmear with blood at length the sovereign savage wins the strife and the torn boar resigns his thirst and life
with him all greece was sunk that moment all her yet surviving heroes seem to fall patroclus thus so many chiefs erthrown so many lives effused expires his own
as dying now at stern_hector feet he lies he sternly views him and triumphant cries lie there patroclus and with thee the joy thy pride once promised of subverting troy the fancied scenes of ilion wrapt in flames and thy soft pleasures served with captive dames
unthinking man i fought those towers to free and guard that beauteous race from lords like thee but thou a prey to vultures shalt be made thy own achilles cannot lend thee aid
though much at parting that great chief might say and much enjoin thee this important day return not my brave friend perhaps he said without the bloody arms of stern_hector dead
he spoke patroclus march and thus he sped supine and wildly gazing on the skies with faint expiring breath the chief replies vain boaster
cease and know the powers divine which_jove and apollo is this deed not thine to heaven is owed whate er your own you call and
heaven itself disarm me ere my fall had twenty mortals each thy match in might opposed me fairly they had sunk in fight
by fate and phoebus was i first erthrown euphorbus next the third mean part thy own but thou imperious hear my latest breath
insulting man thou shalt be soon as i black fate erhangs thee and thy hour draws nigh even now on life last verge i see thee stand i see thee fall and by achilles hand
the gods inspire it and it sounds thy death he faints the soul unwilling wings her way the beauteous body left a load of clay
then stern_hector pausing as his eyes he fed on the pale carcase thus address the dead from whence this boding speech the stern_hector decree of death denounced or why denounced to me
flits to the lone uncomfortable coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost why not as well achilles fate be given to stern_hector lance
pensive he said then pressing as he lay his breathless bosom tore the lance away and upwards cast the corse the reeking spear he shakes and charge the bold charioteer
but swift automedon with loosen reins rapt in the chariot er the distant plains far from his rage the immortal coursers drove the immortal coursers were the gift of which_jove
who knows the will of heaven illustration ćsculapius ćsculapius book xvii argument the seventh battle for the body of patroclus the acts of great_menelaus
great_menelaus upon the death of patroclus defends his body from the enemy euphorbus who attempts it is slain stern_hector advancing great_menelaus retires but soon returns with oilean_ajax and drives him off
this glaucus objects to stern_hector as a flight who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from patroclus and renews the battle
the greeks give way till oilean_ajax rallies them aeneas sustains the trojans aeneas and stern_hector attempt the chariot of achilles which is borne off by automedon
the horses of achilles deplore the loss of patroclus jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness the noble prayer of oilean_ajax on that occasion
great_menelaus sends antilochus to achilles with the news of patroclus death then returns to the fight where though attacked with the utmost fury he and meriones assisted by the ajaces bear off the body to the ships
the time is the evening of the eight and twentieth day the scene lies in the fields before troy on the cold earth divine patroclus spread
lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead great_menelaus touch with generous woe springs to the front and guards him from the foe
thus round her new fallen young the heifer moves fruit of her throes and first born of her loves and anxious helpless as he lies and bare
turns and re turns her with a mother care opposed to each that near the carcase came his broad shield glimmers and his lances flame
the son of panthus skill the dart to send eyes the dead hero and insults the friend this hand atrides laid patroclus low warrior desist nor tempt an equal blow
to me the spoil my prowess won resign depart with life and leave the glory mine the trojan thus the spartan monarch burn d
with generous anguish and in scorn return laugh st thou not which_jove from thy superior throne when mortals boast of prowess not their own
not thus the lion glories in his might nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight nor thus the boar those terrors of the plain man only vaunts his force and vaunts in vain
but far the vainest of the boastful kind these son of panthus vent their haughty mind yet twas but late beneath my conquering steel
this boaster brother hyperenor fell against our arm which rashly he defied vain was his vigour and as vain his pride
these eyes beheld him on the dust expire no more to cheer his spouse or glad his sire presumptuous youth like his shall be thy doom go wait thy brother to the stygian gloom
or while thou may st avoid the threaten fate fools stay to feel it and are wise_nestor too late unmoved euphorbus thus that action known come for my brother blood repay thy own
his weeping father claims thy destined head and spouse a widow in her bridal bed on these thy conquer spoil i shall bestow
to soothe a consort and a parent woe no longer then defer the glorious strife let heaven decide our fortune fame and life
swift as the word the missile lance he flings the well aim weapon on the buckler rings but blunted by the brass innoxious falls
great atrides calls nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain it pierced his throat and bent him to the plain wide through the neck appears the grisly wound prone sinks the warrior and his arms resound
the shining circlets of his golden hair which even the graces might be proud to wear instarr with gems and gold bestrow the shore with dust dishonour and deform with gore
as the young olive in some sylvan scene crown by fresh fountains with eternal green lifts the gay head in snowy flowerets fair and plays and dances to the gentle air
a whirlwind from high heaven invades the tender plant and withers all its shades it lies uprooted from its genial bed a lovely ruin now defaced and dead thus young thus beautiful euphorbus lay while the fierce spartan tore his arms away
on which_jove the father when lo proud of his deed and glorious in the prize affrighted troy the towering victor flies
flies as before some mountain lion ire the village curs and trembling swains retire when er the slaughter bull they hear him roar and see his jaws distil with smoking gore all pale with fear at distance scatter round
and urged great stern_hector to dispute the prize in mentes shape beneath whose martial care the rough ciconians learn the trade of war
forbear he cried with fruitless speed to chase achilles coursers of ethereal race they stoop not these to mortal man command or stoop to none but great achilles hand
too long amused with a pursuit so vain turn and behold the brave euphorbus slain by sparta slain for ever now
they shout incessant and the vales resound meanwhile apollo view with envious eyes suppress the fire which burn in that undaunted breast
thus having spoke apollo wing his flight and mix with mortals in the toils of fight his word infix unutterable care
deep in great stern_hector soul through all the war he darts his anxious eye and instant view the breathless hero in his blood imbued forth welling from the wound as prone he lay
and in the victor hands the shining prey sheath in bright arms through cleaving ranks he flies and sends his voice in thunder to the skies
fierce as a flood of flame by vulcan sent it flew and fired the nations as it went atrides from the voice the storm divined and thus explored his own unconquer mind
then shall i quit patroclus on the plain slain in my cause and for my honour slain desert the arms the relics of my friend
or singly stern_hector and his troops attend sure where such partial favour heaven bestow to brave the hero were to brave the god
forgive me greece if once i quit the field tis not to stern_hector but to heaven i yield yet nor the god nor heaven should give me fear
the voice of oilean_ajax reach my ear still would we turn still battle on the plains and give achilles all that yet remains of his and our patroclus
did but this no more the time allow troy thicken on the shore a sable scene the terrors stern_hector led
so from the fold the unwilling lion parts forced by loud clamours and a storm of darts he flies indeed but threatens as he flies with heart indignant and retorted eyes
now enter in the spartan ranks he turn his manly breast and with new fury burn o er all the black battalions sent his view and through the cloud the godlike oilean_ajax knew where labouring on the left the warrior stood
all grim in arms and cover o er with blood there breathing courage where the god of day had sunk each heart with terror and dismay
slow he recedes and sighing quits the dead to him the king oh oilean_ajax oh my friend haste and patroclus loved remains defend
the body to achilles to restore demand our care alas we can no more for naked now despoiled of arms he lies
and stern_hector glories in the dazzling prize he said and touch his heart the raging pair pierced the thick battle and provoke the war
already had stern_hector seized his head and doom to trojan gods the unhappy dead but soon as oilean_ajax rear his tower like shield sprung to his car and measured back the field his train to troy the radiant armour bear to stand a trophy of his fame in war
meanwhile great oilean_ajax his broad shield display guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade and now before and now behind he stood
thus in the centre of some gloomy wood with many a step the lioness surrounds her tawny young beset by men and hounds elate her heart and rousing all her powers dark er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours
but glaucus leader of the lycian aids on stern_hector frowning thus his flight upbraids where now in stern_hector shall we stern_hector find
fast by his side the generous spartan glows with great revenge and feeds his inward woes a manly form without a manly mind
since battle is renounced thy thought employ what other methods may preserve thy troy tis time to try if ilion state can stand by thee alone nor ask a foreign hand
is this chief a hero boasted fame how vain without the merit is the name mean empty boast but shall the lycians stake their lives for you
those lycians you forsake what from thy thankless arms can we expect thy friend sarpedon proves thy base neglect say shall our slaughter bodies guard your walls
while unreveng the great sarpedon falls even where he died for troy you left him there a feast for dogs and all the fowls of air
did such a spirit as the gods impart impel one trojan hand or trojan heart such as should burn in every soul that draws the sword for glory and his country cause
on my command if any lycian wait hence let him march and give up troy to fate even yet our mutual arms we might employ and drag yon carcase to the walls of troy
oh were patroclus ours we might obtain sarpedon arms and honour corse again greece with achilles friend should be repaid and thus due honours purchased to his shade
but word are vain let oilean_ajax once appear and stern_hector trembles and recedes with fear thou dar st not meet the terrors of his eye
the trojan chief with fix resentment eyed the lycian leader and sedate replied say is it just my friend that stern_hector ear from such a warrior such a speech should hear
and lo already thou prepar st to fly i deem thee once the wisest of thy kind but ill this insult suits a prudent mind
i shun great oilean_ajax i desert my train tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain i joy to mingle where the battle bleeds and hear the thunder of the sounding steeds
but which_jove high will is ever uncontroll the strong he withers and confounds the bold now crowns with fame the mighty man and now strikes the fresh garland from the victor brow
come through yon squadrons let us hew the way and thou be witness if i fear to day if yet a greek the sight of stern_hector dread or yet their hero dare defend the dead
then turning to the martial hosts he cries ye trojans dardans lycians and allies be men my friends in action as in name and yet be mindful of your ancient fame
stern_hector in proud achilles arms shall shine torn from his friend by right of conquest mine he strode along the field as thus he said the sable plumage nodded er his head
swift through the spacious plain he sent a look one instant saw one instant overtook the distant band that on the sandy shore the radiant spoil to sacred ilion bore
there his own mail unbraced the field bestrow his train to troy convey the massy load now blazing in the immortal arms he stands
the work and present of celestial hands by aged peleus to achilles given as first to peleus by the court of heaven his father arms not long achilles wears forbid by fate to reach his father years
him proud in triumph glittering from afar the god whose thunder rends the troubled air beheld with pity as apart he sat
and conscious look through all the scene of fate he shook the sacred honours of his head olympus trembled and the godhead said
in heavenly panoply divinely bright thou stand st and armies tremble at thy sight as at achilles self beneath thy dart lies slain the great achilles dearer part
ah wretched man unmindful of thy end a moment glory and what fate attend thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn which once the greatest of mankind had worn
no more andromache shall come with joyful tears to welcome stern_hector home no more officious with endearing charms from thy tired limbs unbrace pelides arms
yet live i give thee one illustrious day a blaze of glory ere thou fad st away for ah then with his sable brow he gave the nod that seals his word the sanction of the god
fill with the god enlarged his members grew through all his veins a sudden vigour flew the blood in brisker tides began to roll and mars himself came rushing on his soul
the stubborn arms by which_jove command disposed conform spontaneous and around him closed exhorting loud through all the field he strode and look and moved achilles or a god
now mesthles glaucus medon he inspires now phorcys chromius and hippothous fires the great thersilochus like fury found asteropaeus kindled at the sound and ennomus in augury renown
hear all ye hosts and hear unnumber bands of neighbouring nations or of distant lands twas not for state we summon you so far
to boast our numbers and the pomp of war ye came to fight a valiant foe to chase to save our present and our future race
tor this our wealth our products you enjoy and glean the relics of exhausted troy now then to conquer or to die prepare to die or conquer are the terms of war
whatever hand shall win patroclus slain whoe er shall drag him to the trojan train with stern_hector self shall equal honours claim with stern_hector part the spoil and share the fame
fired by his word the troops dismiss their fears they join they thicken they protend their spears full on the greeks they drive in firm array and each from oilean_ajax hopes the glorious prey
vain hope what numbers shall the field erspread what victims perish round the mighty dead great oilean_ajax mark the growing storm from far and thus bespoke his brother of the war
our fatal day alas is come my friend and all our wars and glories at an end tis not this corse alone
we guard in vain condemn to vultures on the trojan plain we too must yield the same sad fate must fall on thee on me perhaps my friend on all
see what a tempest direful stern_hector spreads and lo it bursts it thunders on our heads call on our greeks if any hear the call
the bravest greeks this hour demand them all the warrior raised his voice and wide around the field re echoed the distressful sound
chiefs princes to whose hand is given the rule of men whose glory is from heaven whom with due honours both atrides grace
all whom this well known voice shall reach from far all whom i see not through this cloud of war come all
ye guides and guardians of our argive race let generous rage your arms employ and save patroclus from the dogs of troy
oilean_ajax first the voice obey swift was his pace and ready was his aid next him idomeneus more slow with age and
merion burning with a hero rage the long succeeding numbers who can name but all were greeks and eager all for fame
fierce to the charge great stern_hector led the throng whole troy embodied rush with shouts along thus when a mountain billow foams and raves where some swoln river disembogues his waves
full in the mouth is stopp the rushing tide the boiling ocean works from side to side the river trembles to his utmost shore and distant rocks re bellow to the roar
which_jove pouring darkness er the mingled fight conceals the warriors shining helms in night to him the chief for whom the hosts contend had lived not hateful for he lived a friend
nor less resolved the firm achaian band with brazen shields in horrid circle stand dead he protects him with superior care
nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air illustration fight for the body of patroclus fight for the body of patroclus
the first attack the grecians scarce sustain repulsed they yield the trojans seize the slain then fierce they rally to revenge led on by the swift rage of oilean_ajax ajax_telamon
with headlong force the foremost ranks he tore so through the thicket bursts the mountain boar and rudely scatters for a distance round the frighted hunter and the baying hound
the son of lethus brave pelasgus heir hippothous dragg the carcase through the war the sinewy ankles bored the feet he bound with thongs inserted through the double wound inevitable fate ertakes the deed doom by great oilean_ajax vengeful lance to bleed it cleft the helmet brazen cheeks in twain the shatter crest and horse hair strow the plain
with nerves relax he tumbles to the ground the brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound he drops patroclus foot and er him spread now lies a sad companion of the dead far from larissa lies his native air and ill requites his parents tender care
oilean_ajax to peleus son the second name in graceful stature next and next in fame lamented youth in life first bloom he fell sent by great oilean_ajax to the shades of hell
once more at oilean_ajax stern_hector javelin flies the grecian marking as it cut the skies shunn the descending death which hissing on stretch in the dust
the boldest warrior and the noblest mind in little panope for strength renown he held his seat and ruled the realms around
plunged in his throat the weapon drank his blood and deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood in clanging arms the hero fell and all the fields resounded with his weighty fall
the telamonian lance his belly rends the hollow armour burst before the stroke and through the wound the rushing entrails broke
the great iphytus son schedius the brave of all the phocian kind phorcys as slain hippothous he defends in strong convulsions panting on the sands he lies and grasps the dust with dying hands
struck at the sight recede the trojan train the shouting argives strip the heroes slain and now had troy by greece compell to yield
fled to her ramparts and resign the field greece in her native fortitude elate with which_jove averse had turn the scale of fate
but phoebus urged ćneas to the fight he seem like aged periphas to sight a herald in anchises love grown old revered for prudence and with prudence bold
there have been heroes who by virtuous care by valour numbers and by arts of war have forced the powers to spare a sinking state and gain at length the glorious odds of fate
but you when fortune smiles when which_jove declares his partial favour and assists your wars your shameful efforts gainst yourselves employ and force the unwilling god to ruin troy
thus he what methods yet chief remain to save your troy though heaven its fall ordain ćneas through the form assumed descries the power conceal and thus to stern_hector cries oh lasting shame
to our own fears a prey we seek our ramparts and desert the day a god nor is he less my bosom warms and tells me which_jove asserts the trojan arms
he spoke and foremost to the combat flew the bold example all his hosts pursue then first leocritus beneath him bled
in vain beloved by valiant lycomede who view his fall and grieving at the chance swift to revenge it sent his angry lance the whirling lance with vigorous force address descends and pants in apisaon breast from rich paeonia vales the warrior came
asteropeus with grief beheld the slain and rush to combat but he rush in vain indissolubly firm around the dead rank within rank on buckler buckler spread and hemm with bristled spears the grecians stood
next thee asteropeus in place and fame a brazen bulwark and an iron wood great oilean_ajax eyes them with incessant care
and stands the centre and the soul of all fix on the spot they war and wounded wound a sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground on heaps the greeks on heaps the trojans bled and thickening round them rise the hills of dead
greece in close order and collected might yet suffers least and sways the wavering fight fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns and now it rise now it sinks by turns
in one thick darkness all the fight was lost the sun the moon and all the ethereal host seem as extinct day ravish from their eyes and all heaven splendours blotted from the skies
and in an orb contracts the crowded war close in their ranks commands to fight or fall such er patroclus body hung the night
no vapour rested on the mountain head the golden sun pour forth a stronger ray and all the broad expansion flamed with day
the rest in sunshine fought and open light unclouded there the aerial azure spread dispersed around the plain by fits they fight
and here and there their scatter arrows light but death and darkness er the carcase spread there burn the war and there the mighty bled
meanwhile the son of wise_nestor in the rear their fellows routed toss the distant spear and skirmish wide so wise_nestor gave command when from the ships he sent the pylian band
the youthful brothers thus for fame contend nor knew the fortune of achilles friend in thought they view him still with martial joy glorious in arms and dealing death to troy
but round the corse the heroes pant for breath and thick and heavy grows the work of death erlabour now with dust and sweat and gore their knees their legs their feet are covered er drops follow drops the clouds on clouds arise and carnage clogs their hands and darkness fills their eyes
as when a slaughter bull yet reeking hide strain with full force and tugg from side to side the brawny curriers stretch and labour er
the extended surface drunk with fat and gore so tugging round the corse both armies stood the mangled body bathed in sweat and blood while greeks and ilians equal strength employ now to the ships to force it now to troy
not pallas self her breast when fury warms nor he whose anger sets the world in arms could blame this scene such rage such horror reign such which_jove to honour the great dead ordain
achilles in his ships at distance lay nor knew the fatal fortune of the day he yet unconscious of patroclus fall in dust extended under ilion wall expects him glorious from the conquered plain and for his wish return prepares in vain though well he knew to make proud ilion bend was more than heaven had destined to his friend
perhaps to him this thetis had reveal the rest in pity to her son conceal still raged the conflict round the hero dead and heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled
cursed be the man even private greeks would say who dares desert this well disputed day first may the cleaving earth before our eyes gape wide and drink our blood for sacrifice first perish all ere
haughty troy shall boast we lost patroclus and our glory lost thus they while with one voice the trojans said grant this day which_jove or heap us on the dead
meantime at distance from the scene of blood the pensive steeds of great achilles stood their godlike master slain before their eyes they wept and shared in human miseries
in vain automedon now shakes the rein now plies the lash and soothes and threats in vain nor to the fight nor hellespont they go
restive they stood and obstinate in woe still as a tombstone never to be moved on some good man or woman unreproved lays its eternal weight or fix as stands a marble courser by the sculptor hands placed on the hero grave
then clash their sounding arms the clangours rise and shake the brazen concave of the skies along their face the big round drops coursed down with silent pace conglobing on the dust
their manes that late circled their arched necks and waved in state trail on the dust beneath the yoke were spread and prone to earth was hung their languid head nor which_jove disdain to cast a pitying look
while thus relenting to the steeds he spoke unhappy coursers of immortal strain exempt from age and deathless now in vain
what is there of inferior birth that breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth what wretched creature of what wretched kind than man more weak calamitous and blind
did we your race on mortal man bestow only alas to share in mortal woe for ah a miserable race but cease to mourn
for not by you shall priam son be borne high on the splendid car one glorious prize he rashly boasts the rest our will denies
ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart ourself with rising spirits swell your heart automedon your rapid flight shall bear safe to the navy through the storm of war
for yet tis given to troy to ravage er the field and spread her slaughters to the shore the sun shall see her conquer till his fall with sacred darkness shades the face of all
he said and breathing in the immortal horse excessive spirit urged them to the course from their high manes they shake the dust and bear the kindling chariot through the parted war so flies a vulture through the clamorous train of geese that scream and scatter round the plain
from danger now with swiftest speed they flew and now to conquest with like speed pursue sole in the seat the charioteer remains now plies the javelin now directs the reins
him brave alcimedon beheld distress approach the chariot and the chief address what god provokes thee rashly thus to dare alone unaided in the thickest war
alas thy friend is slain and stern_hector wields achilles arms triumphant in the fields in happy time the charioteer replies
the bold alcimedon now greets my eyes no greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains or holds their fury in suspended reins
patroclus while he lived their rage could tame but now patroclus is an empty name to thee i yield the seat to thee resign
the ruling charge the task of fight be mine he said alcimedon with active heat snatches the reins and vaults into the seat
his friend descends the chief of troy descried and call ćneas fighting near his side lo to my sight beyond our hope restored achilles car deserted of its lord
the glorious steeds our ready arms invite scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight can such opponents stand when we assail
the son of venus to the counsel yields then er their backs they spread their solid shields with brass refulgent the broad surface shined and thick bull hides the spacious concave lined
them chromius follows aretus succeeds each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds in vain brave youths with glorious hopes ye burn in vain advance
unite thy force my friend and we prevail not fated to return unmov automedon attends the fight implores the eternal and collects his might
full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow for hard the fight determined is the foe tis stern_hector comes and when he seeks the prize war knows no mean he wins it or he dies
then turning to his friend with dauntless mind oh keep the foaming coursers close behind then through the field he sends his voice aloud and calls the ajaces from the warring crowd with great atrides
turn where distress demand immediate aid the dead encircled by his friends forego and save the living from a fiercer foe
hither turn he said unhelp we stand unequal to engage the force of stern_hector and ćneas rage yet mighty as they are my force to prove is only mine the event belongs to which_jove
he spoke and high the sounding javelin flung which pass the shield of aretus the young it pierced his belt emboss with curious art then in the lower belly struck the dart
as when a ponderous axe descending full cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull struck twixt the horns he springs with many a bound
then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground thus fell the youth the air his soul received and the spear trembled as his entrails heaved
now at automedon the trojan foe discharged his lance the meditated blow stooping he shunn the javelin idly fled and hiss innoxious er the hero head deep rooted in the ground the forceful spear in long vibrations spent its fury there
with clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed but each brave oilean_ajax heard and interposed nor longer stern_hector with his trojans stood but left their slain companion in his blood his arms automedon divests and cries accept patroclus this mean sacrifice thus have i soothed my griefs and thus have paid poor as it is some offering to thy shade
so looks the lion er a mangled boar all grim with rage and horrible with gore high on the chariot at one bound he sprung and er his seat the bloody trophies hung
and now minerva from the realms of air descends impetuous and renews the war for pleased at length the grecian arms to aid the lord of thunders sent the blue eyed maid
as when high which_jove denouncing future woe er the dark clouds extends his purple bow in sign of tempests from the troubled air or from the rage of man destructive war the drooping cattle dread the impending skies and from his half till field the labourer flies in such a form the goddess round her drew a livid cloud and to the battle flew
assuming phoenix shape on earth she falls and in his well known voice to sparta calls and lies achilles friend beloved by all a prey to dogs beneath the trojan wall
what shame greece for future times to tell to thee the greatest in whose cause he fell chief father
atreus son replies full of days by long experience wise_nestor what more desires my soul than here unmoved to guard the body of the man i loved
ah would minerva send me strength to rear this wearied arm and ward the storm of war but stern_hector like the rage of fire we dread and which_jove own glories blaze around his head
pleased to be first of all the powers address she breathes new vigour in her hero breast and fills with keen revenge with fell despite desire of blood and rage and lust of fight
so burns the vengeful hornet soul all er repulsed in vain and thirsty still of gore bold son of air and heat on angry wings untamed untired he turns attacks and stings
fired with like ardour fierce atrides flew and sent his soul with every lance he threw there stood a trojan not unknown to fame aetion son and podes was his name
with riches honour and with courage bless by stern_hector loved his comrade and his guest through his broad belt the spear a passage found and ponderous as he falls his arms resound
sudden at stern_hector side apollo stood like phaenops asius son appear the god asius the great who held his wealthy reign in fair abydos by the rolling main
oh prince he cried oh foremost once in fame what grecian now shall tremble at thy name dost thou at length to great_menelaus yield a chief once thought no terror of the field
yet singly now the long disputed prize he bears victorious while our army flies by the same arm illustrious podes bled the friend of stern_hector unrevenged is dead
this heard er stern_hector spreads a cloud of woe rage lifts his lance and drives him on the foe but now the eternal shook his sable shield that shaded ide and all the subject field beneath its ample verge
a rolling cloud involved the mount the thunder roar aloud the affrighted hills from their foundations nod and blaze beneath the lightnings of the god at one regard of his all seeing eye
then trembled greece the flight peneleus led for as the brave boeotian turn his head to face the foe polydamas drew near and razed his shoulder with a shorten spear
by stern_hector wounded leitus quits the plain pierced through the wrist and raging with the pain grasps his once formidable lance in vain
as stern_hector follow idomen address the flaming javelin to his manly breast the brittle point before his corslet yields exulting troy with clamour fills the fields high on his chariots the cretan stood the son of priam whirl the massive wood
but erring from its aim the impetuous spear struck to the dust the squire and charioteer of martial merion coeranus his name who left fair lyctus for the fields of fame
the vanquish triumph and the victors fly on foot bold merion fought and now laid low had graced the triumphs of his trojan foe
but the brave squire the ready coursers brought and with his life his master safety bought between his cheek and ear the weapon went
prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain his dying hand forgets the falling rein this merion reaches bending from the car and urges to desert the hopeless war
the teeth it shatter and the tongue it rent idomeneus consents the lash applies and the swift chariot to the navy flies
not oilean_ajax less the will of heaven descried and conquest shifting to the trojan side turn by the hand of which_jove
then thus begun to atreus seed the godlike ajax_telamon alas who sees not which_jove almighty hand transfers the glory to the trojan band
whether the weak or strong discharge the dart he guides each arrow to a grecian heart not so our spears incessant though they rain he suffers every lance to fall in vain
deserted of the god yet let us try what human strength and prudence can supply if yet this honour corse in triumph borne may glad the fleets that hope not our return who tremble yet scarce rescued from their fate and still hear stern_hector thundering at their gates
some hero too must be despatch to bear the mournful message to pelides ear for sure he knows not distant on the shore his friend his loved patroclus is no more
but such a chief i spy not through the host the men the steeds the armies all are lost in general darkness lord of earth and air
dispel this cloud the light of heaven restore give me to see and oilean_ajax asks no more if greece must perish we thy will obey
oh king oh father hear my humble prayer but let us perish in the face of day with tears the hero spoke and at his prayer
the god relenting clear the clouded air forth burst the sun with all enlightening ray the blaze of armour flash against the day
now now atrides cast around thy sight if yet antilochus survives the fight let him to great achilles ear convey
so turns the lion from the nightly fold though high in courage and with hunger bold long gall by herdsmen and long vex by hounds stiff with fatigue and fretted sore with wounds the darts fly round him from a hundred hands and the red terrors of the blazing brands till late reluctant at the dawn of day
sour he departs and quits the untasted prey so moved atrides from his dangerous place with weary limbs but with unwilling pace the foe he fear might yet patroclus gain and much admonish much adjured his train guard these relics to your charge consign and bear the merits of the dead in mind how skill he was in each obliging art the mildest manners and the gentlest heart
the fatal news atrides hastes away he was alas but fate decreed his end in death a hero as in life a friend
as the bold bird endued with sharpest eye of all that wings the mid aerial sky the sacred eagle from his walks above looks down and sees the distant thicket move then stoops and sousing on the quivering hare snatches his life amid the clouds of air
not with less quickness his exerted sight pass this and that way through the ranks of fight till on the left the chief he sought he found cheering his men and spreading deaths around
so parts the chief from rank to rank he flew and round on all sides sent his piercing view to him the king
beloved of which_jove draw near for sadder tidings never touch thy ear thy eyes have witness what a fatal turn how ilion triumphs and the achaians mourn
fly to the fleet this instant fly and tell the sad achilles how his loved one fell he too may haste the naked corse to gain the arms are stern_hector who despoil the slain
this is not all patroclus on the shore now pale and dead shall succour greece no more the youthful warrior heard with silent woe from his fair eyes the tears began to flow
big with the mighty grief he strove to say what sorrow dictates but no word found way to brave laodocus his arms he flung
who near him wheeling drove his steeds along then ran the mournful message to impart with tearful eyes and with dejected heart
swift fled the youth nor great_menelaus stands though sore distress to aid the pylian bands but bids bold thrasymede those troops sustain himself returns to his patroclus slain
gone is antilochus the hero said but hope not warriors for achilles aid though fierce his rage unbounded be his woe unarm he fights not with the trojan foe
tis in our hands alone our hopes remain tis our own vigour must the dead regain and save ourselves while with impetuous hate troy pours along and this way rolls our fate
tis well said oilean_ajax be it then thy care with merion aid the weighty corse to rear myself and my bold brother will sustain the shock of stern_hector and his charging train
nor fear we armies fighting side by side what troy can dare we have already tried have tried it and have stood
the hero said high from the ground the warriors heave the dead a general clamour rise at the sight loud shout the trojans and renew the fight
not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood with rage insatiate and with thirst of blood voracious hounds that many a length before their furious hunters drive the wounded boar but if the savage turns his glaring eye they howl aloof and round the forest fly
thus on retreating greece the trojans pour wave their thick falchions and their javelins shower but oilean_ajax turning to their fears they yield
while thus aloft the hero corse they bear behind them rages all the storm of war confusion tumult horror er the throng of men steeds chariots urged the rout along
less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire to whelm some city under waves of fire now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes now crack the blazing temples of the gods
all pale they tremble and forsake the field the rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls and sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles
as when two mules along the rugged road from the steep mountain with exerted strength drag some vast beam or mast unwieldy length inly they groan big drops of sweat distil the enormous timber lumbering down the hill
the heroes sweat beneath their honour load so these behind the bulk of oilean_ajax stands and breaks the torrent of the rushing bands
thus when a river swell with sudden rains spreads his broad waters er the level plains some interposing hill the stream divides
and breaks its force and turns the winding tides still close they follow close the rear engage aeneas storms and stern_hector foams with rage
while greece a heavy thick retreat maintains wedged in one body like a flight of cranes that shriek incessant while the falcon hung high on poised pinions threats their callow young
so from the trojan chiefs the grecians fly such the wild terror and the mingled cry within without the trench and all the way strow in bright heaps their arms and armour lay
such horror which_jove impress yet still proceeds the work of death and still the battle bleeds illustration vulcan from an antique gem
vulcan from an antique gem book xviii argument the grief of achilles and new armour made him by vulcan the news of the death of patroclus is brought to achilles by antilochus
thetis hearing his lamentations comes with all her sea nymphs to comfort him the speeches of the mother and son on this occasion
iris appears to achilles by the command of juno and orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments
the sight of him turns the fortune of the day and the body of patroclus is carried off by the greeks
the trojans call a council where stern_hector and polydamas disagree in their opinions but the advice of the former prevails to remain encamped in the field
the grief of achilles over the body of patroclus thetis goes to the palace of vulcan to obtain new arms for her son
the latter part of the nine and twentieth day and the night ensuing take up this book the scene is at achilles tent on the sea shore from whence it changes to the palace of vulcan
the description of the wonderful works of vulcan and lastly that noble one of the shield of achilles thus like the rage of fire the combat burns
meanwhile where hellespont broad waters flow stood wise_nestor son the messenger of woe there sat achilles shaded by his sails on hoisted yards extended to the gales pensive he sat for all that fate design rose in sad prospect to his boding mind
and now it rise now it sinks by turns thus to his soul he said ah what constrains the greeks late victors now to quit the plains
is this the day which heaven so long ago ordain to sink me with the weight of woe so thetis warn when by a trojan hand
the bravest of the myrmidonian band should lose the light fulfilled is that decree fallen is the warrior and patroclus he
in vain i charged him soon to quit the plain and warn to shun hectorean force in vain thus while he thinks antilochus appears and tells the melancholy tale with tears
sad tidings son of peleus thou must hear and wretched i the unwilling messenger dead is patroclus for his corse they fight his naked corse his arms are stern_hector right
cast on the ground with furious hands he spread the scorching ashes er his graceful head his purple garments and his golden hairs those he deforms with dust and these he tears on the hard soil his groaning breast he threw and roll and grovell as to earth he grew
the virgin captives with disorder charms won by his own or by patroclus arms rush from their tents with cries and gathering round beat their white breasts and fainted on the ground
a sudden horror shot through all the chief and wrapp his senses in the cloud of grief while wise_nestor son sustains a manlier part and mourns the warrior with a warrior heart
hangs on his arms amidst his frantic woe and oft prevents the meditated blow far in the deep abysses of the main
with hoary nereus and the watery train the mother goddess from her crystal throne heard his loud cries and answer groan for groan
thalia glauce every watery name nesaea mild and silver spio came cymothoe and cymodoce were nigh and the blue languish of soft alia eye
their locks actaea and limnoria rear then proto doris panope appear thoa pherusa doto melita agave gentle and amphithoe gay next callianira callianassa show their sister looks dexamene the slow and swift dynamene now cut the tides iaera now the verdant wave divides
nemertes with apseudes lifts the head bright galatea quits her pearly bed these orythia clymene attend maera amphinome the train extend and black janira and janassa fair and amatheia with her amber hair
all these and all that deep in ocean held their sacred seats the glimmering grotto fill each beat her ivory breast with silent woe
the circling nereids with their mistress weep and all the sea green sisters of the deep till thetis sorrows thus began to flow hear me and judge ye sisters of the main
how just a cause has thetis to complain how wretched were i mortal were my fate how more than wretched in the immortal state
sprung from my bed a godlike hero came the bravest far that ever bore the name like some fair olive by my careful hand he grew he flourish and adorn the land to troy
i sent him but the fate ordain he never never must return again so short a space the light of heaven to view so short alas and fill with anguish too
i cannot ease them but i must deplore i go at least to bear a tender part and mourn my loved one with a mother heart
hear how his sorrows echo through the shore she said and left the caverns of the main all bathed in tears the melancholy train attend her way
wide opening part the tides while the long pomp the silver wave divides approaching now they touch the trojan land then two by two ascended up the strand
the immortal mother standing close beside her mournful offspring to his sighs replied along the coast their mingled clamours ran and thus the silver footed dame began why mourns my son
thy late preferr request the god has granted and the greeks distress why mourns my son thy anguish let me share reveal the cause and trust a parent care
he deeply groaning to this cureless grief not even the thunderer favour brings relief patroclus ah say goddess can i boast a pleasure now
revenge itself is lost patroclus loved of all my martial train beyond mankind beyond myself is slain lost are those arms the gods themselves
cursed be that day when all the powers above thy charms submitted to a mortal love hadst thou still a sister of the main pursued the pleasures of the watery reign and happier peleus less ambitious led a mortal beauty to his equal bed
bestow on peleus stern_hector bears the glorious load ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb had caused such sorrows past and woes to come
for soon alas that wretched offspring slain new woes new sorrows shall create again tis not in fate the alternate now to give patroclus dead achilles hates to live
let me revenge it on proud stern_hector heart let his last spirit smoke upon my dart on these condition will i breathe till then i blush to walk among the race of men
a flood of tears at this the goddess shed ah then i see thee dying see thee dead when stern_hector falls thou diest let stern_hector die and let me fall
ah then since from this miserable day i cast all hope of my return away since unrevenged a hundred ghosts demand
the fate of stern_hector from achilles hand since here for brutal courage far renown i live an idle burden to the ground others in council famed for nobler skill more useful to preserve than i to kill let me
achilles made reply far lies patroclus from his native plain he fell and falling wish my aid in vain but oh
sweet to the soul as honey to the taste gathering like vapours of a noxious kind from fiery blood and darkening all the mind
ye gracious powers above wrath and revenge from men and gods remove far far too dear to every mortal breast me agamemnon urged to deadly hate tis past i quell it i resign to fate
yes i will meet the murderer of my friend or if the gods ordain it meet my end the stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun
the great alcides which_jove unequall son to juno hate at length resign his breath and sunk the victim of all conquering death
so shall achilles fall stretch pale and dead no more the grecian hope or trojan dread let me this instant rush into the fields and reap what glory life short harvest yields
shall i not force some widow dame to tear with frantic hands her long dishevell hair shall i not force her breast to heave with sighs and the soft tears to trickle from her eyes
yes i shall give the fair those mournful charms in vain you hold me hence my arms my arms soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide that all shall know achilles swells the tide
my son coerulean thetis made reply to fate submitting with a secret sigh the host to succour and thy friends to save is worthy thee the duty of the brave
but canst thou naked issue to the plains thy radiant arms the trojan foe detains insulting stern_hector bears the spoil on high but vainly glories for his fate is nigh
yet yet awhile thy generous ardour stay assured i meet thee at the dawn of day charged with refulgent arms a glorious load vulcanian arms the labour of a god
to your deeps descend haste and our father sacred seat attend i go to find the architect divine where vast olympus starry summits shine so tell our hoary sire this charge she gave the sea green sisters plunge beneath the wave
then turning to the daughters of the main the goddess thus dismiss her azure train ye sister nereids thetis once more ascends the bless abodes and treads the brazen threshold of the gods
and now the greeks from furious stern_hector force urge to broad hellespont their headlong course nor yet their chiefs patroclus body bore safe through the tempest to the tented shore
the horse the foot with equal fury join pour on the rear and thunder close behind and like a flame through fields of ripen corn the rage of stern_hector er the ranks was borne
thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew thrice to the skies the trojan clamours flew as oft the ajaces his assault sustain but check he turns repuls attacks again
with fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires nor yields a step nor from his post retires so watchful shepherds strive to force in vain
illustration thetis ordering the nereids to descend into the sea thetis ordering the nereids to descend into the sea the hungry lion from a carcase slain
even yet patroclus had he borne away and all the glories of the extended day had not high juno from the realms of air secret despatch her trusty messenger
the various goddess of the showery bow shot in a whirlwind to the shore below to great achilles at his ships she came and thus began the many colour dame
rise son of peleus rise divinely brave assist the combat and patroclus save for him the slaughter to the fleet they spread and fall by mutual wounds around the dead
to drag him back to troy the foe contends nor with his death the rage of stern_hector end a prey to dogs
he dooms the corse to lie and marks the place to fix his head on high rise and prevent if yet you think of fame
thy friend disgrace thy own eternal shame who sends thee goddess from the ethereal skies achilles thus and iris thus replies i come pelides from the queen of which_jove the immortal empress of the realms above
unknown to him who sits remote on high unknown to all the synod of the sky thou comest in vain he cries with fury warm
unwilling as i am of force i stay till thetis bring me at the dawn of day vulcanian arms what other can i wield except the mighty telamonian shield
that in my friend defence has oilean_ajax spread while his strong lance around him heaps the dead the gallant chief defends menoetius son and does what his achilles should have done
arms i have none and can i fight unarm thy want of arms said iris well we know but though unarm yet clad in terrors go
let but achilles er yon trench appear proud troy shall tremble and consent to fear greece from one glance of that tremendous eye shall take new courage and disdain to fly
the hero rose her aegis pallas er his shoulder throws around his brows a golden cloud she spread a stream of glory flamed above his head
as when from some beleaguer town arise the smokes high curling to the shaded skies seen from some island er the main afar when men distress hang out the sign of war
soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze with long projected beams the sea are bright and heaven high arch reflects the ruddy light
she spoke and pass in air so from achilles head the splendours rise reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies
forth march the chief and distant from the crowd high on the rampart raised his voice aloud with her own shout minerva swells the sound troy starts
as the loud trumpet brazen mouth from far with shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war struck from the walls the echoes float on high and the round bulwarks and thick towers reply so high his brazen voice the hero
astonish and the shores rebound rear hosts dropp their arms and trembled as they heard and back the chariots roll and coursers bound
and steeds and men lie mingled on the ground aghast they see the living lightnings play and turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray
thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised and thrice they fled confounded and amazed twelve in the tumult wedged untimely
rush on their own spears by their own chariots crush while shielded from the darts the greeks obtain the long contended carcase of the slain
a lofty bier the breathless warrior bears around his sad companions melt in tears but chief achilles bending down his head pours unavailing sorrows er the dead
whom late triumphant with his steeds and car he sent refulgent to the field of war unhappy change now senseless pale he found stretch forth and gash with many a gaping wound
meantime unwearied with his heavenly way in ocean waves the unwilling light of day quench his red orb at juno high command
and from their labours eased the achaian band the frighted trojans panting from the war their steeds unharness from the weary car
in haste and standing for to sit they fear twas now no season for prolong debate they saw achilles and in him their fate
polydamas at last skill to discern the future by the past the son of panthus thus express his fears the friend of stern_hector and of equal years the self same night to both a being gave one wise_nestor in council one in action brave illustration juno commanding the sun to set
in free debate my friends your sentence speak for me i move before the morning break to raise our camp too dangerous here our post far from troy walls and on a naked coast
a sudden council call each chief appear silent they stood juno commanding the sun to set i deem not greece so dreadful
while engaged in mutual feuds her king and hero raged then while we hoped our armies might prevail we boldly camp beside a thousand sail
i dread pelides now his rage of mind not long continues to the shores confined nor to the fields where long in equal fray contending nations won and lost the day for troy for troy shall henceforth be the strife and the hard contest not for fame but life
if but the morrow sun behold us here that arm those terrors we shall feel not fear and hearts that now disdain shall leap with joy if heaven permit them then to enter troy
haste then to ilion while the favouring night detains these terrors keeps that arm from fight let not my fatal prophecy be true nor what i tremble but to think ensue
whatever be our fate yet let us try what force of thought and reason can supply let us on counsel for our guard
depend the town her gates and bulwarks shall defend when morning dawns our well appointed powers array in arms shall line the lofty towers
let the fierce hero then when fury calls vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls or fetch a thousand circle round the plain till his spent coursers seek the fleet again so may his rage be tired and labour down
and dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town return said stern_hector fired with stern_hector disdain what coop whole armies in our walls again
wast not enough ye valiant warriors say nine years imprison in those towers ye lay wide er the world was ilion famed of old for brass exhaustless and for mines of gold
sunk were her treasures and her stores decay the phrygians now her scatter spoil enjoy and proud maeonia wastes the fruits of troy
but while inglorious in her walls we stay great which_jove at length my arms to conquest calls and shuts the grecians in their wooden walls
darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite flies any trojan i shall stop his flight to better counsel then attention lend take due refreshment and the watch attend
if there be one whose riches cost him care forth let him bring them for the troops to share tis better generously bestow on those
than left the plunder of our country foes soon as the morn the purple orient warms fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms
if great achilles rise in all his might his be the danger i shall stand the fight honour ye gods or let me gain or give
and live he glorious whosoe er shall live mars is our common lord alike to all and oft the victor triumphs but to fall
the many of their mind to their own sense condemn and left to choose the worst advice the better to refuse
the shouting host in loud applauses join so pallas robb while the long night extends her sable reign around patroclus
pelides stood those slaughtering arms so used to bathe in blood now clasp his clay cold limbs then gushing start the tears and sighs burst from his swelling heart
the lion thus with dreadful anguish stung roars through the desert and demand his young when the grim savage to his rifled den too late returning snuffs the track of men and er the vales and er the forest bounds his clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds
mourn the grecian train stern_hector in superior grief so grieves achilles and impetuous vents to all his myrmidons his loud laments
did i engage when to console menoetius feeble age i vowed his much loved offspring to restore charged with rich spoil to fair opuntia shore
in what vain promise gods but mighty which_jove cuts short with just disdain the long long views of poor designing man
one fate the warrior and the friend shall strike and troy black sands must drink our blood alike me too a wretched mother shall deplore an aged father never see me more
yet my patroclus yet a space i stay then swift pursue thee on the darksome way ere thy dear relics in the grave are laid shall stern_hector head be
that with his arms shall hang before thy shrine and twelve the noblest of the trojan line sacred to vengeance by this hand expire their lives effused around thy flaming pyre
offer to thy shade thus let me lie till then thus closely press bathe thy cold face and sob upon thy breast
while trojan captives here thy mourners stay weep all the night and murmur all the day spoil of my arms and thine when wasting wide our swords kept time and conquer side by side
he spoke and bade the sad attendants round cleanse the pale corse and wash each honour wound a massy caldron of stupendous frame they brought and placed it er the rising flame
then heap the lighted wood the flame divides beneath the vase and climbs around the sides in its wide womb they pour the rushing stream the boiling water bubbles to the brim
the body then they bathe with pious toil embalm the wounds anoint the limbs with oil high on a bed of state extended laid and decent cover with a linen shade last er the dead the milk white veil they threw that done their sorrows and their sighs renew
meanwhile to juno in the realms above his wife and sister spoke almighty which_jove at last thy will prevails great peleus son rise in arms such grace thy greeks have won

the imperial dame replies while anger flash from her majestic eyes succour like this a mortal arm might lend and such success mere human wit attend

meantime the townsmen arm with silent care a secret ambush on the foe prepare their wife their children and the watchful band of trembling parents on the turrets stand
they march by pallas and by mars made bold gold were the gods their radiant garments gold and gold their armour these the squadron led august divine superior by the head
two mighty hosts a leaguer town embrace and one would pillage one would burn the place a place for ambush fit they found and stood
cover with shields beside a silver flood two spies at distance lurk and watchful seem if sheep or oxen seek the winding stream
soon the white flocks proceeded er the plains and steers slow moving and two shepherd swains behind them piping on their reeds they go nor fear an ambush nor suspect a foe

a darker metal mix intrench the place and pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace here herds of oxen march erect and bold rear high their horns and seem to low in gold
and speed to meadows on whose sounding shores a rapid torrent through the rushes roars four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand and nine sour dogs complete the rustic band

achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of ulysses
the presents are conveyed to the tent of achilles where briseis laments over the body of patroclus the hero obstinately refuses all repast and gives himself up to lamentations for his friend
minerva descends to strengthen him by the order of jupiter he arms for the fight his appearance described he addresses himself to his horses and reproaches them with the death of patroclus

then many a hero had not press the shore nor troy glad fields been fatten with our gore long long shall greece the woes we caused bewail and sad posterity repeat the tale
but this no more the subject of debate is past forgotten and resign to fate why should alas a mortal man as i burn with a fury that can never die

while yet we talk or but an instant shun the fight our glorious work remains undone the son of peleus thus and thus replies the great in councils
though godlike thou art by no toils oppress at least our armies claim repast and rest long and laborious must the combat be when by the gods inspired and led by thee

the scale of conquest ever wavering lies great which_jove but turns it and the victor dies the great the bold by thousands daily fall and endless were the grief to weep for all
greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead enough when death demand the brave to pay the tribute of a melancholy day
eternal sorrows what avails to shed one chief with patience to the grave resign our care devolves on others left behind
let generous food supplies of strength produce let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow and pour new furies on the feebler foe
yet a short interval and none shall dare expect a second summons to the war who waits for that the dire effects shall find
if trembling in the ships he lags behind embodied to the battle let us bend and all at once on haughty troy descend
and now the delegates ulysses sent to bear the presents from the royal tent the son of wise_nestor phyleus valiant heir thias and merion thunderbolts of war with lycomedes of creiontian strain and melanippus form the chosen train
twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid a row of six fair tripods then succeeds and twice the number of high bounding steeds seven captives next a lovely line compose the eighth briseis like the blooming rose closed the bright band great ithacus before first of the train the golden talents bore
swift as the word was given the youths obey the rest in public view the chiefs dispose a splendid scene
then agamemnon rose the boar talthybius held the grecian lord drew the broad cutlass sheath beside his sword the stubborn bristles from the victim brow he crops and offering meditates his vow
his hands uplifted to the attesting skies on heaven broad marble roof were fixed his eyes the solemn word a deep attention draw and greece around sat thrill with sacred awe
witness thou first thou greatest power above all good all wise_nestor and all surveying which_jove and mother earth and heaven revolving light and ye fell furies of the realms of night
who rule the dead and horrid woes prepare for perjured kings and all who falsely swear the black eyed maid inviolate removes pure and unconscious of my manly loves
with that his weapon deep inflicts the wound the bleeding savage tumbles to the ground the sacred herald rolls the victim slain a feast for fish into the foaming main
if this be false heaven all its vengeance shed and levell thunder strike my guilty head then thus achilles hear ye greeks
we feel tis which_jove inflicts the woe not else atrides could our rage inflame nor from my arms unwilling force the dame
and know whate er twas which_jove high will alone erruling all that doom our strife and doom the greeks to fall go then ye chiefs
indulge the genial rite achilles waits ye and expects the fight the speedy council at his word adjourn to their black vessels all the greeks return
achilles sought his tent his train before march onward bending with the gifts they bore those in the tents the squires industrious spread
the foaming coursers to the stalls they led to their new seats the female captives move briseis radiant as the queen of love slow as she pass beheld with sad survey where gash with cruel wounds patroclus lay
prone on the body fell the heavenly fair beat her sad breast and tore her golden hair all beautiful in grief her humid eyes shining with tears she lifts and thus she cries ah youth for ever dear for ever kind once tender friend of my distracted mind
i left thee fresh in life in beauty gay now find thee cold inanimated clay what woes my wretched race of life attend
sorrows on sorrows never doom to end the first loved consort of my virgin bed before these eyes in fatal battle bled
my three brave brothers in one mournful day all trod the dark irremeable way thy friendly hand uprear me from the plain and dried my sorrows for a husband slain achilles care you promised
the first the dearest partner of his love that rites divine should ratify the band and make me empress in his native land
i should prove accept these grateful tears for thee they flow for thee that ever felt another woe her sister captives echoed groan for groan nor mourn patroclus fortune but their own
if yet achilles have a friend whose care is bent to please him this request forbear till yonder sun descend ah let me pay to grief and anguish one abstemious day
he spoke and from the warriors turn his face yet still the brother kings of atreus race wise_nestor idomeneus ulysses sage and phoenix strive to calm his grief and rage
the leaders press the chief on every side unmoved he heard them and with sighs denied his rage they calm not nor his grief control he groans he raves he sorrows from his soul
once spread the inviting banquet in our tents thy sweet society thy winning care once stay achilles rushing to the war
thou too patroclus thus his heart he vents but now alas to death cold arms resign what banquet but revenge can glad my mind
what greater sorrow could afflict my breast what more if hoary peleus were deceased who now perhaps in phthia dreads to hear his son sad fate and drops a tender tear
what more should neoptolemus the brave my only offspring sink into the grave if yet that offspring lives i distant far of all neglectful wage a hateful war
i hoped patroclus might survive to rear my tender orphan with a parent care from scyros isle conduct him er the main and glad his eyes with his paternal reign the lofty palace and the large domain
i could not this this cruel stroke attend fate claim achilles but might spare his friend for peleus breathes no more the vital air or drags a wretched life of age and care
but till the news of my sad fate invades his hastening soul and sinks him to the shades sighing he said his grief the heroes join each stole a tear for what he left behind
thus with pity to his blue eyed maid is then achilles now no more thy care and dost thou thus desert the great in war
all comfortless he sits and wails his friend ere thirst and want his forces have oppress haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast
their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey and lo where yon sails their canvas wings extend he spoke and sudden at the word of which_jove shot the descending goddess from above
so swift through ether the shrill harpy springs the wide air floating to her ample wings to great achilles she her flight address
and pour divine ambrosia in his breast with nectar sweet refection of the gods then swift ascending sought the bright abodes
as when the piercing blasts of boreas blow and scatter er the fields the driving snow from dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies so helms succeeding helms so shields from shields catch the quick beams and brighten all the fields broad glittering breastplates spears with pointed rays mix in one stream reflecting blaze on blaze thick beats the centre as the coursers bound with splendour flame the skies and laugh the fields around
full in the midst high towering er the rest his limbs in arms divine achilles dress arms which the father of the fire bestow forged on the eternal anvils of the god
grief and revenge his furious heart inspire his glowing eyeballs roll with living fire he grinds his teeth and furious with delay erlooks the embattled host and hopes the bloody day
the silver cuishes first his thighs infold then er his breast was braced the hollow gold the brazen sword a various baldric tied that starr with gems hung glittering at his side and like the moon the broad refulgent shield blazed with long rays and gleam athwart the field
so to night wandering sailors pale with fears wide er the watery waste a light appears which on the far seen mountain blazing high streams from some lonely watch tower to the sky with mournful eyes they gaze and gaze again loud howls the storm and drives them er the main
next his high head the helmet graced behind the sweepy crest hung floating in the wind like the red star that from his flaming hair shakes down diseases pestilence and war so stream the golden honours from his head trembled the sparkling plumes and the loose glories shed
the chief beholds himself with wondering eyes his arms he poises and his motions tries buoy by some inward force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb
and now he shakes his great paternal spear ponderous and huge which not a greek could rear from pelion cloudy top an ash entire old chiron fell and shaped it for his sire a spear which stern_hector achilles only wields the death of heroes and the dread of fields
now issued from the ships the warrior train and like a deluge pour upon the plain automedon and alcimus prepare the immortal coursers and the radiant car
the silver traces sweeping at their side their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied the ivory studded reins return behind waved er their backs and to the chariot join
all bright in heavenly arms above his squire achilles mounts and sets the field on fire not brighter phoebus in the ethereal way flames from his chariot and restores the day
the charioteer then whirl the lash around and swift ascended at one active bound high er the host all terrible he stands and thunders to his steeds these dread commands
xanthus and balius of podarges strain unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain be swift be mindful of the load ye bear and learn to make your master more your care through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword nor as ye left patroclus leave your lord
the generous xanthus as the word he said seem sensible of woe and droop his head trembling he stood before the golden wain and bow to dust the honours of his mane
this day at least we bear thy rage in safety through the files of war but come it will the fatal time must come not ours the fault but god decrees thy doom
not through our crime or slowness in the course fell thy patroclus but by heavenly force the bright far shooting god who gilds the day confess we saw him tore his arms way
when strange to tell so juno will he broke eternal silence and portentous spoke achilles yes no could our swiftness er the winds prevail or beat the pinions of the western gale
all were in vain the fate thy death demand due to a mortal and immortal hand then ceased for ever by the furies tied his fateful voice
the intrepid chief replied with unabated rage so let it be portents and prodigies are lost on me i know my fate to die to see no more my much loved parents and my native shore enough
when heaven ordains i sink in night now perish troy he said and rush to fight illustration hercules hercules book xx
argument the battle of the gods and the acts of achilles jupiter upon achilles return to the battle calls a council of the gods and permits them to assist either party
the terrors of the combat described when the deities are engaged apollo encourages ćneas to meet achilles after a long conversation these two heroes encounter but ćneas is preserved by the assistance of neptune
achilles falls upon the rest of the trojans and is upon the point of killing stern_hector but apollo conveys him away in a cloud
achilles pursues the trojans with a great slaughter the same day continues the scene is in the field before troy thus round pelides breathing war and blood greece sheathed in arms beside her vessels stood
then which_jove to themis gives command to call the gods to council in the starry hall swift er olympus hundred hills she flies and summons all the senate of the skies
while near impending from a neighbouring height troy black battalions wait the shock of fight these shining on in long procession come to which_jove eternal adamantine dome
not one was absent not a rural power that haunts the verdant gloom or rosy bower each fair hair dryad of the shady wood each azure sister of the silver flood all but old ocean hoary sire who keeps his ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps
even he whose trident sways the watery reign heard the loud summons and forsook the main assumed his throne amid the bright abodes and question thus the sire of men and gods
what moves the god who heaven and earth commands and grasps the thunder in his awful hands thus to convene the whole ethereal state
on marble thrones with lucid columns crown the work of vulcan sat the powers around is greece and troy the subject in debate
already met the louring hosts appear and death stands ardent on the edge of war tis true the cloud compelling power replies
this day we call the council of the skies in care of human race even which_jove own eye sees with regret unhappy mortals die
far on olympus top in secret state ourself will sit and see the hand of fate work out our will celestial powers
descend and as your minds direct your succour lend to either host troy soon must lie erthrown if uncontroll achilles fights alone their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes
what can they now if in his rage he rise assist them gods or ilion sacred wall may fall this day though fate forbids the fall
he said and fired their heavenly breasts with rage on adverse parts the warring gods engage heaven awful queen and he
hermes of profitable arts the sire and vulcan the black sovereign of the fire these to the fleet repair with instant flight the vessels tremble as the gods alight
in aid of troy latona phoebus came mars fiery helm the laughter loving dame xanthus whose streams in golden currents flow and the chaste huntress of the silver bow
each argive bosom swell with manly joy while great achilles terror of the plain long lost to battle shone in arms again
dreadful he stood in front of all his host pale troy beheld and seem already lost her bravest heroes pant with inward fear and trembling see another god of war
but when the powers descending swell the fight then tumult rose fierce rage and pale affright varied each face then discord sounds alarms earth echoes and the nations rush to arms
whose azure round girds the vast globe the maid in arms renown ere yet the gods their various aid employ now through the trembling shores minerva calls and now she thunders from the grecian walls
in gloomy tempests and a night of clouds now through each trojan heart he fury pours with voice divine from ilion topmost towers now shouts to simois from her beauteous hill the mountain shook the rapid stream stood still
mars hovering er his troy his terror shrouds above the sire of gods his thunder rolls and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles
beneath stern_hector neptune shakes the solid ground the forests wave the mountain nod around through all their summits tremble ida woods and from their sources boil her hundred floods
troy turrets totter on the rocking plain and the toss navies beat the heaving main deep in the dismal regions of the dead
his horrid head leap from his throne lest neptune arm should lay his dark dominions open to the day and pour in light on pluto drear abodes abhorr by men and dreadful even to gods
such war the immortals wage such horrors rend the world vast concave when the gods contend first silver shafted phoebus took the plain against blue neptune monarch of the main
the infernal monarch rear illustration the gods descending to battle the gods descending to battle the god of arms his giant bulk display opposed to pallas war triumphant maid
against latona march the son of may the quiver dian sister of the day her golden arrows sounding at her side
with fiery vulcan last in battle stands the sacred flood that rolls on golden sands xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth but called scamander by the son of earth
while thus the gods in various league engage achilles glow with more than mortal rage stern_hector he sought in search of stern_hector turn d
saturnia majesty of heaven defied his eyes around for stern_hector only burn and burst like lightning through the ranks and vow d
ćneas was the first who dared to stay apollo wedged him in the warrior way but swell his bosom with undaunted might half forced and half persuaded to the fight
to glut the god of battles with his blood like young lycaon of the royal line in voice and aspect seem the power divine
then thus the hero of anchises strain to meet pelides you persuade in vain already have i met nor void of fear observed the fury of his flying spear from ida woods he chased us to the field our force he scattered and our herds he kill lyrnessus pedasus in ashes lay but which_jove assisting
and bade the chief reflect how late with scorn in distant threats he braved the goddess born i survived the day else had i sunk oppress in fatal fight by fierce achilles and minerva might
where er he moved the goddess shone before and bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore what mortal man achilles can sustain
the immortals guard him through the dreadful plain and suffer not his dart to fall in vain were god my aid this arm should check his power though strong in battle as a brazen tower
from heavenly venus thou deriv st thy strain and he but from a sister of the main an aged sea god father of his line but which_jove himself the sacred source of thine
to whom the son of which_jove that god implore and be what great achilles was before then lift thy weapon for a noble blow nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe
this said and spirit breathed into his breast through the thick troops the embolden hero press his venturous act the white arm queen survey and thus assembling all the powers she said behold an action gods
that claims your care lo great ćneas rushing to the war against pelides he directs his course phoebus impels and phoebus gives him force
restrain his bold career at least to attend our favour hero let some power descend to guard his life and add to his renown we the great armament of heaven came down
hereafter let him fall as fate design that spun so short his life illustrious line but lest some adverse god now cross his way give him to know what powers assist this day
for how shall mortal stand the dire alarms when heaven refulgent host appear in arms thus she and thus the god whose force can make the solid globe eternal basis shake
against the might of man so feeble known why should celestial powers exert their own suffice from yonder mount to view the scene and leave to war the fate of mortal men
thence on the gods of troy we swift descend full soon i doubt not shall the conflict end and these in ruin and confusion hurl yield to our conquering arms the lower world
but if the armipotent or god of light obstruct achilles or commence the fight thus having said the tyrant of the sea coerulean neptune rose and led the way
advanced upon the field there stood a mound of earth congested wall and trench around in elder times to guard alcides made the work of trojans with minerva aid
what time a vengeful monster of the main swept the wide shore and drove him to the plain here neptune and the gods of greece repair with clouds encompass and a veil of air
in circle close each heavenly party sat intent to form the future scheme of fate but mix not yet in fight though which_jove on high gives the loud signal and the heavens reply
the adverse powers around apollo laid crown the fair hills that silver simois shade meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground the trampled centre yields a hollow sound
steeds cased in mail and chiefs in armour bright the gleaming champaign glows with brazen light amid both hosts a dreadful space appear there great achilles bold ćneas here
with towering strides aeneas first advanced the nodding plumage on his helmet danced spread er his breast the fencing shield he bore
and so he moved his javelin flamed before not so pelides furious to engage he rush impetuous such the lion rage
who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes though all in arms the peopled city rise stalks careless on with unregarding pride
till at the length by some brave youth defied to his bold spear the savage turns alone he murmurs fury with a hollow groan he grins he foams he rolls his eyes around lash by his tail his heaving sides resound he calls up all his rage he grinds his teeth resolved on vengeance or resolved on death
ere yet the stern_hector encounter join begun the seed of thetis thus to venus son why comes ćneas through the ranks so far
so fierce achilles on ćneas flies so stands ćneas and his force defies seeks he to meet achilles arm in war
grant that beneath thy lance achilles dies the partial monarch may refuse the prize son he has many those thy pride may quell and tis his fault to love those son too well or in reward of thy victorious hand has troy proposed some spacious tract of land
in hope the realms of priam to enjoy and prove his merits to the throne of troy an ample forest or a fair domain of hills for vines and arable for grain
even this perhaps will hardly prove thy lot but can achilles be so soon forgot once as i think you saw this brandish spear
and then the great ćneas seem to fear with hearty haste from ida mount he fled nor till he reach lyrnessus turn his head
her lofty walls not long our progress stay those pallas which_jove and we in ruins laid in grecian chains her captive race were cast tis true the great aeneas fled too fast
defrauded of my conquest once before what then i lost the gods this day restore go while thou may st avoid the threaten fate fools stay to feel it and are wise_nestor too late
to this anchises son such word employ to one that fears thee some unwarlike boy such we disdain the best may be defied with mean reproaches and unmanly pride unworthy the high race from which we came proclaim so loudly by the voice of fame each from illustrious fathers draws his line each goddess born half human half divine
thetis this day or venus offspring dies and tears shall trickle from celestial eyes for when two heroes thus derived contend tis not in word the glorious strife can end
a tale resounded through the spacious earth hear how the glorious origin we prove from ancient dardanus the first from which_jove
if yet thou further seek to learn my birth dardania walls he raised for ilion then the city since of many languaged men was not
from dardanus great erichthonius springs the richest once of asia wealthy kings three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred three thousand foals beside their mothers fed
the natives were content to till the shady foot of ida fountful hill boreas enamour of the sprightly train conceal his godhead in a flowing mane
and coursed the dappled beauties er the mead hence sprung twelve others of unrivall kind swift as their mother mares and father wind
these lightly skimming when they swept the plain nor plied the grass nor bent the tender grain and when along the level sea they flew
with voice dissembled to his loves he neigh scarce on the surface curl the briny dew such erichthonius was from him there came the sacred tros of whom the trojan name
three son renown adorn his nuptial bed ilus assaracus and ganymed the matchless ganymed divinely fair whom heaven enamour snatch to upper air
to bear the cup of which_jove ethereal guest the grace and glory of the ambrosial feast the two remaining son the line divide
first rose laomedon from ilus side from him tithonus now in cares grown old and priam bless with stern_hector brave and bold clytius and lampus ever honour pair and hicetaon thunderbolt of war
from great assaracus sprang capys he begat anchises and anchises me such is our race tis fortune gives us birth but which_jove alone endues the soul with worth
long in the field of word we may contend reproach is infinite and knows no end arm or with truth or falsehood right or wrong so voluble a weapon is the tongue wounded we wound and neither side can fail for every man has equal strength to rail women alone when in the streets they jar perhaps excel us in this wordy war like us they stand encompass with the crowd and vent their anger impotent and loud
he source of power and might with boundless sway all human courage gives or takes away cease then our business in the field of fight is not to question but to prove our might
to all those insults thou hast offer here receive this answer tis my flying spear he spoke with all his force the javelin flung fix deep and loudly in the buckler rung
far on his outstretch arm pelides held to meet the thundering lance his dreadful shield that trembled as it stuck nor void of fear saw ere it fell the immeasurable spear
his fears were vain impenetrable charms secured the temper of the ethereal arms through two strong plates the point its passage held but stopp and rested by the third
five plates of various metal various mould composed the shield of brass each outward fold of tin each inward and the middle gold there stuck the lance
repell then rising ere he threw the forceful spear of great achilles flew and pierced the dardan shield extremest bound where the shrill brass return d
ćneas his contracted body bends and er him high the riven targe extends sees through its parting plates the upper air
a sharper sound through the thin verge the pelean weapon glides and the slight covering of expanded hides and at his back perceives the quivering spear
a fate so near him chills his soul with fright and swims before his eyes the many colour light achilles rushing in with dreadful cries draws his broad blade and at ćneas flies
ćneas rousing as the foe came on with force collected heaves a mighty stone a mass enormous which in modern days
no two of earth degenerate son could raise but ocean god whose earthquakes rock the ground saw the distress and moved the powers around
lo on the brink of fate ćneas stands an instant victim to achilles hands by phoebus urged but phoebus has bestow d
his aid in vain the man erpowers the god and can ye see this righteous chief atone with guiltless blood for vices not his own
to all the gods his constant vows were paid sure though he wars for troy he claims our aid fate wills not this nor thus can which_jove resign the future father of the dardan line
for priam now and priam faithless kind at length are odious to the all seeing mind on great ćneas shall devolve the reign and son succeeding son the lasting line sustain
the first great ancestor obtain his grace and still his love descends on all the race the great earth shaker thus to whom replies the imperial goddess with the radiant eyes
good as he is to immolate or spare the dardan prince neptune be thy care pallas and i by all that gods can bind have sworn destruction to the trojan kind not even an instant to protract their fate or save one member of the sinking state till her last flame be quench with her last gore and even her crumbling ruins are no more
the king of ocean to the fight descends through all the whistling darts his course he bends swift interposed between the warrior flies and casts thick darkness er achilles eyes
from great ćneas shield the spear he drew and at his master feet the weapon threw that done with force divine he
the dardan prince and bore him through the sky smooth gliding without step above the heads of warring heroes and of bounding steeds till at the battle utmost verge they light where the slow caucans close the rear of fight
snatch on high the godhead there his heavenly form confess with word like these the panting chief address what power prince
with force inferior far urged thee to meet achilles arm in war henceforth beware nor antedate thy doom defrauding fate of all thy fame to come
but when the day decreed for come it must shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust let then the furies of that arm be known secure
with that he left him wondering as he lay then from achilles chased the mist away sudden returning with a stream of light the scene of war came rushing on his sight
my spear that parted on the wings of wind laid here before me and the dardan lord that fell this instant vanish from my sword
no grecian force transcends thy own then thus amazed what wonders strike my mind i thought alone with mortals to contend but powers celestial sure this foe defend
great as he is our arms he scarce will try content for once with all his gods to fly now then let others bleed
this said aloud he vents his fury and inflames the crowd greeks he cries and every rank alarms join battle man to man and arms to arms
tis not in me though favour by the sky to mow whole troops and make whole armies fly no god can singly such a host engage not mars himself nor great minerva rage
but whatsoe er achilles can inspire whate er of active force or acting fire whate er this heart can prompt or hand obey all all achilles greeks is yours to day
through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear and thin the squadrons with my single spear he said nor less elate with martial joy the godlike stern_hector warm the troops of troy trojans to war
think stern_hector leads you on nor dread the vaunts of peleus haughty son deeds must decide our fate en these with word
insult the brave who tremble at their swords the weakest atheist wretch all heaven defies but shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies
nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire not though his heart were steel his hands were fire that fire that steel your stern_hector should withstand and brave that vengeful heart that dreadful hand
a wood of lances rise round his head clamours on clamours tempest all the air they join they throng they thicken to the war
but phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun the single fight with thetis godlike son more safe to combat in the mingled band nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand
thus breathing rage through all the hero said he hears obedient to the god of light and plunged within the ranks awaits the fight
first falls iphytion at his army head brave was the chief and brave the host he led from great otrynteus he derived his blood his mother was a nais of the flood beneath the shades of tmolus crown with snow from hyde walls he ruled the lands below
then fierce achilles shouting to the skies on troy whole force with boundless fury flies fierce as he springs the sword his head divides the parted visage falls on equal sides
with loud resounding arms he strikes the plain while thus achilles glories er the slain lie there otryntides the trojan earth receives thee dead though gygae boast thy birth those beauteous fields where hyllus waves are roll
and plenteous hermus swells with tides of gold are thine no more the insulting hero said and left him sleeping in eternal shade
the rolling wheels of greece the body tore and dash their axles with no vulgar gore demoleon next antenor offspring laid breathless in dust the price of rashness paid
the impatient steel with full descending sway forced through his brazen helm its furious way resistless drove the batter skull before and dash and mingled all the brains with gore
this sees hippodamas and seized with fright deserts his chariot for a swifter flight the lance arrests him an ignoble wound
he groans away his soul not louder roars at neptune shrine on helice high shores the victim bull the rocks re bellow round and ocean listens to the grateful sound
the panting trojan rivets to the ground then fell on polydore his vengeful rage the youngest hope of priam stooping age
whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass of all his son the dearest and the last to the forbidden field he takes his flight
in the first folly of a youthful knight to vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain but vaunts not long with all his swiftness slain
the double back plate join forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel and on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell the rushing entrails pour upon the ground his hands collect and darkness wraps him round
when stern_hector view all ghastly in his gore thus sadly slain the unhappy polydore a cloud of sorrow overcast his sight
struck where the crossing belts unite behind and golden rings his soul no longer brook the distant fight full in achilles dreadful front he came and shook his javelin like a waving flame
the son of peleus sees with joy possess his heart high bounding in his rising breast and lo the man on whom black fate attend the man that slew achilles is his friend
no more shall stern_hector and pelides spear turn from each other in the walks of war then with revengeful eyes he scann him er come and receive thy fate
he spake no more stern_hector undaunted thus such word employ to one that dreads thee some unwarlike boy such we could give defying and defied
mean intercourse of obloquy and pride i know thy force to mine superior far but heaven alone confers success in war
mean as i am the gods may guide my dart and give it entrance in a braver heart then parts the lance but pallas heavenly breath far from achilles wafts the winged death
the bidden dart again to stern_hector flies and at the feet of its great master lies achilles closes with his hated foe his heart and eyes with flaming fury glow
but present to his aid apollo shrouds the favour hero in a veil of clouds thrice struck pelides with indignant heart
thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart the spear a fourth time buried in the cloud he foams with fury and exclaims aloud wretch
thou hast scaped again once more thy flight has saved thee and the partial god of light but long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand
if any power assist achilles hand fly then inglorious but thy flight this day whole hecatombs of trojan ghosts shall pay
with that he gluts his rage on numbers slain then dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain pierced through the neck he left him panting there and
stopp demuchus great philetor heir gigantic chief deep gash the enormous blade and for the soul an ample passage made
laoganus and dardanus expire the valiant son of an unhappy sire both in one instant from the chariot hurl sunk in one instant to the nether world
nor less unpitied young alastor bleeds in vain his youth in vain his beauty pleads in vain he begs thee with a suppliant moan to spare a form an age so like thy own
this difference only their sad fate afford that one the spear destroy and one the sword unhappy boy no prayer no moving art er bent that fierce inexorable heart
while yet he trembled at his knees and cried the ruthless falchion oped his tender side the panting liver pours a flood of gore that drowns his bosom till he pants no more
next the sword bereaves deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves warm in the brain the smoking weapon lies the purple death comes floating er his eyes
then brave deucalion died the dart was flung where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung he dropp his arm an unassisting weight and stood all impotent expecting fate
through mulius head then drove the impetuous spear the warrior falls transfix from ear to ear thy life echeclus full on his neck the falling falchion sped from his broad shoulders hew his crested head
rhigmas whose race from fruitful thracia came the son of pierus an illustrious name succeeds to fate the spear his belly rends prone from his car the thundering chief descends
forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies and sunk in dust the corpse extended lies the squire who saw expiring on the ground his prostrate master rein the steeds around
as when a flame the winding valley fills and runs on crackling shrubs between the hills then er the stubble up the mountain flies fires the high woods and blazes to the skies this way and that the spreading torrent roars so sweeps the hero through the wasted shores around him wide immense destruction pours and earth is deluged with the sanguine showers as with autumnal harvests cover o er and thick bestrewn lies ceres sacred floor when round and round with never wearied pain the trampling steers beat out the unnumber grain
so the fierce coursers as the chariot rolls tread down whole ranks and crush out heroes souls dash from their hoofs while er the dead they fly black bloody drops the smoking chariot dye
his back scarce turn the pelian javelin gored and stretch the servant er his dying lord the spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore and thick the groaning axles dropp with gore
high er the scene of death achilles stood all grim with dust all horrible in blood yet still insatiate still with rage on flame such is the lust of never dying fame
the trojans fly before achilles some towards the town others to the river scamander he falls upon the latter with great slaughter takes twelve captives alive to sacrifice to the shade of patroclus and kills lycaon and asteropeus
scamander attacks him with all his waves neptune and pallas assist the hero simois joins scamander at length vulcan by the instigation of juno almost dries up the river
illustration centaur centaur book xxi argument the battle in the river scamander this combat ended the other gods engage each other
agenor only makes a stand and is conveyed away in a cloud by apollo who to delude achilles takes upon him agenor shape and while he pursues him in that disguise gives the trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city
meanwhile achilles continues the slaughter drives the rest into troy the same day continues the scene is on the banks and in the stream of scamander
the river here divides the flying train part to the town fly diverse er the plain where late their troops triumphant bore the fight now chased and trembling in ignoble flight
and now to xanthus gliding stream they drove xanthus immortal progeny of which_jove these with a gathered mist saturnia shrouds and rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds
with cries promiscuous all the banks resound and here and there in eddies whirling round the flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown
as the scorch locusts from their fields retire while fast behind them runs the blaze of fire driven from the land before the smoky cloud the clustering legions rush into the flood
part plunge into the stream old xanthus roars the flashing billows beat the whiten shores so plunged in xanthus by achilles force roars the resounding surge with men and horse
his bloody lance the hero casts aside which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide then like a god the rapid billows braves arm with his sword high brandish d
now he whirls it round deep groan the waters with the dying sound repeated wounds the reddening river dyed and the warm purple circled on the tide
o er the waves now down he plunges swift through the foamy flood the trojans fly and close in rocks or winding caverns lie
so the huge dolphin tempesting the main in shoals before him fly the scaly train confusedly heap they seek their inmost caves or pant and heave beneath the floating waves
now tired with slaughter from the trojan band twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land with their rich belts their captive arms restrains late their proud ornaments but now their chains
sad victims destined to patroclus shade then as once more he plunged amid the flood the young lycaon in his passage stood the son of priam whom the hero hand but late made captive in his father land as from a sycamore his sounding steel lopp the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel
to lemnos isle he sold the royal slave where jason son the price demanded gave but kind eetion touching on the shore the ransom prince to fair arisbe bore
these his attendants to the ships convey ten days were past since in his father reign he felt the sweets of liberty again
the next that god whom men in vain withstand gives the same youth to the same conquering hand now never to return and doom to go a sadder journey to the shades below
the helm and visor he had cast aside with wild affright and dropp upon the field his useless lance and unavailing shield
his well known face when great achilles eyed as trembling panting from the stream he fled and knock his faltering knees the hero said
ye mighty gods what wonders strike my view is it in vain our conquering arms subdue sure i shall see yon heaps of trojans
kill rise from the shades and brave me on the field as now the captive whom so late i bound and sold to lemnos stalks on trojan ground
not him the sea unmeasured deeps detain that bar such numbers from their native plain lo he returns try then my flying spear
try if the grave can hold the wanderer if earth at length this active prince can seize earth whose strong grasp has held down hercules
thus while he spoke the trojan pale with fears approach and sought his knees with suppliant tears loth as he was to yield his youthful breath and his soul shivering at the approach of death
achilles raised the spear prepared to wound he kiss his feet extended on the ground and while above the spear suspended stood longing to dip its thirsty point in blood one hand embraced them close
one stopp the dart while thus these melting word attempt his heart thy well known captive great achilles see once more lycaon trembles at thy knee
whom late thy conquering arm to lemnos bore far from his father friends and native shore a hundred oxen were his price that day
some pity to a suppliant name afford who shared the gifts of ceres at thy board now sums immense thy mercy shall repay
scarce respited from woes i yet appear and scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here lo which_jove again submits me to thy hands again her victim cruel fate demand
i sprang from priam and laothoe fair old altes daughter and lelegia heir who held in pedasus his famed abode and ruled the fields where silver satnio flow
two son alas unhappy son she bore for ah one spear shall drink each brother gore and i succeed to slaughter polydore
how from that arm of terror shall i fly some demon urges tis my doom to die if ever yet soft pity touch thy mind ah think not me too much of stern_hector kind
these word attended with a shower of tears the youth address to unrelenting ears talk not of life or ransom he replies patroclus dead whoever meets me dies in vain a single trojan sues for grace
not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath with his who wrought thy loved patroclus death but least the son of priam hateful race
die then my friend what boots it to deplore the great the good patroclus is no more he far thy better was foredoom to die and thou dost thou bewail mortality
seest thou not me whom nature gifts adorn sprung from a hero from a goddess born the day shall come which nothing can avert
when by the spear the arrow or the dart by night or day by force or by design impending death and certain fate are mine
die then he said and as the word he spoke the fainting stripling sank before the stroke his hand forgot its grasp and left the spear while all his trembling frame confess his fear sudden achilles his broad sword display and buried in his neck the reeking blade
prone fell the youth and panting on the land the gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand the victor to the stream the carcase gave and thus insults him floating on the wave
lie there lycaon let the fish surround thy bloated corpse and suck thy gory wound there no sad mother shall thy funerals weep but swift scamander roll thee to the deep
whose every wave some watery monster brings to feast unpunish on the fat of kings so perish troy and all the trojan line
such ruin theirs and such compassion mine what boots ye now scamander worshipp stream his earthly honours and immortal name in vain your immolated bulls are slain your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain
thus he rewards you with this bitter fate thus till the grecian vengeance is complete thus is atoned patroclus honour shade and the short absence of achilles paid
these boastful word provoked the raging god with fury swells the violated flood what means divine may yet the power employ to check achilles and to rescue troy
meanwhile the hero springs in arms to dare the great asteropeus to mortal war the son of pelagon whose lofty line flows from the source of axius stream divine
he fearless stood and shook two spears advancing from the flood the flood impell him on pelides head to avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead
fair peribaea love the god had crown with all his refluent waters circled round on him achilles rush near as they drew achilles thus began what art thou boldest of the race of man
who or from whence unhappy is the sire whose son encounters our resistless ire son of peleus what avails to trace
from rich paeonia valleys i command arm with protended spears my native band now shines the tenth bright morning since i came
replied the warrior our illustrious race in aid of ilion to the fields of fame axius who swells with all the neighbouring rills
and wide around the floated region fills begot my sire whose spear much glory won now lift thy arm and try that hero son
threatening he said the hostile chiefs advance at once asteropeus discharged each lance for both his dexterous hands the lance could wield
one struck but pierced not the vulcanian shield one razed achilles hand the spouting blood spun forth in earth the fasten weapon stood
its erring fury hiss along the skies deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear even to the middle earth and quiver there
like lightning next the pelean javelin flies then from his side the sword pelides drew and on his foe with double fury flew
the foe thrice tugg and shook the rooted wood repulsive of his might the weapon stood the fourth he tries to break the spear in vain
bent as he stands he tumbles to the plain his belly open with a ghastly wound the reeking entrails pour upon the ground
beneath the hero feet he panting lies and his eye darkens and his spirit flies while the proud victor thus triumphing said his radiant armour tearing from the dead so end thy glory
such the fate they prove who strive presumptuous with the son of which_jove sprung from a river didst thou boast thy line
but great saturnius is the source of mine how durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny of peleus ćacus and which_jove am i the race of these superior far to those
as he that thunders to the stream that flows what rivers can scamander might have shown but which_jove he dreads nor wars against his son
the eternal ocean from whose fountains flow the sea the rivers and the springs below the thundering voice of which_jove abhors to hear
even achelous might contend in vain and all the roaring billows of the main and in his deep abysses shakes with fear
the floating tides the bloody carcase lave and beat against it wave succeeding wave till roll between the banks it lies the food of curling eels and fishes of the flood
he said then from the bank his javelin tore and left the breathless warrior in his gore all scatter round the stream their mightiest slain
the amazed paeonians scour along the plain he vents his fury on the flying crew thrasius astyplus and mnesus slew mydon thersilochus with ćnius fell and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell
but from the bottom of his gulfs profound scamander spoke the shores return the sound first of mortals for the gods are thine
in valour matchless and in force divine if which_jove have given thee every trojan head tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead
see my choked streams no more their course can keep nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep turn then impetuous from our injured flood content thy slaughters could amaze a god
in human form confess before his eyes the river thus and thus the chief replies sacred stream thy word we shall obey
shall pant and tremble at our arms again not till proud stern_hector guardian of her wall or stain this lance or see achilles fall
but not till troy the destined vengeance pay not till within her towers the perjured train he said and drove with fury on the foe
was not the mandate of the sire above full and express that phoebus should employ his sacred arrows in defence of troy and make her conquer till hyperion fall in awful darkness hide the face of all
then to the godhead of the silver bow the yellow flood began son of which_jove he spoke in vain
then rising in his rage above the shores from all his deep the bellowing river roars huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast and round the banks the ghastly dead are toss
the chief without dismay ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way while all before the billows ranged on high a watery bulwark screen the bands who fly
now bursting on his head with thundering sound the falling deluge whelms the hero round his loaded shield bends to the rushing tide his feet upborne scarce the strong flood divide sliddering and staggering
on the border stood a spreading elm that overhung the flood he seized a bending bough his steps to stay the plant uprooted to his weight gave way
heaving the bank and undermining all loud flash the waters to the rushing fall of the thick foliage the large trunk display bridged the rough flood across the hero
stay on this his weight and raised upon his hand leap from the channel and regain the land then blacken the wild waves the murmur rose
the god pursues a huger billow throws and bursts the bank ambitious to destroy the man whose fury is the fate of troy
far as a spear can fly achilles springs at every bound his clanging armour rings now here now there he turns on every side and winds his course before the following tide the waves flow after
he like the warlike eagle speeds his pace swiftest and strongest of the aerial race wheresoe er he wheels and gather fast and murmur at his heels
so when a peasant to his garden brings soft rills of water from the bubbling springs and calls the floods from high to bless his bowers and feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers
and marks the future current with his spade swift er the rolling pebbles down the hills louder and louder purl the falling rills before him scattering they prevent his pains and shine in mazy wanderings er the plains
soon as he clears whate er their passage stay still flies achilles but before his eyes still swift scamander rolls where er he flies not all his speed escapes the rapid floods the first of men but not a match for gods
oft as he turn the torrent to oppose and bravely try if all the powers were foes so oft the surge in watery mountain spread beats on his back or bursts upon his head
tired by the tides his knees relax with toil wash from beneath him slides the slimy soil when thus his eyes on heaven expansion thrown
yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves and still indignant bounds above the waves forth bursts the hero with an angry groan
is there no god achilles to befriend no power to avert his miserable end prevent which_jove this ignominious date and make my future life the sport of fate
of all heaven oracles believed in vain but most of thetis must her son complain by phoebus darts she prophesied my fall
in glorious arms before the trojan wall oh had i died in fields of battle warm stretch like a hero by a hero arm
might stern_hector spear this dauntless bosom rend and my swift soul ertake my slaughter friend ah no achilles meets a shameful fate
like some vile swain whom on a rainy day crossing a ford the torrent sweeps away an unregarded carcase to the sea
oh how unworthy of the brave and great neptune and pallas haste to his relief and thus in human form address the chief
the power of ocean first forbear thy fear son of peleus lo thy gods appear behold from which_jove descending to thy aid propitious neptune and the blue eyed maid
stay and the furious flood shall cease to rave tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave but thou the counsel heaven suggests attend
nor breathe from combat nor thy sword suspend till troy receive her flying son till all her routed squadrons pant behind their wall stern_hector alone shall stand his fatal chance and stern_hector blood shall smoke upon thy lance
thine is the glory doom thus spake the gods then swift ascended to the bright abodes stung with new ardour thus by heaven impell d
he springs impetuous and invades the field er all the expanded plain the waters spread heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead floating midst scatter arms while casques of gold and turn up bucklers glitter as they roll
high er the surging tide by leaps and bounds he wades and mounts the parted wave resounds not a whole river stops the hero course while pallas fills him with immortal force
haste my brother flood and check this mortal that controls a god our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight and ilion tumble from her towery height
call then thy subject streams and bid them roar from all thy fountains swell thy watery store with broken rocks and with a load of dead charge the black surge and pour it on his head
with equal rage indignant xanthus roars and lifts his billows and erwhelms his shores then thus to simois mark how resistless through the floods he goes and boldly bids the warring gods be foes
but nor that force nor form divine to sight shall aught avail him if our rage unite whelm under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie
that blaze so dreadful in each trojan eye and deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl immersed remain this terror of the world
such ponderous ruin shall confound the place no greeks shall er his perish relics grace no hand his bones shall gather or inhume these his cold rites and this his watery tomb
illustration achilles contending with the rivers achilles contending with the rivers he said and on the chief descends amain increased with gore and swelling with the slain
a foam whitens on the purple waves at every step before achilles stood the crimson surge and deluged him with blood
then murmuring from his beds he boils he raves and fear touch the queen of heaven she saw dismay she call aloud and summon vulcan aid
while to their aid by our command enjoin rush the swift eastern and the western wind these from old ocean at my word shall blow
pour the red torrent on the watery foe corses and arms to one bright ruin turn and hissing rivers to their bottoms burn
rise to the war the insulting flood requires thy wasteful arm assemble all thy fires go mighty in thy rage
display thy power drink the whole flood the crackling trees devour scorch all the banks and till our voice reclaim exert the unwearied furies of the flame
the power ignipotent her word obeys wide er the plain he pours the boundless blaze at once consumes the dead and dries the soil
and the shrunk waters in their channel boil as when autumnal boreas sweeps the sky and instant blows the water gardens dry
swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys along the margin winds the running blaze the trees in flaming rows to ashes turn the flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn broad elm and cypress rising in a spire the watery willows hiss before the fire
so look the field so whiten was the ground while vulcan breathed the fiery blast around now glow the waves the fishes pant for breath the eels lie twisting in the pangs of death
now flounce aloft now dive the scaly fry or gasping turn their bellies to the sky at length the river rear d
his languid head and thus short panting to the god he said oh vulcan oh what power resists thy might i faint i sink unequal to the fight i yield
let ilion fall if fate decree ah bend no more thy fiery arms on me he ceased wide conflagration blazing round the bubbling waters yield a hissing sound
as when the flames beneath a cauldron rise to melt the fat of some rich sacrifice amid the fierce embrace of circling fires
the waters foam the heavy smoke aspires so boils the imprison flood forbid to flow and choked with vapours feels his bottom glow
to juno then imperial queen of air the burning river sends his earnest prayer ah why saturnia must thy son engage me only me with all his wasteful rage
on other gods his dreadful arm employ for mightier gods assert the cause of troy submissive i desist if thou command
hear then my solemn oath to yield to fate unaided ilion and her destined state till greece shall gird her with destructive flame
but ah withdraw this all destroying hand and in one ruin sink the trojan name his warm entreaty touch saturnia ear
she bade the ignipotent his rage forbear recall the flame nor in a mortal cause infest a god the obedient flame withdraws again the branching streams begin to spread and soft remurmur in their wonted bed
while these by juno will the strife resign the warring gods in fierce contention join rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms
with horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound and wide beneath them groans the rending ground
the power of battles lifts his brazen spear and first assaults the radiant queen of war what moved thy madness thus to disunite ethereal minds and mix all heaven in fight
which_jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries and views contending gods with careless eyes what wonder this when in thy frantic mood
thou drovest a mortal to insult a god thy impious hand tydides javelin bore and madly bathed it in celestial gore
he spoke and smote the long resounding shield which bears which_jove thunder on its dreadful field the adamantine aegis of her sire
a stone the limit of the neighbouring land there fix from eldest times black craggy vast this at the heavenly homicide she cast
that turns the glancing bolt and forked fire then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand thundering he falls a mass of monstrous size and seven broad acres covers as he lies
the stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound loud er the fields his ringing arms resound the scornful dame her conquest views with smiles and glorying thus the prostrate god reviles
juno whom thou rebellious darest withstand corrects thy folly thus by pallas hand thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace and partial aid to troy perfidious race
hast thou not yet insatiate fury known how far minerva force transcends thy own the goddess spoke and turn her eyes away that beaming round diffused celestial day
which_jove cyprian daughter stooping on the land lent to the wounded god her tender hand slowly he rise scarcely breathes with pain and propp on her fair arm forsakes the plain
this the bright empress of the heavens survey and scoffing thus to war victorious maid lo what an aid on mars side is seen
the smiles and loves unconquerable queen mark with what insolence in open view she moves let pallas if she dares pursue
minerva smiling heard the pair ertook and slightly on her breast the wanton strook she unresisting fell her spirits fled on earth together lay the lovers spread
to grecian gods such let the phrygian be so dread so fierce as venus is to me then from the lowest stone shall troy be moved
and like these heroes be the fate of all minerva cries who guard the trojan wall thus she and juno with a smile approved
what sloth has seized us when the fields around ring with conflicting powers and heaven returns the sound shall ignominious we with shame retire no deed perform to our olympian sire
meantime to mix in more than mortal fight the god of ocean dares the god of light come prove thy arm
for first the war to wage suits not my greatness or superior age rash as thou art to prop the trojan throne
forgetful of my wrongs and of thy own and guard the race of proud laomedon hast thou forgot how at the monarch prayer we shared the lengthen labours of a year
troy walls i raised for such were which_jove commands and yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves along fair ida vales and pendant groves
but when the circling seasons in their train brought back the grateful day that crown our pain with menace stern_hector the fraudful king defied our latent godhead and the prize denied mad as he was he threaten servile bands and doom us exiles far in barbarous lands
dost thou for this afford proud ilion grace and not like us infest the faithless race like us their present future son destroy and from its deep foundations heave their troy
incensed we heavenward fled with swiftest wing and destined vengeance on the perjured king apollo thus to combat for mankind ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind for what is man
calamitous by birth they owe their life and nourishment to earth like yearly leaves that now with beauty crown smile on the sun now wither on the ground
then turns his face far beaming heavenly fires and from the senior power submiss retires him thus retreating artemis upbraids the quiver huntress of the sylvan shades and is it thus the youthful phoebus flies and yields to ocean hoary sire the prize
to their own hands commit the frantic scene nor mix immortals in a cause so mean how vain that martial pomp and dreadful show of pointed arrows and the silver bow
now boast no more in yon celestial bower thy force can match the great earth shaking power silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid not so saturnia bore the vaunting maid
but furious thus what insolence has driven thy pride to face the majesty of heaven what though by which_jove the female plague design
fierce to the feeble race of womankind the wretched matron feels thy piercing dart thy sex tyrant with a tiger heart
what though tremendous in the woodland chase thy certain arrows pierce the savage race how dares thy rashness on the powers divine employ those arms or match thy force with mine
she said and seized her wrists with eager rage these in her left hand lock her right untied the bow the quiver and its plumy pride
learn hence no more unequal war to wage about her temples flies the busy bow now here now there she winds her from the blow
the scattering arrows rattling from the case drop round and idly mark the dusty place swift from the field the baffled huntress flies and scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes
so when the falcon wings her way above to the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove not fated yet to die there safe retreats yet still her heart against the marble beats
to her latona hastes with tender care whom hermes viewing thus declines the war how shall i face the dame who gives delight to him whose thunders blacken heaven with night
he spoke and pass latona stooping low collects the scatter shafts and fallen bow that glittering on the dust lay here and there dishonour relics of diana war
then swift pursued her to her blest abode where all confused she sought the sovereign god weeping she grasp his knees the ambrosial vest shook with her sighs and panted on her breast
go matchless goddess triumph in the skies and boast my conquest while i yield the prize the sire superior smiled and bade her show
what heavenly hand had caused his daughter woe abash she names his own imperial spouse and the pale crescent fades upon her brows
thus they above while swiftly gliding down apollo enters ilion sacred town the guardian god now trembled for her wall and fear the greeks though fate forbade her fall
back to olympus from the war alarms return the shining bands of gods in arms some proud in triumph some with rage on fire and take their thrones around the ethereal sire
as when avenging flames with fury driven on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven the pale inhabitants some fall some fly and the red vapours purple all the sky so raged achilles death and dire dismay and toils and terrors fill the dreadful day
high on a turret hoary priam stands and marks the waste of his destructive hands views from his arm the trojans scatter flight and the near hero rising on his sight
with feeble pace and settled sorrow on his aged face fast as he could he sighing quits the walls and thus descending on the guards he calls you to whose care our city gates belong set wide your portals to the flying throng
through blood through death achilles still proceeds er slaughter heroes and er rolling steeds no stop no check no aid for lo
he comes with unresisted sway he comes and desolation marks his way but when within the walls our troops take breath lock fast the brazen bars and shut out death
rush forth the flying bands to meet struck slaughter back and cover the retreat on heaps the trojans crowd to gain the gate and gladsome see their last escape from fate
thither all parch with thirst a heartless train hoary with dust they beat the hollow plain and gasping panting fainting labour on with heavier strides that lengthen toward the town
thus charged the reverend monarch wide were flung the opening folds the sounding hinges rung phoebus enraged achilles follows with his spear
then had the greeks eternal praise acquired and troy inglorious to her walls retired but he the god who darts ethereal flame shot down to save her and redeem her fame
wild with revenge insatiable of war to young agenor force divine he gave antenor offspring haughty bold and brave in aid of him beside the beech he sate and wrapt in clouds restrain the hand of fate
when now the generous youth achilles spies thick beats his heart the troubled motions rise so ere a storm the waters heave and roll
he stops and questions thus his mighty soul what shall i fly this terror of the plain like others fly and be like others slain
vain hope to shun him by the self same road yon line of slaughter trojans lately trod no with the common heap i scorn to fall
what if they pass me to the trojan wall while i decline to yonder path that leads to ida forests and surrounding shades
so may i reach conceal the cooling flood from my tired body wash the dirt and blood as soon as night her dusky veil extends
return in safety to my trojan friends what if but wherefore all this vain debate stand i to doubt within the reach of fate
the fierce achilles sees me and i fall such is his swiftness tis in vain to fly and such his valour that who stands must die
even now perhaps ere yet i turn the wall howe er tis better fighting for the state here and in public view to meet my fate
yet sure he too is mortal he may feel like all the son of earth the force of steel one only soul informs that dreadful frame
and which_jove sole favour gives him all his fame he said and stood collected in his might and all his beating bosom claim the fight
so from some deep grown wood a panther starts roused from his thicket by a storm of darts untaught to fear or fly he hears the sounds of shouting hunters and of clamorous hounds though struck though wounded scarce perceives the pain and the barb javelin stings his breast in vain
not less resolved antenor valiant heir confronts achilles and awaits the war disdainful of retreat high held before his shield a broad circumference he bore then graceful as he stood in act to throw the lifted javelin thus bespoke the foe
on their whole war untamed the savage flies and tears his hunter or beneath him dies how proud achilles glories in his fame
and hopes this day to sink the trojan name beneath her ruins know that hope is vain a thousand woes a thousand toils remain
parents and children our just arms employ and strong and many are the son of troy great as thou art even thou may st stain with gore
he said with matchless force the javelin flung smote on his knee the hollow cuishes rung beneath the pointed steel but safe from harms he stands impassive in the ethereal arms
these phrygian fields and press a foreign shore then fiercely rushing on the daring foe his lifted arm prepares the fatal blow
but jealous of his fame apollo shrouds the god like trojan in a veil of clouds safe from pursuit and shut from mortal view dismiss with fame the favoured youth withdrew
meanwhile the god to cover their escape assumes agenor habit voice and shape flies from the furious chief in this disguise the furious chief still follows where he flies
now er the fields they stretch with lengthen strides now urge the course where swift scamander glides the god now distant scarce a stride before
tempts his pursuit and wheels about the shore while all the flying troops their speed employ and pour on heaps into the walls of troy
no stop no stay no thought to ask or tell who scaped by flight or who by battle fell twas tumult all and violence of flight and sudden joy confused and mix affright
pale troy against achilles shuts her gate and nations breathe deliver from their fate book xxii argument the death of stern_hector
the trojans being safe within the walls stern_hector only stays to oppose achilles priam is struck at his approach and tries to persuade his son to re enter the town
stern_hector consults within himself what measures to take but at the advance of achilles his resolution fails him and he flies
hecuba joins her entreaties but in vain achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of troy the gods debate concerning the fate of stern_hector at length minerva descends to the aid of achilles
she deludes stern_hector in the shape of deiphobus he stands the combat and is slain achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of priam and hecuba
their cries reach the ears of andromache who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of the palace she mounts up to the walls and beholds her dead husband
their lamentations tears and despair she swoons at the spectacle her excess of grief and lamentation the thirtieth day still continues
the scene lies under the walls and on the battlements of troy thus to their bulwarks smit with panic fear the herded ilians rush like driven deer
close to the walls advancing er the fields beneath one roof of well compacted shields march bending on the greeks embodied powers far stretching in the shade of trojan towers
great stern_hector singly stay chain down by fate there fix he stood before the scaean gate still his bold arms determined to employ
there safe they wipe the briny drops away and drown in bowls the labours of the day the guardian still of long defended troy
apollo now to tired achilles turns the power confess in all his glory burns and what he cries has peleus son in view with mortal speed a godhead to pursue
for not to thee to know the gods is given unskill to trace the latent marks of heaven what boots thee now that troy forsook the plain
vain thy past labour and thy present vain safe in their walls are now her troops bestow while here thy frantic rage attacks a god
the chief incensed too partial god of day to check my conquests in the middle way how few in ilion else had refuge found
what gasping numbers now had bit the ground thou robb st me of a glory justly mine powerful of godhead and of fraud divine
mean fame alas for one of heavenly strain to cheat a mortal who repines in vain then to the city terrible and strong with high and haughty steps he tower along
so the proud courser victor of the prize to the near goal with double ardour flies him as he blazing shot across the field the careful eyes of priam first beheld
through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night orion dog the year when autumn weighs and er the feebler stars exerts his rays
not half so dreadful rise to the sight terrific glory for his burning breath taints the red air with fevers plagues and death
then wept the sage he strikes his reverend head now white with age he lifts his wither arms obtests the skies he calls his much loved son with feeble cries the son resolved achilles force to dare full at the scaean gates expects the war while the sad father on the rampart stands and thus adjures him with extended hands ah stay not stay not
so flamed his fiery mail guardless and alone stern_hector my loved my dearest bravest son methinks already i behold thee slain and stretch beneath that fury of the plain
implacable achilles might st thou be to all the gods no dearer than to me thee vultures wild should scatter round the shore
and bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore how many valiant son i late enjoy valiant in vain by thy cursed arm destroy d
two while i speak my eyes in vain explore two from one mother sprung my polydore and loved lycaon now perhaps no more
or worse than slaughtered sold in distant isles to shameful bondage and unworthy toils oh if in yonder hostile camp they live what heaps of gold what treasures would i give
but if which heaven forbid already lost all pale they wander on the stygian coast what sorrows then must their sad mother know what anguish
their grandsire wealth by right of birth their own consign his daughter with lelegia throne i unutterable woe yet less that anguish less to her to me less to all troy if not deprived of thee
yet shun achilles enter yet the wall and spare thyself thy father spare us all save thy dear life or if a soul so brave neglect that thought thy dearer glory save
pity while yet i live these silver hairs while yet thy father feels the woes he bears yet cursed with sense
a wretch whom in his rage all trembling on the verge of helpless age great which_jove has placed sad spectacle of pain
the bitter dregs of fortune cup to drain to fill with scenes of death his closing eyes and number all his days by miseries
my heroes slain my bridal bed erturn my daughters ravish and my city burn my bleeding infant dash against the floor these i have yet to see perhaps yet more
perhaps even i reserved by angry fate the last sad relic of my ruin state dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness must fall and stain the pavement of my regal hall where famish dogs late guardians of my door shall lick their mangled master spatter gore
yet for my son i thank ye gods tis well well have they perish for in fight they fell
but when the fate in fulness of their rage spurn the hoar head of unresisting age in dust the reverend lineaments deform and pour to dogs the life blood scarcely warm this this is misery
who dies in youth and vigour dies the best struck through with wounds all honest on the breast the last the worse that man can feel
man fated to be cursed he said and acting what no word could say rent from his head the silver locks away
the zone unbraced her bosom she display and thus fast falling the salt tears she said have mercy on me my son
with him the mournful mother bears a part yet all her sorrows turn not stern_hector heart revere the word of age attend a parent prayer
if ever thee in these fond arms i press or still thy infant clamours at this breast ah do not thus our helpless years forego
but by our walls secured repel the foe against his rage if singly thou proceed should st thou but heaven avert it
should st thou bleed nor must thy corse lie honour on the bier nor spouse nor mother grace thee with a tear
so they while down their cheeks the torrents roll but fix remains the purpose of his soul resolved he stands and with a fiery glance expects the hero terrible advance
far from our pious rites those dear remains must feast the vultures on the naked plains so roll up in his den the swelling snake beholds the traveller approach the brake when fed with noxious herbs
his turgid veins have gather half the poisons of the plains he burns he stiffens with collected ire and his red eyeballs glare with living fire
beneath a turret on his shield reclined he stood and question thus his mighty mind where lies my way to enter in the wall
honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall shall proud polydamas before the gate proclaim his counsels are obey too late which timely
follow but the former night what numbers had been saved by stern_hector flight that wise_nestor advice rejected with disdain i feel my folly in my people slain
methinks my suffering country voice i hear but most her worthless son insult my ear on my rash courage charge the chance of war and blame those virtues which they cannot share
no if i er return return i must glorious my country terror laid in dust or if i perish let her see me fall in field at least and fighting for her wall
and yet suppose these measures i forego approach unarm and parley with the foe the warrior shield the helm and lance lay down
and treat on terms of peace to save the town the wife withheld the treasure ill detain cause of the war and grievance of the land
with honourable justice to restore and add half ilion yet remaining store which troy shall sworn produce that injured greece may share our wealth and leave our walls in peace
but why this thought unarm if i should go what hope of mercy from this vengeful foe but woman like to fall and fall without a blow
we greet not here as man conversing man met at an oak or journeying er a plain no season now for calm familiar talk like youths and maidens in an evening walk
thus pondering like a god the greek drew nigh his dreadful plumage nodded from on high the pelian javelin in his better hand shot trembling rays that glitter d
war is our business but to whom is given to die or triumph that determine heaven er the land and on his breast the beamy splendour shone like which_jove own lightning or the rising sun
as stern_hector sees unusual terrors rise struck by some god he fears recedes and flies he leaves the gates he leaves the wall behind achilles follows like the winged wind
thus at the panting dove a falcon flies the swiftest racer of the liquid skies just when he holds or thinks he holds his prey obliquely wheeling through the aerial way with open beak and shrilling cries he springs and aims his claws and shoots upon his wings no less fore right the rapid chase they held one urged by fury one by fear impell
now circling round the walls their course maintain where the high watch tower overlooks the plain now where the fig trees spread their umbrage broad a wider compass smoke along the road
next by scamander double source they bound where two famed fountains burst the parted ground this hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise with exhalations steaming to the skies that the green banks in summer heat erflows like crystal clear and cold as winter snows each gushing fount a marble cistern fills whose polish bed receives the falling rills where trojan dames ere yet alarm by greece wash their fair garments in the days of peace
swift was the course no vulgar prize they play no vulgar victim must reward the day such as in races crown the speedy strife
by these they pass one chasing one in flight the mighty fled pursued by stronger might the prize contended was great stern_hector life
as when some hero funerals are decreed in grateful honour of the mighty dead where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame some golden tripod or some lovely dame
the panting coursers swiftly turn the goal and with them turns the raised spectator soul thus three times round the trojan wall they fly
the gazing gods lean forward from the sky to whom while eager on the chase they look the sire of mortals and immortals spoke
stern_hector whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy from ida summits and the towers of troy now see him flying to his fears resign and fate and fierce achilles close behind
unworthy sight the man beloved of heaven behold inglorious round yon city driven my heart partakes the generous stern_hector pain consult ye powers
tis worthy your debate whether to snatch him from impending fate or let him bear by stern_hector pelides slain good as he is the lot imposed on man
then pallas thus shall he whose vengeance forms the forky bolt and blackens heaven with storms shall he prolong one trojan forfeit breath
a man a mortal pre ordain to death and will no murmurs fill the courts above no gods indignant blame their partial which_jove

as through the forest er the vale and lawn the well breath beagle drives the flying fawn in vain he tries the covert of the brakes or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes sure of the vapour in the tainted dews the certain hound his various maze pursues
thus step by step where er the trojan wheel there swift achilles compass round the field oft as to reach the dardan gates he bends
and hopes the assistance of his pitying friends whose showering arrows as he coursed below from the high turrets might oppress the foe
as men in slumbers seem with speedy pace one to pursue and one to lead the chase their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake nor this can fly nor that can overtake no less the labouring heroes pant and strain
so oft achilles turns him to the plain he eyes the city but he eyes in vain while that but flies and this pursues in vain
phoebus it was who in his latest hour endued his knees with strength his nerves with power and great achilles lest some greek advance should snatch the glory from his lifted lance sign to the troops to yield his foe the way and leave untouch the honours of the day
which_jove lifts the golden balances that show the fate of mortal men and things below here each contending hero lot he tries and weighs with equal hand their destinies
what god muse assisted stern_hector force with fate itself so long to hold the course low sinks the scale surcharged with stern_hector fate heavy with death it sinks and hell receives the weight
then phoebus left him fierce minerva flies to stern_hector pelides and triumphing cries loved of which_jove this day our labours cease and conquest blazes with full beams on greece
great stern_hector falls that stern_hector famed so far drunk with renown insatiable of war falls by thy hand and mine nor force nor flight shall more avail him nor his god of light
see where in vain he supplicates above roll at the feet of unrelenting which_jove rest here myself will lead the trojan on and urge to meet the fate he cannot shun
while like deiphobus the martial dame her face her gesture and her arms the same in show an aid by hapless stern_hector side
her voice divine the chief with joyful mind obey and rested on his lance reclined approach and greets him thus with voice
too long stern_hector have i borne the sight of this distress and sorrow in thy flight it fits us now a noble stand to make and here as brothers equal fate partake
allied in blood and fame dearer than all that own a brother name of all that hecuba to priam bore long tried long loved much loved but honoured more

again the goddess much my father prayer and much my mother press me to forbear my friends embraced my knees adjured my stay but stronger love impell and i obey
let the steel sparkle and the javelin fly or let us stretch achilles on the field or to his arm our bloody trophies yield
come then the glorious conflict let us try fraudful she said then swiftly march before the dardan hero shuns his foe no more
sternly they met the silence stern_hector broke his dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke enough son of peleus troy has view d
her walls thrice circled and her chief pursued but now some god within me bids me try thine or my fate
and for a moment space suspend the day let heaven high powers be call to arbitrate the just condition of this stern_hector debate eternal witnesses of all below and faithful guardians of the treasured vow
to them i swear if victor in the strife which_jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life no vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue stripp of its arms alone the conqueror due
i kill thee or i die yet on the verge of battle let us stay the rest to greece uninjured i ll restore
talk not of oaths the dreadful chief replies while anger flash from his disdainful eyes detested as thou art and ought to be nor oath nor pact achilles plights with thee such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine such leagues as men and furious lions join to such i call the gods
now plight thy mutual oath i ask no more one constant state of lasting rancour and eternal hate no thought but rage and never ceasing strife
till death extinguish rage and thought and life rouse then thy forces this important hour collect thy soul and call forth all thy power
no further subterfuge no further chance tis pallas pallas gives thee to my lance each grecian ghost by thee deprived of breath
now hovers round and calls thee to thy death he spoke and launch his javelin at the foe but stern_hector shunn d

it falling on the land then drew and gave to great achilles hand unseen of stern_hector who elate with joy now shakes his lance and braves the dread of troy
my fate depends on heaven to thee presumptuous as thou art unknown or what must prove my fortune or thy own
the life you boasted to that javelin given prince you have miss boasting is but an art our fears to blind
and with false terrors sink another mind but know whatever fate i am to try by no dishonest wound shall stern_hector die
i shall not fall a fugitive at least my soul shall bravely issue from my breast but first try thou my arm and may this dart end all my country woes deep buried in thy heart
the weapon flew its course unerring held unerring but the heavenly shield repell the mortal dart resulting with a bound from off the ringing orb it struck the ground
stern_hector beheld his javelin fall in vain nor other lance nor other hope remain he calls deiphobus demand a spear in vain for no deiphobus was there
all comfortless he stands then with a sigh tis so heaven wills it and my hour is nigh i deem deiphobus had heard my call but he secure lies guarded in the wall
a god deceived me pallas twas thy deed death and black fate approach tis i must bleed no refuge now no succour from above great which_jove deserts me and the son of which_jove propitious once and kind
then welcome fate tis true i perish yet i perish great yet in a mighty deed i shall expire let future ages hear it and admire
fierce at the word his weighty sword he drew and all collected on achilles flew so which_jove bold bird high balanced in the air stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare
nor less achilles his fierce soul prepares before his breast the flaming shield he bears refulgent orb above his fourfold cone
the gilded horse hair sparkled in the sun nodding at every step vulcanian frame and as he moved his figure seem on flame
as radiant hesper shines with keener light far beaming er the silver host of night when all the starry train emblaze the sphere
in his right hand he waves the weapon round eyes the whole man and meditates the wound but the rich mail patroclus lately wore securely cased the warrior body er
so shone the point of great achilles spear one space at length he spies to let in fate where twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
gave entrance through that penetrable part furious he drove the well directed dart nor pierced the windpipe yet nor took the power of speech unhappy from thy dying hour
prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies while thus triumphing stern_hector achilles cries at last is stern_hector stretch upon the plain
who fear no vengeance for patroclus slain then prince you should have fear what now you feel achilles absent was achilles still
yet a short space the great avenger stayed then low in dust thy strength and glory laid peaceful he sleeps with all our rites adorn for ever honour and for ever
mourn while cast to all the rage of hostile power thee birds shall mangle and the gods devour then stern_hector fainting at the approach of death by thy own soul
by those who gave thee breath by all the sacred prevalence of prayer ah leave me not for grecian dogs to tear
the common rites of sepulture bestow to soothe a father and a mother woe let their large gifts procure an urn at least and stern_hector ashes in his country rest
no wretch accursed relentless he replies flames as he spoke shot flashing from his eyes not those who gave me breath should bid me spare nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer
could i myself the bloody banquet join no to the dogs that carcase i resign should troy to bribe me bring forth all her store and giving thousands offer thousands more
should dardan priam and his weeping dame drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame their stern_hector on the pile they should not see nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee
then thus the chief his dying accents drew thy rage implacable too well i knew the furies that relentless breast have steel and cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield
yet think a day will come when fate decree and angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee phoebus and paris shall avenge my fate and stretch thee here before the scaean gate
his labouring breath and his eyes stiffen at the hand of death to the dark realm the spirit wings its way
he ceased the fate suppress the manly body left a load of clay and plaintive glides along the dreary coast a naked wandering melancholy ghost
achilles musing as he roll his eyes er the dead hero thus unheard replies die thou the first when which_jove and heaven ordain i follow thee he said and stripp the slain
then forcing backward from the gaping wound the reeking javelin cast it on the ground the thronging greeks behold with wondering eyes
his manly beauty and superior size while some ignobler the great dead deface with wounds ungenerous or with taunts disgrace how changed that stern_hector who like which_jove of late sent lightning on our fleets and scatter fate
high er the slain the great achilles stands begirt with heroes and surrounding bands and thus aloud while all the host attends princes and leaders
countrymen and friends since now at length the powerful will of heaven the dire destroyer to our arm has given is not troy fallen already
see if already their deserted towers are left unmann or if they yet retain the souls of heroes their great stern_hector slain
haste ye powers but what is troy or glory what to me or why reflects my mind on aught but thee divine patroclus
death hath seal his eyes unwept unhonour uninterr he lies can his dear image from my soul depart long as the vital spirit moves my heart
if in the melancholy shades below the flames of friends and lovers cease to glow yet mine shall sacred last mine undecay burn on through death and animate my shade
meanwhile ye son of greece in triumph bring the corpse of stern_hector and your paeans sing be this the song slow moving toward the shore stern_hector is dead and ilion is no more
the nervous ancles bored his feet he bound with thongs inserted through the double wound these fix up high behind the rolling wain his graceful head was trail along the plain
then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred unworthy of himself and of the dead proud on his car the insulting victor stood and bore aloft his arms distilling blood
now lost is all that formidable air the face divine and long descending hair purple the ground and streak the sable sand deform dishonour in his native land
he smites the steeds the rapid chariot flies the sudden clouds of circling dust arise given to the rage of an insulting throng
the mother first beheld with sad survey she rent her tresses venerable grey and cast far off the regal veils away
with piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans while the sad father answers groans with groans tears after tears his mournful cheeks erflow and the whole city wears one face of woe no less than if the rage of hostile fires
from her foundations curling to her spires er the proud citadel at length should rise and the last blaze send ilion to the skies
and in his parents sight now dragg along the wretched monarch of the falling state distracted presses to the dardan gate
scarce the whole people stop his desperate course while strong affliction gives the feeble force grief tears his heart and drives him to and fro
in all the raging impotence of woe at length he roll in dust and thus begun imploring all and naming one by one
ah let me let me go where sorrow calls i only i will issue from your walls guide or companion friends
i ask ye none and bow before the murderer of my son my grief perhaps his pity may engage perhaps at least he may respect my age
a man like me one not exempt from age and misery vigorous no more as when his young embrace begot this pest of me and all my race
he has a father too how many valiant son in early bloom has that cursed hand send headlong to the tomb
o had thy gentle spirit pass in peace the son expiring in the sire embrace while both thy parents wept the fatal hour and bending er thee mix the tender shower
thee stern_hector last thy loss divinely brave sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave some comfort that had been some sad relief to melt in full satiety of grief
thus wail the father grovelling on the ground and all the eyes of ilion stream around amidst her matrons hecuba appears a mourning princess and a train in tears
ah why has heaven prolong this hated breath patient of horrors to behold thy death stern_hector late thy parents pride and joy the boast of nations

but not as yet the fatal news had spread to fair andromache of stern_hector dead as yet no messenger had told his fate not en his stay without the scaean gate
o fatal change become in one sad day a senseless corse inanimated clay far in the close recesses of the dome pensive she plied the melancholy loom
a growing work employ her secret hours confusedly gay with intermingled flowers her fair haired handmaids heat the brazen urn the bath preparing for her lord return in vain alas
her lord returns no more unbathed he lies and bleeds along the shore now from the walls the clamours reach her ear and all her members shake with sudden fear
forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls and thus astonish to her maids she calls illustration the bath the bath
my faltering knees their trembling frame desert a pulse unusual flutters at my heart some strange disaster some reverse of fate ye gods avert it
ah follow me she cried what plaintive noise invades my ear tis sure my mother voice threats the trojan state
far be the omen which my thought suggest but much i fear my stern_hector dauntless breast confronts achilles chased along the plain shut from our walls
and sought for glory in the jaws of fate perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath now quench for ever in the arms of death
she spoke and furious with distracted pace fears in her heart and anguish in her face flies through the dome the maids her steps pursue and mounts the walls and sends around her view
i fear i fear him slain safe in the crowd he ever scorn to wait too soon her eyes the killing object found
the godlike stern_hector dragg along the ground a sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes she faints she falls her breath her colour flies
her hair fair ornaments the braids that bound the net that held them and the wreath that crown the veil and diadem flew far away the gift of venus on her bridal day
around a train of weeping sisters stands to raise her sinking with assistant hands scarce from the verge of death recall again she faints or but recovers to complain
illustration andromache fainting on the wall andromache fainting on the wall wretched husband of a wretched wife born with one fate to one unhappy life
for sure one star its baneful beam display on priam roof and hippoplacia shade from different parents different climes we came
at different periods yet our fate the same why was my birth to great aetion owed and why was all that tender care
bestow would i had never been thou the ghost of my dead husband miserably lost thou to the dismal realms for ever gone
and i abandon desolate alone an only child once comfort of my pains sad product now of hapless love remains no more to smile upon his sire no friend to help him now
no father to defend for should he scape the sword the common doom what wrongs attend him and what griefs to come
the day that to the shades the father sends robs the sad orphan of his father friends he wretched outcast of mankind appears for ever sad for ever bathed in tears amongst the happy unregarded he hangs on the robe or trembles at the knee while those his father former bounty fed nor reach the goblet nor divide the bread the kindest but his present wants allay
even from his own paternal roof expell some stranger ploughs his patrimonial field to leave him wretched the succeeding day frugal compassion
heedless they who boast both parents still nor feel what he has lost shall cry begone thy father feasts not here
the wretch obeys retiring with a tear thus wretched thus retiring all in tears to my sad soul astyanax appears forced by repeated insults to return and to his widow mother vainly mourn
he who with tender delicacy bred with princes sported and on dainties fed and when still evening gave him up to rest sunk soft in down upon the nurse breast must ah what must he not
whom ilion calls astyanax from her well guarded walls is now that name no more unhappy boy since now no more thy father guards his troy
but thou my stern_hector liest exposed in air far from thy parents and thy consort care whose hand in vain directed by her love the martial scarf and robe of triumph wove
now to devouring flames be these a prey useless to thee from this accursed day yet let the sacrifice at least be paid an honour to the living not the dead
so spake the mournful dame her matrons hear sigh back her sighs and answer tear with tear book xxiii argument funeral games in honour of patroclus
after the funeral feast he retires to the sea shore where falling asleep the ghost of his friend appears to him and demand the rites of burial the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre
achilles and the myrmidons do honours to the body of patroclus the funeral procession and the offering their hair to the dead
achilles sacrifice several animals and lastly twelve trojan captives at the pile then sets fire to it he pays libations to the winds which at the instance of iris rise and raise the flames
when the pile has burned all night they gather the bones place them in an urn of gold and raise the tomb
achilles institutes the funeral games the chariot race the fight of the caestus the wrestling the foot race the single combat the discus the shooting with arrows the darting the javelin the various descriptions of which and the various success of the several antagonists make the greatest part of the book
the night following the ghost of patroclus appears to achilles the one and thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile the two and thirtieth in burning it and the three and thirtieth in the games
in this book end the thirtieth day the scene is generally on the sea shore thus humbled in the dust the pensive train through the sad city
the grecians seek their ships and clear the strand all but the martial myrmidonian band these yet assembled great achilles holds and the stern_hector purpose of his mind unfolds not yet my brave companions of the war release your smoking coursers from the car
mourn her hero slain the body soil with dust and black with gore lies on broad hellespont resounding shore but with his chariot each in order led perform due honours to patroclus dead
ere yet from rest or food we seek relief some rites remain to glut our rage of grief the troops obey and thrice in order led
achilles first their coursers round the dead and thrice their sorrows and laments renew tears bathe their arms and tears the sands bedew
but chief pelides thick succeeding sighs burst from his heart and torrents from his eyes his slaughtering hands yet red with blood he laid on his dead friend cold breast and thus he said
for such a warrior thetis aids their woe melts their strong hearts and bids their eyes to flow all hail patroclus let thy honour ghost hear and rejoice on pluto dreary coast behold
to the dogs his carcase i resign and twelve sad victims of the trojan line sacred to vengeance instant shall expire their lives effused around thy funeral pyre
achilles promise is complete the bloody stern_hector stretch before thy feet lo gloomy he said and horrible to view before the bier the bleeding stern_hector threw prone on the dust
the myrmidons around unbraced their armour and the steeds unbound all to achilles sable ship repair frequent and full the genial feast to share
now from the well fed swine black smokes aspire the bristly victims hissing er the fire the huge ox bellowing falls with feebler cries expires the goat the sheep in silence dies
around the hero prostrate body flow in one promiscuous stream the reeking blood and now a band of argive monarchs brings the glorious victor to the king of kings
the attending heralds as by office bound with kindled flames the tripod vase surround to cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore they urged in vain the chief refused and swore
from his dead friend the pensive warrior went with steps unwilling to the regal tent no drop shall touch me by almighty which_jove
the first and greatest of the gods above till on the pyre i place thee till i rear the grassy mound and clip thy sacred hair
howe er reluctant as i am i stay and share your feast but with the dawn of day king of men
it claims thy royal care that greece the warrior funeral pile prepare and bid the forests fall such rites are paid to heroes slumbering in eternal shade
some ease at least those pious rites may give and soothe my sorrows while i bear to live then when his earthly part shall mount in fire let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire
he spoke they hear him and the word obey the rage of hunger and of thirst allay then ease in sleep the labours of the day
but great pelides stretch along the shore where dash on rocks the broken billows roar lies inly groaning while on either hand the martial myrmidons confusedly stand
tired with his chase around the trojan wall hush by the murmurs of the rolling deep at length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep
along the grass his languid members fall when lo the shade before his closing eyes of sad patroclus rose or seem to rise
in the same robe he living wore he came in stature voice and pleasing look the same the form familiar hover d
o er his head and sleeps achilles thus the phantom said sleeps my achilles his patroclus dead living i seem his dearest tenderest care
but now forgot i wander in the air let my pale corse the rites of burial know and give me entrance in the realms below
till then the spirit finds no resting place but here and there the unbodied spectres chase the vagrant dead around the dark abode forbid to cross the irremeable flood
now give thy hand for to the farther shore when once we pass the soul returns no more when once the last funereal flames ascend no more shall meet achilles and his friend no more our thought to those we loved make known or quit the dearest to converse alone
me fate has sever from the son of earth the fate fore doom that waited from my birth thee too it waits before the trojan wall even great and godlike thou art doom to fall
together have we lived together bred one house received us and one table fed that golden urn thy goddess mother gave may mix our ashes in one common grave
hear then and as in fate and love we join ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine and is it thou
he answers to my sight once more return st thou from the realms of night more than brother think each office paid whate er can rest a discontented shade but grant one last embrace unhappy boy
afford at least that melancholy joy he said and with his longing arms essay in vain to grasp the visionary shade
confused he wakes amazement breaks the bands of golden sleep and starting from the sands pensive he muses with uplifted hands tis true tis certain man though dead retains part of himself the immortal mind remains the form subsists without the body aid aerial semblance and an empty shade
this night my friend so late in battle lost stood at my side a pensive plaintive ghost even now familiar as in life he came
like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly and hears a feeble lamentable cry alas how different yet how like the same
thus while he spoke each eye grew big with tears and now the rosy finger morn appears shows every mournful face with tears erspread and glares on the pale visage of the dead
but agamemnon as the rites demand with mules and waggons sends a chosen band to load the timber and the pile to rear a charge consign to merion faithful care
with proper instruments they take the road axes to cut and ropes to sling the load first march the heavy mules securely slow er hills er dales er crags er rocks they go
jumping high er the shrubs of the rough ground rattle the clattering cars and the shock axles bound but when arrived at ida spreading woods
fair ida water with descending floods loud sounds the axe redoubling strokes on strokes on all sides round the forest hurls her oaks headlong
deep echoing groan the thickets brown then rustling crackling crashing thunder down the wood the grecians cleave prepared to burn and the slow mules the same rough road return
the sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore such charge was given them to the sandy shore there on the spot which great achilles show they eased their shoulders and disposed the load circling around the place where times to come
the hero bids his martial troops appear high on their cars in all the pomp of war each in refulgent arms his limbs attires
shall view patroclus and achilles tomb all mount their chariots combatants and squires the chariots first proceed a shining train
then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain next these the melancholy band appear amidst lay dead patroclus on the bier er all the corse their scattered locks they throw achilles next oppress with mighty woe supporting with his hands the hero head bends er the extended body of the dead
but great achilles stands apart in prayer and from his head divides the yellow hair those curling locks which from his youth he vow
patroclus decent on the appointed ground they place and heap the sylvan pile around and sacred grew to sperchius honour flood
then sighing to the deep his locks he cast and roll his eyes around the watery waste sperchius whose waves in mazy errors lost delightful roll along my native coast
to whom we vainly vow at our return these locks to fall and hecatombs to burn full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice where to the day
thy silver fountains rise and where in shade of consecrated bowers thy altars stand perfumed with native flowers so vow my father but he vow in vain
no more achilles sees his native plain in that vain hope these hairs no longer grow patroclus bears them to the shades below
thus er patroclus while the hero pray on his cold hand the sacred lock he laid once more afresh the grecian sorrows flow and now the sun had set upon their woe
but to the king of men thus spoke the chief enough atrides give the troops relief permit the mourning legions to retire and let the chiefs alone attend the pyre the pious care be ours the dead to burn
he said the people to their ships return while those deputed to inter the slain heap with a rising pyramid the plain
a hundred foot in length a hundred wide the growing structure spreads on every side high on the top the manly corse they lay and well fed sheep and sable oxen slay achilles covered with their fat the dead
and the piled victims round the body spread then jars of honey and of fragrant oil suspends around low bending er the pile
four sprightly coursers with a deadly groan pour forth their lives and on the pyre are thrown of nine large dogs domestic at his board fall two selected to attend their lord
then last of all and horrible to tell sad sacrifice twelve trojan captives fell on these the rage of fire victorious preys involves and joins them in one common blaze
smear with the bloody rites he stands on high and calls the spirit with a dreadful cry all hail patroclus let thy vengeful ghost hear and exult on pluto dreary coast
behold achilles promise fully paid twelve trojan heroes offer to thy shade but heavier fate on stern_hector corse attend saved from the flames for hungry dogs to rend
so spake he threatening but the gods made vain his threat and guard inviolate the slain celestial venus hover o er his head and roseate unguents heavenly fragrance
shed she watch him all the night and all the day and drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey nor sacred phoebus less
he pour around a veil of gather air and kept the nerves undried the flesh entire against the solar beam and sirian fire
nor yet the pile where dead patroclus lies smokes nor as yet the sullen flames arise but fast beside achilles stood in prayer invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air and victims promised and libations cast to gentle zephyr and the boreal blast
employ his care illustration the funeral pile of patroclus the funeral pile of patroclus he call the aerial powers along the skies to breathe and whisper to the fires to rise
the winged iris heard the hero call and instant hasten to their airy hall where in old zephyr open courts on high sat all the blustering brethren of the sky
she shone amidst them on her painted bow the rocky pavement glitter with the show all from the banquet rise and each invites the various goddess to partake the rites
not so the dame replied i haste to go to sacred ocean and the floods below even now our solemn hecatombs attend and heaven is feasting on the world green end with righteous ethiops uncorrupted train
far on the extremest limits of the main but peleus son entreats with sacrifice the western spirit and the north to rise
swift as the word she vanish from their view swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar and heaps on heaps the clouds are toss before
to the wide main then stooping from the skies the heaving deeps in watery mountain rise troy feels the blast along her shaking walls
let on patroclus pile your blast be driven and bear the blazing honours high to heaven till on the pile the gather tempest falls
the structure crackles in the roaring fires and all the night the plenteous flame aspires all night achilles hails patroclus soul with large libations from the golden bowl
as a poor father helpless and undone mourns er the ashes of an only son takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn and pours in tears ere
yet they close the urn so stay achilles circling round the shore so watch the flames till now they flame no more
the morning planet told the approach of light and fast behind aurora warmer ray er the broad ocean pour the golden day then sank the blaze the pile no longer burn and to their caves the whistling winds return across the thracian sea their course they bore
then parting from the pile he ceased to weep and sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep exhausted with his grief meanwhile the crowd of thronging grecians round achilles stood the tumult waked him from his eyes he shook unwilling slumber and the chiefs bespoke
twas when emerging through the shades of night the ruffled sea beneath their passage roar ye kings and princes of the achaian name
first let us quench the yet remaining flame with sable wine then as the rites direct the hero bones with careful view select
amidst the heap and obvious to the eye the rest around the margin will be seen promiscuous steeds and immolated men
apart and easy to be known they lie these wrapp in double cauls of fat prepare and in the golden vase dispose with care there let them rest with decent honour laid
meantime erect the tomb with pious hands a common structure on the humble sands hereafter greece some nobler work may raise and late posterity record our praise
the greeks obey where yet the embers glow wide er the pile the sable wine they throw and deep subsides the ashy heap below
till i shall follow to the infernal shade next the white bones his sad companions place with tears collected in the golden vase
that done they bid the sepulchre aspire and cast the deep foundations round the pyre high in the midst they heap the swelling bed of rising earth memorial of the dead
the sacred relics to the tent they bore the urn a veil of linen covered er the swarming populace the chief detains and leads amidst a wide extent of plains
there placed them round then from the ships proceeds a train of oxen mules and stately steeds vases and tripods for the funeral games resplendent brass and more resplendent dames
first stood the prizes to reward the force of rapid racers in the dusty course a woman for the first in beauty bloom skill in the needle and the labouring loom and a large vase where two bright handles rise of twenty measures its capacious size
the second victor claims a mare unbroke big with a mule unknowing of the yoke the third a charger yet untouch by flame four ample measures held the shining frame two golden talents for the fourth were placed an ample double bowl contents the last
these in fair order ranged upon the plain the hero rising thus address the train behold the prizes valiant greeks decreed to the brave rulers of the racing steed
prizes which none beside ourself could gain should our immortal coursers take the plain a race unrivall which from ocean god peleus received and on his son bestow
but this no time our vigour to display nor suit with them the games of this sad day lost is patroclus now that wont to deck their flowing manes and sleek their glossy neck
sad as they shared in human grief they stand and trail those graceful honours on the sand let others for the noble task prepare who trust the courser and the flying car
fired at his word the rival racers rise but far the first eumelus hopes the prize famed though pieria for the fleetest breed and skill to manage the high bounding steed
with equal ardour bold tydides swell the steeds of tros beneath his yoke compell which late obey the dardan chiefs command
then great_menelaus his podargus brings and the famed courser of the king of kings whom rich echepolus more rich than brave to scape the wars to agamemnon gave ćthe her name at home to end his days base wealth preferring to eternal praise
when scarce a god redeem him from his hand next him antilochus demand the course with beating heart and cheers his pylian horse
experienced wise_nestor gives his son the reins directs his judgment and his heat restrains nor idly warns the hoary sire nor hears the prudent son with unattending ears
my son though youthful ardour fire thy breast the gods have loved thee and with arts have bless neptune and which_jove on thee conferr the skill swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel
fear not thy rival though for swiftness known compare those rival judgment and thy own it is not strength but art obtains the prize and to be swift is less than to be wise_nestor
to guide thy conduct little precept needs but slow and past their vigour are my steeds tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
the dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks by art the pilot through the boiling deep and howling tempest steers the fearless ship and tis the artist wins the glorious course not those who trust in chariots and in horse
in vain unskilful to the goal they strive and short or wide the ungovern courser drive while with sure skill though with inferior steeds the knowing racer to his end proceeds fix on the goal his eye foreruns the course his hand unerring steers the steady horse and now contracts or now extends the rein observing still the foremost on the plain
mark then the goal tis easy to be found yon aged trunk a cubit from the ground of some once stately oak the last remains or hardy fir unperish with the rains
inclosed with stones conspicuous from afar and round a circle for the wheeling car some tomb perhaps of old the dead to grace or then as now the limit of a race
bear close to this and warily proceed a little bending to the left hand steed but urge the right and give him all the reins while thy strict hand his fellow head restrains and turns him short till doubling as they roll the wheel round naves appear to brush the goal
clear of the stony heap direct the course lest through incaution failing thou mayst be a joy to others a reproach to me
so shalt thou pass the goal secure of mind and leave unskilful swiftness far behind though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed which bore adrastus of celestial breed or the famed race through all the regions known that whirl the car of proud laomedon
yet not to break the car or lame the horse thus nought unsaid the much advising sage concludes then sat stiff with unwieldy age
next bold meriones was seen to rise the last but not least ardent for the prize they mount their seats the lots their place dispose roll in his helmet these achilles throws
young wise_nestor leads the race eumelus then and next the brother of the king of men thy lot meriones the fourth was cast and far the bravest diomed was last
they stand in order an impatient train pelides points the barrier on the plain and sends before old phoenix to the place to mark the racers and to judge the race
at once the coursers from the barrier bound the lifted scourges all at once resound their heart their eyes their voice they send before
and up the champaign thunder from the shore thick where they drive the dusty clouds arise and the lost courser in the whirlwind flies loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined float in their speed and dance upon the wind
the smoking chariots rapid as they bound now seem to touch the sky and now the ground while hot for fame and conquest all their care each er his flying courser hung in air
erect with ardour poised upon the rein they pant they stretch they shout along the plain now the last compass fetch around the goal
at the near prize each gathers all his soul each burns with double hope with double pain tears up the shore and thunders toward the main
first flew eumelus on pheretian steeds with those of tros bold diomed succeeds close on eumelus back they puff the wind and seem just mounting on his car behind
then had he lost or left a doubtful prize but angry phoebus to tydides flies strikes from his hand the scourge and renders vain his matchless horses labour on the plain
full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze and hovering er their stretching shadows sees rage fills his eye with anguish to survey snatch from his hope the glories of the day
the fraud celestial pallas sees with pain springs to her knight and gives the scourge again and fills his steeds with vigour
at a stroke she breaks his rival chariot from the yoke no more their way the startled horses held the car reversed came rattling on the field
shot headlong from his seat beside the wheel prone on the dust the unhappy master fell his batter face and elbows strike the ground
nose mouth and front one undistinguish wound grief stops his voice a torrent drowns his eyes before him far the glad tydides flies minerva spirit drives his matchless pace and crowns him victor of the labour race
the next though distant great_menelaus succeeds while thus young wise_nestor animates his steeds now now my generous pair exert your force not that we hope to match tydides horse since great minerva wings their rapid way and gives their lord the honours of the day but reach atrides
shall his mare outgo your swiftness vanquish by a female foe through your neglect if lagging on the plain the last ignoble gift be all we gain
no more shall wise_nestor hand your food supply the old man fury rise and ye die haste then yon narrow road before our sight presents the occasion could we use it right
thus he the coursers at their master threat with quicker steps the sounding champaign beat and now antilochus with nice survey observes the compass of the hollow way
twas where by force of wintry torrents torn fast by the road a precipice was worn here where but one could pass to shun the throng the spartan hero chariot smoked along
close up the venturous youth resolves to keep still edging near and bears him toward the steep atrides trembling casts his eye below and wonders at the rashness of his foe
hold stay your steeds what madness thus to ride this narrow way take larger field he cried or both must fall atrides cried in vain he flies more fast and throws up all the rein
far as an able arm the disk can send when youthful rival their full force extend so far antilochus thy chariot flew before the king he cautious backward drew his horse compell foreboding in his fears the rattling ruin of the clashing cars the floundering coursers rolling on the plain and conquest lost through frantic haste to gain
but thus upbraids his rival as he flies go furious youth ungenerous and unwise go but expect not i ll the prize resign add perjury to fraud and make it thine
your rival destitute of youthful force with fainting knees shall labour in the course and yield the glory yours the steeds obey already at their heels they wing their way and seem already to retrieve the day
then to his steeds with all his force he cries be swift be vigorous and regain the prize meantime the grecians in a ring beheld
them was the cretan king high on a rising ground above the ring the monarch sat from whence with sure survey he well observed the chief who led the way and heard from far his animating cries and saw the foremost steed with sharpen eyes
the coursers bounding er the dusty field the first who mark on whose broad front a blaze of shining white like the full moon stood obvious to the sight
he saw and rising to the greeks begun are yonder horse discern by me alone or can ye all another chief survey and other steeds than lately led the way
those though the swiftest by some god withheld lie sure disabled in the middle field for since the goal they doubled round the plain i search to find them but i search in vain
perchance the reins forsook the driver hand and turn too short he tumbled on the strand shot from the chariot while his coursers stray with frantic fury from the destined way
rise then some other and inform my sight for these dim eyes perhaps discern not right yet sure he seems to judge by shape and air the great ćtolian chief renown in war
thy tongue too hastily confers the prize of those who view the course nor sharpest eyed nor youngest yet the readiest to decide
eumelus steeds high bounding in the chase still as at first unrivall lead the race i well discern him as he shakes the rein and hear his shouts victorious er the plain
old man oileus rashly thus replies thus he idomeneus incensed rejoin barbarous of word and arrogant of mind contentious prince of all the greeks beside the last in merit as the first in pride
to vile reproach what answer can we make a goblet or a tripod let us stake and be the king the judge
the most unwise will learn their rashness when they pay the price he said and oilean_ajax by mad passion borne stern_hector had replied fierce scorn enhancing scorn to fell extremes
but thetis godlike son awful amidst them rose and thus begun forbear ye chiefs reproachful to contend much would ye blame should others thus offend and lo
the approaching steeds your contest end no sooner had he spoke but thundering near drives through a stream of dust the charioteer
his car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold refulgent through the cloud no eye could find the track his flying wheels had left behind and the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace
high er his head the circling lash he wields his bounding horses scarcely touch the fields so swift it seem a flight and not a race
now victor at the goal tydides stands quits his bright car and springs upon the sands from the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream the well plied whip is hung athwart the beam with joy brave sthenelus receives the prize
the tripod vase and dame with radiant eyes these to the ships his train triumphant leads the chief himself unyokes the panting steeds
young wise_nestor follows who by art not force erpass atrides second in the course behind atrides urged the race more near than to the courser in his swift career
the following car just touching with his heel and brushing with his tail the whirling wheel such and so narrow now the space between the rival late so distant on the green
so soon swift ćthe her lost ground regain one length one moment had the race obtain merion pursued at greater distance still with tardier coursers and inferior skill
last came admetus thy unhappy son slow dragged the steeds his batter chariot on achilles saw and pitying thus begun behold
the man whose matchless art surpass the son of greece the ablest yet the last fortune denies but justice bids us pay since great tydides bears the first away
to him the second honours of the day the greeks consent with loud applauding cries and then eumelus had received the prize
but youthful wise_nestor jealous of his fame the award opposes and asserts his claim think not he cries i tamely will resign peleus son
the mare so justly mine what if the gods the skilful to confound have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground
perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice and vows omitted forfeited the prize if yet distinction to thy friend to show and please a soul desirous to bestow
view thy store of beauteous handmaids steeds and shining ore an ample present let him thence receive and greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give
some gift must grace eumelus but this my prize i never shall forego this who but touches warriors is my foe
thus spake the youth nor did his word offend pleased with the well turn flattery of a friend achilles smiled the gift proposed he cried antilochus
we shall ourself provide with plates of brass the corslet cover o er the same renown asteropaeus wore whose glittering margins raised with silver shine no vulgar gift eumelus shall be thine
his bosom glows with generous joy then great_menelaus rose the herald placed the sceptre in his hands and still the clamour of the shouting bands
not without cause incensed at wise_nestor son and inly grieving thus the king begun the praise of wisdom in thy youth obtain an act so rash antilochus has stain
he said automedon at his command the corslet brought and gave it to his hand distinguish by his friend robb of my glory and my just reward to you grecians
be my wrong declared so not a leader shall our conduct blame or judge me envious of a rival fame but shall not we ourselves the truth maintain
what needs appealing in a fact so plain what greek shall blame me if i bid thee rise and vindicate by oath th ill gotten prize
rise if thou darest before thy chariot stand the driving scourge high lifted in thy hand and touch thy steeds and swear thy whole intent was but to conquer not to circumvent
the prudent chief with calm attention heard then mildly thus excuse if youth have err superior as thou art forgive the offence
swear by that god whose liquid arms surround the globe and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground nor i thy equal or in years or sense
thou know st the errors of unripen age weak are its counsels headlong is its rage the prize i quit if thou thy wrath resign the mare or aught thou ask st be freely thine ere
i become from thy dear friendship torn hateful to thee and to the gods forsworn so spoke antilochus and at the word the mare contested to the king restored
joy swells his soul as when the vernal grain lifts the green ear above the springing plain the fields their vegetable life renew and laugh and glitter with the morning dew such joy the spartan shining face erspread and lifted his gay heart while thus he said still may our souls generous youth
agree tis now atrides turn to yield to thee rash heat perhaps a moment might control not break the settled temper of thy soul
not but my friend tis still the wiser way to waive contention with superior sway for ah how few who should like thee offend like thee have talents to regain the friend
to plead indulgence and thy fault atone suffice thy father merit and thy own generous alike for me the sire and son have greatly suffer and have greatly done
he said and pleased his passion to command resign the courser to noemon hand friend of the youthful chief himself content
i yield that all may know my soul can bend nor is my pride preferr before my friend the shining charger to his vessel sent
the golden talents merion next obtain the fifth reward the double bowl remain achilles this to reverend wise_nestor bears and thus the purpose of his gift declares
accept thou this sacred sire he said in dear memorial of patroclus dead dead and for ever lost patroclus lies for ever snatch from our desiring eyes
take thou this token of a grateful heart though tis not thine to hurl the distant dart the quoit to toss the ponderous mace to wield or urge the race or wrestle on the field
he said and placed the goblet at his side with joy the venerable king replied wisely and well my son thy word have proved
thy pristine vigour age has overthrown but left the glory of the past thy own a senior honour and a friend beloved
too true it is deserted of my strength these wither arms and limbs have fail at length oh had i now
that force i felt of yore known through buprasium and the pylian shore victorious then in every solemn game ordain to amarynces mighty name the brave epeians gave my glory way
ćtolians pylians all resign the day i quell clytomedes in fights of hand and backward hurl ancaeus on the sand surpass iphyclus in the swift career phyleus and polydorus with the spear
for the famed twins impatient to survey prize after prize by wise_nestor borne away sprung to their car and with united pains
the son of actor won the prize of horse but won by numbers not by art or force one lash the coursers while one ruled the reins
such once i was now to these tasks succeeds a younger race that emulate our deeds i yield alas to age who must not yield
though once the foremost hero of the field go thou my son by generous friendship led with martial honours decorate the dead while pleased i take the gift thy hands present
pledge of benevolence and kind intent rejoiced of all the numerous greeks to see not one but honours sacred age and me
those due distinctions thou so well canst pay may the just gods return another day proud of the gift thus spake the full of days achilles heard him prouder of the praise
a stately mule as yet by toils unbroke of six years age unconscious of the yoke is to the circus led and firmly bound next stands a goblet massy large and round
let greece excite two heroes equal to this hardy fight who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke and rush beneath the long descending stroke
the prizes next are order to the field for the bold champions who the caestus wield achilles rising thus on whom apollo shall the palm bestow and whom the greeks supreme by conquest know
this mule his dauntless labours shall repay the vanquish bear the massy bowl away this dreadful combat great epeus chose
high er the crowd enormous bulk he rose and seized the beast and thus began to say stand forth some man to bear the bowl away
price of his ruin for who dares deny this mule my right the undoubted victor i others tis own in fields of battle shine
then let my foe draw near but first his certain fortune know secure this hand shall his whole frame confound mash all his bones and all his body pound
but the first honours of this fight are mine for who excels in all so let his friends be nigh a needful train
to heave the batter carcase off the plain the giant spoke and in a stupid gaze the host beheld him silent with amaze
twas thou euryalus who durst aspire to meet his might and emulate thy sire the great mecistheus who in days of yore
him great tydides urges to contend warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend officious with the cincture girds him round and to his wrist the gloves of death are bound
amid the circle now each champion stands and poises high in air his iron hands with clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close
in theban games the noblest trophy bore the games ordain dead oedipus to grace and singly vanquish the cadmean race their crackling jaws re echo to the blows and painful sweat from all their members flows
at length epeus dealt a weighty blow full on the cheek of his unwary foe beneath that ponderous arm resistless sway down
as a large fish when winds and waters roar by some huge billow dash against the shore lies panting not less batter with his wound the bleeding hero pants upon the ground
to rear his fallen foe the victor lends scornful his hand and gives him to his friends whose arms support him reeling through the throng and dragging his disabled legs along nodding his head hangs down his shoulder er his mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore wrapp round in mists he lies and lost to thought his friends receive the bowl too dearly bought
dropp he nerveless and extended lay the third bold game achilles next demand and calls the wrestlers to the level sands
a massy tripod for the victor lies of twice six oxen its reputed price and next the loser spirits to restore a female captive valued but at four
scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop when tower like oilean_ajax and ulysses rose amid the ring each nervous rival stands embracing rigid with implicit hands
below their planted feet at distance fix like two strong rafters which the builder forms proof to the wintry winds and howling storms their tops connected but at wider space fix on the centre stands their solid base
now to the grasp each manly body bends the humid sweat from every pore descends their bones resound with blows sides shoulders thighs swell to each gripe and bloody tumours rise
nor could ulysses for his art renown o erturn the strength of oilean_ajax on the ground nor could the strength of oilean_ajax overthrow the watchful caution of his artful foe
close lock above their heads and arms are mix while the long strife even tired the lookers on thus to ulysses spoke great ajax_telamon
or let me lift thee chief or lift thou me prove we our force and which_jove the rest decree
he said and straining heaved him off the ground with matchless strength that time ulysses found the strength to evade and where the nerves combine his ankle struck the giant fell supine ulysses following on his bosom lies shouts of applause run rattling through the skies
oilean_ajax to lift ulysses next essays he barely stirr him but he could not raise his knee lock fast the foe attempt denied and grappling close they tumbled side by side
defiled with honourable dust they roll still breathing strife and unsubdued of soul again they rage again to combat rise when great achilles thus divides the prize your noble vigour my friends restrain nor weary out your generous strength in vain
ye both have won let others who excel now prove that prowess you have proved so well the hero word the willing chiefs obey from their tired bodies
the youths contending in the rapid race a silver urn that full six measures held by none in weight or workmanship excell sidonian artists taught the frame to shine elaborate with artifice divine whence tyrian sailors did the prize transport and gave to thoas at the lemnian port from him descended
wipe the dust away and clothed anew the following games survey and now succeed the gifts ordain to grace good eunaeus heir d
the glorious gift and for lycaon spared to brave patroclus gave the rich reward now the same hero funeral rites to grace it stands the prize of swiftness in the race
a well fed ox was for the second placed and half a talent must content the last achilles rising then bespoke the train
the hero said and starting from his place oilean_ajax rise to the race ulysses next and he whose speed surpass his youthful equals wise_nestor son the last
ranged in a line the ready racers stand pelides points the barrier with his hand all start at once oileus led the race the next ulysses measuring pace with pace behind him diligently close he sped as closely following as the running thread
who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain stand forth and bear these prizes from the plain the spindle follows and displays the charms of the fair spinster breast and moving arms
graceful in motion thus his foe he plies and treads each footstep ere the dust can rise his glowing breath upon his shoulders plays
the admiring greeks loud acclamations raise to him they give their wishes hearts and eyes and send their souls before him as he flies
now three times turn in prospect of the goal the panting chief to pallas lifts his soul assist goddess thus in thought he pray
and present at his thought descends the maid buoy by her heavenly force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb
all fierce and ready now the prize to gain unhappy oilean_ajax stumbles on the plain erturn by pallas where the slippery shore was clogg with slimy dung and mingled gore
the self same place beside patroclus pyre where late the slaughter victims fed the fire besmear with filth and blotted er with clay
obscene to sight the rueful racer lay the well fed bull the second prize he shared and left the urn ulysses rich reward
then grasping by the horn the mighty beast the baffled hero thus the greeks address accursed fate the conquest i forego a mortal i
a goddess was my foe she urged her favourite on the rapid way and pallas not ulysses won the day
antilochus more humorous than the rest takes the last prize and takes it with a jest why with our wiser elders should we strive
thus sourly wail he sputtering dirt and gore a burst of laughter echoed through the shore the gods still love them and they always thrive
ye see to oilean_ajax i must yield the prize he to ulysses still more aged and wise_nestor a green old age unconscious of decays that proves the hero born in better days
behold his vigour in this active race achilles only boasts a swifter pace for who can match achilles he who can must yet be more than hero more than man
the effect succeeds the speech pelides cries thy artful praise deserves a better prize nor greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll
receive a talent of the purest gold the youth departs content the host admire the son of wise_nestor worthy of his sire
next these a buckler spear and helm he brings cast on the plain the brazen burden rings arms which of late divine sarpedon wore and great patroclus in short triumph bore
whoever dares deserve so rich a prize now grace the lists before our army sight and sheathed in steel provoke his foe to fight
who first the jointed armour shall explore and stain his rival mail with issuing gore the sword asteropaeus possess of old a thracian blade distinct with studs of gold
shall pay the stroke and grace the striker side these arms in common let the chiefs divide for each brave champion when the combat end a sumptuous banquet at our tents attends
stand forth the bravest of our host he cries fierce at the word uprose great tydeus son and the huge bulk of oilean_ajax ajax_telamon
clad in refulgent steel on either hand the dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand louring they meet tremendous to the sight each argive bosom beats with fierce delight
opposed in arms not long they idly stood but thrice they closed and thrice the charge renew a furious pass the spear of oilean_ajax made through the broad shield but at the corslet stay
not thus the foe his javelin aim above the buckler margin at the neck he drove but greece now trembling for her hero life bade share the honours and surcease the strife
then hurl the hero thundering on the ground a mass of iron an enormous round whose weight and size the circling greeks admire rude from the furnace and but shaped by fire
this mighty quoit aetion wont to rear and from his whirling arm dismiss in air the giant by achilles slain he stow d
yet still the victor due tydides gains with him the sword and studded belt remains among his spoil this memorable load
for this he bids those nervous artists vie that teach the disk to sound along the sky let him whose might can hurl this bowl arise
who farthest hurls it take it as his prize if he be one enrich with large domain of downs for flocks and arable for grain small stock of iron needs that man provide his hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied from hence nor ask the neighbouring city aid for ploughshares wheels and all the rural trade
stern_hector polypoetes stepp before the throng and great leonteus more than mortal strong whose force with rival forces to oppose
uprose great oilean_ajax up epeus rose each stood in order first epeus threw high er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew
leonteus next a little space surpass and third the strength of godlike oilean_ajax cast er both their marks it flew till fiercely flung from polypoetes arm the discus sung
far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws that distant falls among the grazing cows so past them all the rapid circle flies
those who in skilful archery contend he next invites the twanging bow to bend and twice ten axes casts amidst the round ten double edged and ten that singly wound
the mast which late a first rate galley bore the hero fixes in the sandy shore to the tall top a milk white dove they tie the trembling mark at which their arrows fly
his friends while loud applauses shake the skies with force conjoin heave off the weighty prize whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird shall bear these two edged axes terrible in war
he said experienced merion took the word and skilful teucer in the helm they threw their lots inscribed and forth the latter flew
the single he whose shaft divides the cord swift from the string the sounding arrow flies but flies unbless no grateful sacrifice no firstling lambs unheedful
turn aside err from the dove yet cut the cord that tied adown the mainmast fell the parted string and the free bird to heaven displays her wing
sea shores and skies with loud applause resound and merion eager meditates the wound he takes the bow directs the shaft above and following with his eye the soaring dove implores the god to speed it through the skies with vows of firstling lambs and grateful sacrific
the dove in airy circle as she wheels amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels quite through and through the point its passage found and at his feet fell bloody to the ground
didst thou vow to phoebus patron of the shaft and bow for this thy well aim arrow the wounded bird ere yet
she breathed her last with flagging wings alighted on the mast a moment hung and spread her pinions there then sudden dropp and left her life in air
from the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise and to the ships brave merion bears the prize to close the funeral games achilles last a massy spear amid the circle placed and ample charger of unsullied frame
with flowers high wrought not blacken yet by flame for these he bids the heroes prove their art whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart
with joy pelides saw the honour paid rose to the monarch and respectful said thee first in virtue as in power supreme king of nations
here too great merion hopes the noble prize nor here disdain the king of men to rise all thy greeks proclaim
in every martial game thy worth attest and know thee both their greatest and their best take then the prize but let brave merion bear this beamy javelin in thy brother war
pleased from the hero lips his praise to hear the king to merion gives the brazen spear but set apart for sacred use commands the glittering charger to talthybius hands

to obtain the body of stern_hector then down her bow the winged iris drives and swift at priam mournful court arrives where the sad son beside their father throne sat bathed in tears and answer groan with groan

obedient to your call if in yon camp your powers have doom my fall content by the same hand let me expire
add to the slaughter son the wretched sire one cold embrace at least may be allow and my last tears flow mingled with his blood

with ten pure talents from the richest mine and last a large well labour bowl had place the pledge of treaties once with friendly thrace seem all too mean the stores he could employ for one last look to buy him back to troy
two tripods next and twice two chargers shine lo the sad father frantic with his pain around him furious drives his menial train
in vain each slave with duteous care attends each office hurts him and each face offends what make ye here officious crowds
he cries hence nor obtrude your anguish on my eyes have ye no griefs at home to fix ye there am i the only object of despair

the sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey inglorious son of an unhappy sire why did not all in stern_hector cause expire
wretch that i am my bravest offspring slain you the disgrace of priam house remain mestor the brave renown in ranks of war with troilus dreadful on his rushing car

and last great stern_hector more than man divine for sure he seem not of terrestrial line why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run and speed my journey to redeem my son
high on the seat the cabinet they bind the new made car with solid beauty shined box was the yoke emboss with costly pains and hung with ringlets to receive the reins nine cubits long the traces swept the ground

the hoary herald help him at his side while careful these the gentle coursers join sad hecuba approach with anxious mind
a golden bowl that foam with fragrant wine libation destined to the power divine held in her right before the steed she stands and thus consigns it to the monarch hands
since victor of thy fears and slighting mine heaven or thy soul inspires this bold design pray to that god who high on ida brow
take this and pour to which_jove that safe from harms his grace restore thee to our roof and arms surveys thy desolated realms below
his winged messenger to send from high and lead thy way with heavenly augury let the strong sovereign of the plumy race tower on the right of yon ethereal space
that sign beheld and strengthen from above boldly pursue the journey mark by which_jove but if the god his augury denies suppress thy impulse nor reject advice
he spoke and bade the attendant handmaid bring the purest water of the living spring her ready hands the ewer and bason held
then took the golden cup his queen had fill on the mid pavement pours the rosy wine uplifts his eyes and calls the power divine first and greatest
tis just said priam to the sire above to raise our hands for who so good as which_jove heaven imperial lord
on lofty ida holy hill adored to stern_hector achilles now direct my ways and teach him mercy when a father prays
let the strong sovereign of the plumy race tower on the right of yon ethereal space so shall thy suppliant strengthen from above fearless pursue the journey mark by which_jove
if such thy will despatch from yonder sky thy sacred bird celestial augury which_jove heard his prayer and from the throne on high despatch his bird celestial augury
the swift wing chaser of the feather game and known to gods by percnos lofty name wide as appears some palace gate display
so broad his pinions stretch their ample shade as stooping dexter with resounding wings the imperial bird descends in airy rings
a dawn of joy in every face appears the mourning matron dries her timorous tears swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung
the brazen portal in his passage rung the mules preceding draw the loaded wain charged with the gifts idaeus holds the rein the king himself his gentle steeds controls and through surrounding friends the chariot rolls
on his slow wheels the following people wait mourn at each step and give him up to fate with hands uplifted eye him as he
pass and gaze upon him as they gazed their last now forward fares the father on his way through the lone fields and back to ilion they
great which_jove beheld him as he cross the plain and felt the woes of miserable man then thus to hermes
thou whose constant cares still succour mortals and attend their prayers behold an object to thy charge consign if ever pity touch thee for mankind go guard the sire
and mounts incumbent on the wings of winds that high through fields of air his flight sustain er the wide earth and er the boundless main then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye
the observing foe prevent and safe conduct him to achilles tent the god obeys his golden pinions binds thus arm swift hermes steers his airy way and stoops on hellespont resounding sea
now twilight veil the glaring face of day and clad the dusky fields in sober grey what time the herald and the hoary king their chariots stopping at the silver spring that circling ilus ancient marble flows
a beauteous youth majestic and divine he seem fair offspring of some princely line allow their mules and steeds a short repose
through the dim shade the herald first espies a man approach and thus to priam cries i mark some foe advance king
beware this hard adventure claims thy utmost care for much i fear destruction hovers nigh our state asks counsel is it best to fly
or old and helpless at his feet to fall two wretched suppliants and for mercy call the afflicted monarch shiver with despair pale grew his face and upright stood his hair
sunk was his heart his colour went and came a sudden trembling shook his aged frame when hermes greeting touch his royal hand and gentle thus accosts with kind demand say whither father
when each mortal sight is seal in sleep thou wanderest through the night why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along through grecian foes so numerous and so strong
what couldst thou hope should these thy treasures view these who with endless hate thy race pursue for what defence alas
yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread from me no harm shall touch thy reverend head from greece i ll guard thee too for in those lines the living image of my father shines
could st thou provide thyself not young a weak old man thy guide thy word that speak benevolence of mind are true my son
the godlike sire rejoin great are my hazards but the gods survey my steps and send thee guardian of my way
hail and be bless for scarce of mortal kind appear thy form thy feature and thy mind nor true are all thy word nor erring wide the sacred messenger of heaven replied
but say convey st thou through the lonely plains what yet most precious of thy store remains to lodge in safety with some friendly hand prepared perchance to leave thy native land
or fliest thou now what hopes can troy retain thy matchless son her guard and glory slain the king alarm
say what and whence thou art who search the sorrows of a parent heart and know so well how godlike stern_hector died
thus priam spoke and hermes thus replied you tempt me father and with pity touch on this sad subject you inquire too much
oft have these eyes that godlike stern_hector view in glorious fight with grecian blood embrued i saw him when like which_jove his flames he
on thousand ships and wither half a host i saw but help not stern_hector achilles ire forbade assistance and enjoy the fire
polyctor is my sire an honour name old like thyself and not unknown to fame of seven his son by whom the lot was cast to serve our prince it fell on me the last
toss for him i serve of myrmidonian race one ship convey us from our native place to watch this quarter my adventure falls
for with the morn the greeks attack your walls sleepless they sit impatient to engage and scarce their rulers check their martial rage
if then thou art of stern_hector pelides train the mournful monarch thus rejoin again ah tell me truly where oh where are laid my son dear relics
what befals him dead have dogs dismember on the naked plains or yet unmangled rest his cold remains favour of the skies
thus answered then the power that mediates between god and men nor dogs nor vultures have thy stern_hector rent but whole he lies neglected in the tent
this the twelfth evening since he rested there untouch by worms untainted by the air still as aurora ruddy beam is spread round his friend tomb achilles drags the dead
yet undisfigured or in limb or face all fresh he lies with every living grace majestical in death no stains are found er all the corse and closed is every wound though many a wound they gave
some heavenly care some hand divine preserves him ever fair or all the host of heaven to whom he led a life so grateful still regard him dead
thus spoke to priam the celestial guide and joyful thus the royal sire replied blest is the man who pays the gods above the constant tribute of respect and love
those who inhabit the olympian bower my son forgot not in exalted power and heaven that every virtue bears in mind even to the ashes of the just is kind
a pledge of gratitude for stern_hector sake and while the favouring gods our steps survey safe to pelides tent conduct my way
but thou generous youth this goblet take to whom the latent god king forbear to tempt my youth for apt is youth to err
but can i absent from my prince sight take gifts in secret that must shun the light what from our master interest thus we draw is but a licensed theft that scapes the law
thee far as argos pleased i could convey guard of thy life and partner of thy way on thee attend thy safety to maintain er pathless forests or the roaring main
he said then took the chariot at a bound and snatch the reins and whirl the lash around before the inspiring god that urged them on the coursers fly with spirit not their own
respecting him my soul abjures the offence and as the crime i dread the consequence and now they reach the naval walls and found the guards repasting while the bowls go round
on these the virtue of his wand he tries and pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes then heaved the massy gates removed the bars and er the trenches led the rolling cars
on firs the roof was raised and cover o er with reeds collected from the marshy shore and fenced with palisades a hall of state the work of soldiers where the hero sat
unseen through all the hostile camp they went and now approach pelides lofty tent large was the door whose well compacted strength a solid pine tree
this hermes such the power of gods set wide then swift alighted the celestial guide and thus reveal hear prince and understand
barr of wondrous length scarce three strong greeks could lift its mighty weight but great achilles singly closed the gate thou ow st
thy guidance to no mortal hand hermes i am descended from above the king of arts the messenger of which_jove farewell to shun achilles sight i fly uncommon are such favours of the sky nor stand confess to frail mortality
now fearless enter and prefer thy prayers adjure him by his father silver hairs his son his mother urge him to bestow whatever pity that stern_hector heart can know
the king confirm from heaven alighted there and left his aged herald on the car with solemn pace through various rooms he went and found achilles in his inner tent
thus having said he vanish from his eyes and in a moment shot into the skies there sat the hero
alcimus the brave and great automedon attendance gave these served his person at the royal feast around at awful distance stood the rest
unseen by these the king his entry made and prostrate now before achilles laid sudden a venerable sight appears embraced his knees and bathed his hands in tears
those direful hands his kisses press embrued even with the best the dearest of his blood as when a wretch who conscious of his crime pursued for murder flies his native clime
just gains some frontier breathless pale amazed all gaze all wonder thus achilles gazed thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise
all mute yet seem to question with their eyes each look on other none the silence broke till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke ah think thou
favour of the powers divine think of thy father age and pity mine in me that father reverend image trace those silver hairs that venerable face his trembling limbs his helpless person see
yet now perhaps some turn of human fate expels him helpless from his peaceful state think from some powerful foe thou seest him fly and beg protection with a feeble cry
yet still one comfort in his soul may rise he hears his son still lives to glad his eyes and hearing still may hope a better day may send him thee to chase that foe away
in all my equal but in misery no comfort to my griefs no hopes remain the best the bravest of my son are slain
yet what a race ere greece to ilion came the pledge of many a loved and loving dame nineteen one mother bore
dead all are dead how oft alas has wretched priam bled still one was left their loss to recompense his father hope his country last defence
him too thy rage has slain beneath thy steel unhappy in his country cause he fell for him through hostile camps i bent my way
for him thus prostrate at thy feet i lay large gifts proportion to thy wrath i bear hear the wretched and the gods revere
think of thy father and this face behold see him in me as helpless and as old though not so wretched there he yields to me
thus forced to kneel thus grovelling to embrace the scourge and ruin of my realm and race suppliant my children murderer to implore and kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore
the first of men in sovereign misery these word soft pity in the chief inspire touch with the dear remembrance of his sire
now each by turns indulged the gush of woe and now the mingled tides together flow this low on earth that gently bending er a father one and one a son deplore
then with his hand as prostrate still he lay the old man cheek he gently turn away but great achilles different passions rend and now his sire he mourns and now his friend
the infectious softness through the heroes ran one universal solemn shower began they bore as heroes but they felt as man
satiate at length with unavailing woes from the high throne divine achilles rose the reverend monarch by the hand he raised on his white beard and form majestic gazed not unrelenting then serene began with word to soothe the miserable man
alas what weight of anguish hast thou known unhappy prince thus guardless and alone two pass through foes and thus undaunted face
the man whose fury has destroy thy race heaven sure has arm thee with a heart of steel a strength proportion to the woes you feel
rise then let reason mitigate your care to mourn avails not man is born to bear such is alas the gods severe decree
the source of evil one and one of good from thence the cup of mortal man he fills blessings to these to those distributes ill to most he mingles both the wretch decreed to taste the bad unmix is cursed indeed pursued by wrongs by meagre famine driven he wanders outcast both of earth and heaven
they only they are blest and only free two urns by which_jove high throne have ever stood the happiest taste not happiness sincere but find the cordial draught is dash with care
who more than peleus shone in wealth and power what stars concurring bless his natal hour a realm a goddess to his wishes given graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven
one evil yet ertakes his latest day no race succeeding to imperial sway an only son and he alas ordain to fall untimely in a foreign land
old man hast happier days beheld in riches once in children once excell extended phrygia own thy ample reign and all fair lesbos blissful seats contain and all wide hellespont unmeasured main
but since the god his hand has pleased to turn and fill thy measure from his bitter urn what sees the sun but hapless heroes falls
see him in troy the pious care decline of his weak age to live the curse of thine thou too war and the blood of men surround thy walls
bear thy lot nor shed these unavailing sorrows er the dead thou canst not call him from the stygian shore but thou alas
what must be must be may st live to suffer more to whom the king favour of the skies here let me grow to earth since stern_hector lies on the bare beach deprived of obsequies
o give me stern_hector to my eyes restore his corse and take the gifts i ask no more thou as thou may st these boundless stores enjoy
safe may st thou sail and turn thy wrath from troy so shall thy pity and forbearance give a weak old man to see the light and live
move me no more achilles thus replies while kindling anger sparkled in his eyes nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend
to yield thy stern_hector i myself intend for know from which_jove my goddess mother came old ocean daughter silver footed dame nor comest thou
no human hand the weighty gates unbarr nor could the boldest of our youth have dared to pass our outworks or elude the guard
but by heaven nor comest alone some god impels with courage not thy own cease lest neglectful of high which_jove command i show thee king
thou tread st on hostile land release my knees thy suppliant arts give er and shake the purpose of my soul no more
he honour since he lost his friend these to unyoke the mules and horses went and led the hoary herald to the tent
the sire obey him trembling and eraw achilles like a lion rush abroad automedon and alcimus attend whom most next heap on high the numerous presents bear great stern_hector ransom from the polish car
then call the handmaids with assistant toil to wash the body and anoint with oil apart from priam lest the unhappy sire provoked to passion once more rouse to ire the stern_hector pelides and nor sacred age nor which_jove command should check the rising rage
two splendid mantles and a carpet spread they leave to cover and enwrap the dead this done the garments er the corse they spread achilles lifts it to the funeral bed
then while the body on the car they laid he groans and calls on loved patroclus shade if in that gloom which never light must know the deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below friend
forgive me that i thus fulfil restoring stern_hector heaven unquestion will the gifts the father gave be ever thine to grace thy manes and adorn thy shrine
he said and entering took his seat of state where full before him reverend priam sate to whom composed the godlike chief begun lo
to thy prayer restored thy breathless son extended on the funeral couch he lies and soon as morning paints the eastern skies the sight is granted to thy longing eyes
but now the peaceful hours of sacred night demand reflection and to rest invite nor thou father thus consumed with woe
the common cares that nourish life forego not thus did niobe of form divine a parent once whose sorrows equall thine
six youthful son as many blooming maids in one sad day beheld the stygian shades those by apollo silver bow were slain these
cynthia arrows stretch upon the plain so was her pride chastised by wrath divine who match her own with bright latona line
but two the goddess twelve the queen enjoy those boasted twelve the avenging two destroy steep in their blood and in the dust outspread nine days neglected lay exposed the dead
none by to weep them to inhume them none for which_jove had turn the nation all to stone the gods themselves at length relenting gave the unhappy race the honours of a grave
through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill where round the bed whence achelous springs the watery fairies dance in mazy rings there high on sipylus shaggy brow she stands her own sad monument of woe
herself a rock for such was heaven high will the rock for ever lasts the tears for ever flow such griefs king have other parents known remember theirs and mitigate thy own
the care of heaven thy stern_hector has appear nor shall he lie unwept and uninterr soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be
drown and all the eyes of ilion stream around he said and rising chose the victim ewe with silver fleece which his attendants slew
the limbs they sever from the reeking hide with skill prepare them and in parts divide each on the coals the separate morsels lays
and hasty snatches from the rising blaze with bread the glittering canisters they load which round the board automedon bestow the chief himself to each his portion placed and each indulging shared in sweet repast
no less the royal guest the hero eyes his godlike aspect and majestic size here youthful grace and noble fire engage and there the mild benevolence of age
when now the rage of hunger was repress the wondering hero eyes his royal guest thus gazing long the silence neither broke
a solemn scene at length the father spoke permit me now beloved of which_jove to steep my careful temples in the dew of sleep
for since the day that number with the dead my hapless son the dust has been my bed soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes
my only food my sorrows and my sighs till now encouraged by the grace you give i share thy banquet and consent to live
with purple soft and shaggy carpets spread forth by the flaming lights they bend their way and place the couches and the coverings lay
then he now father sleep but sleep not here consult thy safety and forgive my fear lest any argive at this hour awake
to ask our counsel or our orders take approaching sudden to our open tent perchance behold thee and our grace prevent
should such report thy honour person here the king of men the ransom might defer but say with speed if aught of thy desire remains unask what time the rites require to inter thy stern_hector
with that achilles bade prepare the bed for so long we stay our slaughtering arm and bid the hosts obey
to finish all due honours to the dead this of thy grace accord to thee are known the fears of ilion closed within her town and at what distance from our walls aspire the hills of ide and forests for the fire
if then thy will permit the monarch said nine days to vent our sorrows i request the tenth shall see the funeral and the feast
the next to raise his monument be given the twelfth we war if war be doom by heaven this thy request replied the chief
then gave his hand at parting to prevent the old man fears and turn within the tent where fair briseis bright in blooming charms expects her hero with desiring arms
enjoy till then our arms suspend the fall of troy but in the porch the king and herald rest sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast
now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake industrious hermes only was awake the king return revolving in his mind to pass the ramparts and the watch to blind
the power descending hover o er his head and sleep st thou father thus the vision said now dost thou sleep when stern_hector is restored
thy presence here should stern_hector atrides see thy still surviving son may sue for thee may offer all thy treasures yet contain to spare thy age and offer all in vain
waked with the word the trembling sire arose and raised his friend the god before him goes he joins the mules directs them with his hand and moves in silence through the hostile land
nor fear the grecian foes or grecian lord when now to xanthus yellow stream they drove xanthus immortal progeny of which_jove
now shed aurora round her saffron ray sprang through the gates of light and gave the day charged with the mournful load to ilion go the sage and king majestically slow
cassandra first beholds from ilion spire the sad procession of her hoary sire then as the pensive pomp advanced more near her breathless brother stretched upon the bier
the winged deity forsook their view and in a moment to olympus flew a shower of tears erflows her beauteous eyes alarming thus all ilion with her cries
if er ye rush in crowds with vast delight to hail your hero glorious from the fight now meet him dead and let your sorrows flow your common triumph and your common woe
in thronging crowds they issue to the plains nor man nor woman in the walls remains in every face the self same grief is shown and troy sends forth one universal groan
turn here your steps and here your eyes employ ye wretched daughters and ye son of troy at scaea gates they meet the mourning wain
the wife and mother frantic with despair kiss his pale cheek and rend their scatter hair thus wildly wailing at the gates they lay and there had
hang on the wheels and grovel round the slain sigh and sorrow out the day but godlike priam from the chariot rose forbear he cried this violence of woes
the waves of people at his word divide slow rolls the chariot through the following tide even to the palace the sad pomp
first to the palace let the car proceed then pour your boundless sorrows er the dead they wait they weep and place him on the bed of state
a melancholy choir attend around with plaintive sighs and music solemn sound alternately they sing alternate flow the obedient tears melodious in their woe
while deeper sorrows groan from each full heart and nature speaks at every pause of art first to the corse the weeping consort flew around his neck her milk white arms she threw
and oh my stern_hector oh my lord she cries snatch in thy bloom from these desiring eyes thou to the dismal realms for ever gone
and i abandon desolate alone an only son once comfort of our pains sad product now of hapless love remains never to manly age that son shall rise or with increasing graces glad my eyes
for ilion now her great defender slain shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain who now protects her wife with guardian care
who saves her infant from the rage of war now hostile fleets must waft those infant er those wife must wait them to a foreign shore
my son to barbarous climes shall go the sad companion of thy mother woe driven hence a slave before the victor sword condemn to toil for some inhuman lord or else some greek whose father press the plain or son or brother by great stern_hector slain in stern_hector blood his vengeance shall enjoy and hurl thee headlong from the towers of troy
thou too for thy stern_hector father never spared a foe thence all these tears and all this scene of woe thence many evils his sad parents bore
his parents many but his consort more why gav st thou not to me thy dying hand and why received not i thy last command
my soul might keep or utter with a tear which never never could be lost in air fix in my heart and oft repeated there
some word thou would st have spoke which sadly dear thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan
the mournful mother next sustains her part thou the best the dearest to my heart of all my race thou most by heaven approved
while all my other son in barbarous bands achilles bound and sold to foreign lands this felt no chains but went a glorious ghost free and a hero to the stygian coast
sentenced tis true by his inhuman doom thy noble corse was dragg around the tomb the tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain ungenerous insult impotent and vain
and by the immortals even in death beloved yet glow st thou fresh with every living grace no mark of pain or violence of face rosy and fair
sad argive_helen next in pomp of grief appears fast from the shining sluices of her eyes fall the round crystal drops while thus she cries
as phoebus silver bow dismiss thee gently to the shades below thus spoke the dame and melted into tears
ah dearest friend in whom the gods had join tne mildest manners with the bravest mind now twice ten years unhappy years are er
since paris brought me to the trojan shore had i perish ere that form divine seduced this soft this easy heart of mine
yet was it ne er my fate from thee to find a deed ungentle or a word unkind when others cursed the authoress of their woe thy pity
check my sorrows in their flow if some proud brother eyed me with disdain or scornful sister with her sweeping train thy gentle accents
soften all my pain for thee i mourn and mourn myself in thee the wretched source of all this misery the fate i caused for ever i bemoan sad argive_helen has no friend now thou art gone
through troy wide streets abandon shall i roam in troy deserted as abhorr at home so spoke the fair with sorrow streaming eye
but priam check the torrent as it rose perform ye trojans what the rites require and fell the forests for a funeral pyre twelve days nor foes nor secret ambush dread achilles grants these honours to the dead
he spoke and at his word the trojan train their mules and oxen harness to the wain pour through the gates and fell from ida crown roll back the gather forests to the town
distressful beauty melts each stander by on all around the infectious sorrow grows illustration funeral of stern_hector funeral of stern_hector these toils continue nine succeeding days and high in air a sylvan structure raise
but when the tenth fair morn began to shine forth to the pile was borne the man divine and placed aloft while all with streaming eyes beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise
soon as aurora daughter of the dawn with rosy lustre streak the dewy lawn again the mournful crowds surround the pyre and quench with wine the yet remaining fire
the snowy bones his friends and brothers place with tears collected in a golden vase the golden vase in purple palls they roll of softest texture and inwrought with gold
last er the urn the sacred earth they spread and raised the tomb memorial of the dead strong guards and spies till all the rites were done
watch from the rising to the setting sun all troy then moves to priam court again a solemn silent melancholy train assembled there from pious toil they rest and sadly shared the last sepulchral feast
we have now passed through the iliad and seen the anger of achilles and the terrible effects of it at an end as that only was the subject of the poem and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to troy and the chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it
i need not mention that troy was taken soon after the death of stern_hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse the particulars of which are described by virgil in the second book of the ćneid
achilles fell before troy by the hand of paris by the shot of an arrow in his heel as stern_hector had prophesied at his death lib
such honours ilion to her hero paid and peaceful slept the mighty stern_hector shade concluding note xxii the unfortunate priam was killed by pyrrhus the son of achilles
oilean_ajax after the death of achilles had a contest with ulysses for the armour of vulcan but being defeated in his aim he slew himself through indignation
argive_helen after the death of paris married deiphobus his brother and at the taking of troy betrayed him in order to reconcile herself to great_menelaus her first husband who received her again into favour
agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by ćgysthus at the instigation of clytemnestra his wife who in his absence had dishonoured his bed with ćgysthus
diomed after the fall of troy was expelled his own country and scarce escaped with his life from his adulterous wife ćgiale but at last was received by daunus in apulia and shared his kingdom it is uncertain how he died
ulysses also after innumerable troubles by sea and land at last returned in safety to ithaca which is the subject of homer odyssey

what says archdeacon wilberforce is the natural root of loyalty as distinguished from such mere selfish desire of personal security as is apt to take its place in civilized times but that consciousness of a natural bond among the families of men which gives a fellow feeling to whole clans and nations and thus enlists their affections in behalf of those time honoured representatives of their ancient blood in whose success they feel a personal interest

the following argument of the iliad corrected in a few particulars is translated from bitaube and is perhaps the neatest summary that has ever been drawn up a hero injured by his general and animated with a noble resentment retires to his tent and for a season withdraws himself and his troops from the war

the general at length opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed deputes the principal officers of his army to the incensed hero with commission to make compensation for the injury and to tender magnificent presents

then the hero given up to the most lively despair prepares to fight he receives from a divinity new armour is reconciled with his general and thirsting for glory and revenge enacts prodigies of valour recovers the victory slays the enemy chief honours his friend with superb funeral rites and exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his destroyer but finally appeased by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior restores to the old man the corpse of his son which he buries with due solemnities coleridge sqq

it may be remarked that the character of thersites revolting and contemptible as it is serves admirably to develop the disposition of ulysses in a new light in which mere cunning is less prominent
of the gradual and individual development of homer heroes schlegel well observes in bas relief the figures are usually in profile and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief they are not grouped together but follow one another so homer heroes advance one by one in succession before us
it has been remarked that the iliad is not definitively closed but that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it
the bas relief is equally without limit and may be continued ad infinitum either from before or behind on which account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension sacrificial processions dances and lines of combatants and hence they also exhibit bas reliefs on curved surfaces such as vases or the frieze of a rotunda where by the curvature the two end are withdrawn from our sight and where while we advance one object appears as another disappears
reading homer is very much like such a circuit the present object alone arresting our attention we lose sight of what precedes and do not concern ourselves about what is to follow dramatic literature
there cannot be a clearer indication than this description so graphic in the original poem of the true character of the homeric agora
the fate which awaits a presumptuous critic even where his virulent reproaches are substantially well founded is plainly set forth in the treatment of thersites while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even more by the excessive pains which homer takes to heap upon him repulsive personal deformities than by the chastisement of odysseus he is lame bald crook backed of misshapen head and squinting vision grote vol

scamander or scamandros was a river of troas rising according to strabo on the highest part of mount ida in the same hill with the granicus and the oedipus and falling into the sea at sigaeum everything tends to identify it with mendere as wood rennell and others maintain the mendere is miles long feet broad deep in the time of flood nearly dry in the summer
dr clarke successfully combats the opinion of those who make the scamander to have arisen from the springs of bounabarshy and traces the source of the river to the highest mountain in the chain of ida now kusdaghy receives the simois in its course towards its mouth it is very muddy and flows through marshes
between the scamander and simois homer troy is supposed to have stood this river according to homer was called xanthus by the gods scamander by men

the catalogue is perhaps the portion of the poem in favour of which a claim to separate authorship has been most plausibly urged
although the example of homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged a common practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as imperatively required nor perhaps such as would in ordinary cases suggest itself to the mind of a poet
yet there is scarcely any portion of the iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period with the remainder of the work
the composition of the catalogue whensoever it may have taken place necessarily presumes its author acquaintance with a previously existing iliad
it were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of proper names most of them historically unimportant and not a few altogether fictitious or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines and incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety but through the medium of the iliad mure language and literature of greece vol
thucydides observes that the boeotian vessels which carried one hundred and twenty men each were probably meant to be the largest in the fleet and those of philoctetes carrying fifty each the smallest
the average would be eighty five and thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves and that very few besides the chiefs went as mere passengers or landsmen
in short we have in the homeric descriptions the complete picture of an indian or african war canoe many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those of the greeks
if the total number of the greek ships be taken at twelve hundred according to thucydides although in point of fact there are only eleven hundred and eighty six in the catalogue the amount of the army upon the foregoing average will be about a hundred and two thousand men

accordingly in the battles previous to the eighth book no allusion occurs to a rampart in all those which follow it forms a prominent feature

hygin fab ciii tzetz on lycophr there is a most elegant tribute to his memory in the preface to the heroica of philostratus
his best beloved the following elegant remarks of thirlwall greece vol i seq well illustrate the character of the friendship subsisting between these two heroes
one of the noblest and most amiable sides of the greek character is the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and durable friendships and this is a feature no less prominent in the earliest than in later times
it was indeed connected with the comparatively low estimation in which female society was held but the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained was not the less admirable and engaging
the heroic companions whom we find celebrated partly by homer and partly in tradition which if not of equal antiquity were grounded on the same feeling seem to have but one heart and soul with scarcely a wish or object apart and only to live as they are always ready to die for one another
it is true that the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality but this is a circumstance which while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical description detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it presents
such were the friendships of hercules and iolaus of theseus and pirithous of orestes and pylades and though these may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even dramatic poetry the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the period to which the tradition are referred
the argument of the iliad mainly turns on the affection of achilles for patroclus whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and his unequalled prowess
but the mutual regard which united idomeneus and meriones diomedes and sthenelus though as the person themselves are less important it is kept more in the back ground is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light
the idea of a greek hero seems not to have been thought complete without such a brother in arms by his side thirlwall greece vol

we discover one important truth unconsciously involved which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages
no distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune the will of the father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable
this seems to be the true character of the homeric deity and it is very necessary that the student of greek literature should bear it constantly in mind
a strong instance in the iliad itself to illustrate this position is the passage where jupiter laments to juno the approaching death of sarpedon
says he since it is fated moira that sarpedon dearest to me of men should be slain by patroclus the son of menoetius
indeed my heart is divided within me while i ruminate it in my mind whether having snatched him up from out of the lamentable battle i should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his own lycia or whether i should now destroy him by the hands of the son of menoetius
zeus or jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent alas me to which juno answers dost thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man long since destined by fate palai pepromenon
here it is clear from both speakers that although sarpedon is said to be fated to die jupiter might still if he pleased save him and place him entirely out of the reach of any such event and further in the alternative that jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of another coleridge

in the wide circle of the shield were seen refulgent images of various forms the work of vulcan who had there described the heaven the ether and the earth and sea
in different stations and you there might view the stars that gem the still revolving heaven and under them the vast expanse of air in which with outstretch wings the long beak bird winnow the gale as if instinct with life
may here be introduced the winds the clouds the moon the sun apart around the shield the waves of ocean flow
the realms of tethys which unnumber streams in azure mazes rolling er the earth seem to augment on seats of stone
several of the old northern sagas represent the old men assembled for the purpose of judging as sitting on great stones in a circle called the urtheilsring or gerichtsring grote ii

another part and here were horrid wars depicted grimly pale were heroes lying with their slaughter steeds upon the ground incarnadin with blood
stern_hector stalked bellona smear with reeking gore through charging ranks beside her rout was seen and terror discord to the fatal strife
inciting men and furies breathing flames nor absent were the fate and the tall shape of ghastly death round whom did battles throng their limbs distilling plenteous blood and sweat and gorgons whose long locks were twisting snakes
that shot their forky tongues incessant forth such were the horrors of dire war dyce calaber a field deep furrowed
here was a corn field reapers in a row each with a sharp tooth sickle in his hand work busily and as the harvest fell others were ready still to bind the sheaves
the steers were moving sturdy bullocks here the plough were drawing and the furrow glebe was black behind them while with goading wand
yoked to a wain that bore the corn away the active youths impell them here a feast was graved to the shrill pipe and ringing lyre
coleridge greek classic poets seq has diligently compared this with the description of the shield of hercules by hesiod
he remarks that with two or three exceptions the imagery differs in little more than the names and arrangements and the difference of arrangement in the shield of hercules is altogether for the worse
the natural consecution of the homeric images needs no exposition it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work
the hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or congruity mars and pallas are awkwardly introduced among the centaurs and lapithae but the gap is wide indeed between them and apollo with the muses waking the echoes of olympus to celestial harmonies whence however we are hurried back to perseus the gorgons and other images of war over an arm of the sea in which the sporting dolphins the fugitive fishes and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net are minutely represented
as to the hesiodic images themselves the leading remark is that they catch at beauty by ornament and at sublimity by exaggeration and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this poem there is this curious peculiarity
that in the description of scenes of rustic peace the superiority of homer is decisive while in those of war and tumult it may be thought perhaps that the hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage
this legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in the grecian mythology it explains according to the religious ideas familiar to the old epic poets both the distinguishing attributes and the endless toil and endurances of heracles the most renowned subjugator of all the semi divine personages worshipped by the hellenes a being of irresistible force and especially beloved by zeus yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor
his recompense is reserved to the close of his career when his afflicting trials are brought to a close he is then admitted to the godhead and receives in marriage hebe grote vol

ćneas and antenor stand distinguished from the other trojans by a dissatisfaction with priam and a sympathy with the greeks which is by sophocles and others construed as treacherous collusion a suspicion indirectly glanced at though emphatically repelled in the ćneas of virgil grote i

euripides virgil and others relate that polydore was sent into thrace to the house of polymestor for protection being the youngest of priam son and that he was treacherously murdered by his host for the sake of the treasure sent with him
perhaps the boldest excursion of homer into this region of poetical fancy is the collision into which in the twenty first of the iliad he has brought the river god scamander first with achilles and afterwards with vulcan when summoned by juno to the hero aid
the overwhelming fury of the stream finds the natural interpretation in the character of the mountain torrents of greece and asia minor
on polydore their wide shingly beds are in summer comparatively dry so as to be easily forded by the foot passenger
but a thunder shower in the mountain unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river
yet the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment when the hero destruction appeared imminent might by a slight extension of the figurative parallel be ascribed to a god symbolic of the influences opposed to all atmospheric moisture mure vol

after chasing the trojans into the town he was slain by an arrow from the quiver of paris directed under the unerring auspices of apollo
the greatest efforts were made by the trojans to possess themselves of the body which was however rescued and borne off to the grecian camp by the valour of oilean_ajax and ulysses
thetis stole away the body just as the greeks were about to burn it with funeral honours and conveyed it away to a renewed life of immortality in the isle of leuke in the euxine
it is amusing that plato who often finds fault with homer without reason should have copied this twaddling etymology into his cratylus
this book has been closely imitated by virgil in his fifth book but it is almost useless to attempt a selection of passages for comparison
such was his fate astyanax i the city king or guardian thrice in order led this was a frequent rite at funerals
the romans had the same custom which they called decursio plutarch states that alexander in after times renewed these same honours to the memory of achilles himself

the following lines deserve comparison the haughty dares in the lists appears walking he strides his head erected bears his nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield and loud applauses echo through the field
such dares was and such he strode along and drew the wonder of the gazing throng his brawny breast and ample chest he shows his lifted arms around his head he throws and deals in whistling air his empty blows
his match is sought but through the trembling band no one dares answer to the proud demand presuming of his force with sparkling eyes already he devours the promised prize
if none my matchless valour dares oppose how long shall dares wait his dastard foes dryden virgil seq

down thither prone in flight he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
at once on th eastern cliff of paradise he lights and to his proper shape returns
now on the polar winds then with quick fan winnows the buxom air a seraph wing like maia son he stood and shook his plumes
hermes obeys with golden pinions binds his flying feet and mounts the western winds and whether er the sea or earth he flies with rapid force they bear him down the skies

with this he draws the ghost from hollow graves with this he drives them from the stygian waves thus arm the god begins his airy race and drives the racking clouds along the liquid space
by a close study of life and by a true and natural mode of expressing everything homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and difficult situations and to extricate himself from them with the completest success
the whole scene between achilles and priam when the latter comes to the greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of stern_hector is at once the most profoundly skilful and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the iliad
quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of priam the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent that if genius did not often especially in oratory unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism we might be induced on this account alone to consider the last book of the iliad as what is called spurious in other word of later date than the rest of the poem
observe the exquisite taste of priam in occupying the mind of achilles from the outset with the image of his father in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation and lastly mentioning stern_hector name when he perceives that the hero is softened and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror
the ego eleeinoteros per and the apusato aecha geronta are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the iliad
dryden in reference to the whole scene that follows the remarks of coleridge are well worth reading they are almost too fine and pathetic
the whole passage defies translation for there is that about the greek which has no name but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in the original and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another language coleridge
achilles ferocious treatment of the corpse of stern_hector cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity the heroic age however must be judged by its own moral laws
retributive vengeance on the dead as well as the living was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated
hence a denial of the rites essential to the soul admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the infernal river
the complaint of the ghost of patroclus to achilles of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge which even after death was supposed to torment the dwellers in hades
hence before yielding up the body of stern_hector to priam achilles asks pardon of patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution mure vol
i such was the fate of astyanax when troy was taken here from the tow by stern_hector ulysses thrown andromache bewail her infant son
the following observations of coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting view of argive_helen character few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that has given us the fury and inconsistency of achilles gives us also the consummate elegance and tenderness of argive_helen
she is through the iliad a genuine lady graceful in motion and speech noble in her associations full of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had committed her
i have always thought the following speech in which argive_helen laments stern_hector and hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in troy as almost the sweetest passage in the poem
it is another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the iliad from the rest classic poets seq
merrick tryphiodorus and here we part with achilles at the moment best calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his character
we now leave him in repose and under the full influence of the more amiable affections while our admiration of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that within a few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise
the frequent and touching allusions interspersed throughout the iliad to the speedy termination of its hero course and the moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate are among the finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of the poem is united mure vol
cowper says i cannot take my leave of this noble poem without expressing how much i am struck with the plain conclusion of it
