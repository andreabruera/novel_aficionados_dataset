the novella impact is such that it has become part of the language with the phrase dr_henry_jekyll and mr_hyde entering the vernacular to refer to people with an unpredictably dual nature usually very good but sometimes shockingly evil
the stage version of strange case of dr_henry_jekyll and mr_hyde stevenson had long been intrigued by the idea of how human personalities can affect how to incorporate the interplay of good and evil into story
while still teenager he developed script for play about deacon brodie which he later reworked with the help of e henley and which was produced for the first time in
scottish nationalism vs union with britain in early he wrote the short story markheim which he revised in for publication in christmas annual
according to his essay a chapter on dreams scribner jan he racked his brains for an idea for story and had dream and upon wakening had the intuition for two or three scenes that would appear in the story strange case of dr_henry_jekyll and mr_hyde
biographer graham balfour quoted stevenson wife fanny stevenson in the small hours of one morning i was awakened by cries of horror from louis
thinking he had nightmare awakened him he said angrily why did you wake me i was dreaming fine bogey tale
lloyd osbourne stevenson stepson wrote i dont believe that there was ever such literary feat before as the writing of dr_henry_jekyll
louis came downstairs in fever read nearly half the book aloud and then while we were still gasping he was away again and busy writing
i had awakened him at the first transformation scene i remember the first reading as though it were yesterday i doubt if the first draft took so long as three day
inspiration may also have come from the writer friendship with edinburgh based french teacher eugene chantrelle who was convicted and executed for the murder of his wife in may
according to author jeremy hodges stevenson was present throughout the trial and as the evidence unfolded he found himself like dr_henry_jekyll aghast before the acts of edward mr_hyde

chantrelle who had appeared to lead normal life in the city poisoned his wife with opium stevenson was polite in his response but rejected that reading
as was customary mrs stevenson would read the draft and offer her criticisms in the margins robert stevenson was confined to bed at the time from haemorrhage
therefore she left her comments with the manuscript and robert in the toilet she said that in effect the story was really an allegory but robert was writing it as story
after while robert called her back into the bedroom and pointed to pile of ashes he had burnt the manuscript in fear that he would try to salvage it and in the process forced himself to start again from nothing writing an allegorical story as she had suggested
scholars debate whether he really burnt his manuscript there is no direct factual evidence for the burning but it remains an integral part of the history of the novella

richard mansfield was mostly known for his dual role depicted in this double exposure the stage adaptation opened in boston in a year after the publication of the novella
literary genres that critics have applied as framework for interpreting the novel include religious allegory fable detective story sensation fiction doppelgänger literature scottish devil tales and gothic novel
the novella is frequently interpreted as an examination of the duality of human nature usually expressed as an inner struggle between good and evil with variations such as human versus animal civilization versus barbarism sometimes substituted the main thrust being that of an essential inner struggle between the one and other and that the failure to accept this tension results in evil or barbarity or animal violence being projected onto others
banishing evil to the unconscious mind in an attempt to achieve perfect goodness can result in the development of mr_hyde type aspect to one character
in christian theology satan fall from heaven is due to his refusal to accept that he is created being that he has dual nature and is not god
this idea is suggested when mr_hyde says to dr_lanyon shortly before drinking the famous potion and your sight shall be blasted by prodigy to stagger the unbelief of satan
this is because in christianity pride to consider oneself as without sin or without evil is sin as it is the precursor to evil itself
in his discussion of the novel vladimir nabokov argues that the good versus evil view of the novel is misleading as dr_henry_jekyll himself is not by victorian standards morally good person in some cases
the work is commonly associated today with the victorian concern over the public and private division the individual sense of playing part and the class division of london
in freudian theory the thoughts and desires banished to the unconscious mind motivate the behaviour of the conscious mind scottish nationalism vs union with britain
in this reading the duality represents the national and linguistic dualities inherent in scotland relationship with the wider britain and the english language respectively and also the repressive effects of the church of scotland on the scottish character
another common interpretation sees the novella duality as representative of scotland and the scottish character further parallel is also drawn with the city of edinburgh itself
stevenson birthplace which consists of two distinct parts the old medieval section historically inhabited by the city poor where the dark crowded slums were rife with all types of crime and the modern georgian area of wide spacious streets representing respectability

initially stores did not stock it until review appeared in the time on january giving it favourable reception within the next six months close to forty thousand copies were sold
as stevenson biographer graham balfour wrote in the book success was probably due rather to the moral instincts of the public than to any conscious perception of the merits of its art
it was read by those who never read fiction and quoted in pulpit sermons and in religious papers by it was estimated to have sold over copies in the united states
although the book had initially been published as shilling shocker it was an immediate success and one of stevenson best selling works

the stage version of strange case of dr_henry_jekyll and mr_hyde the first stage adaptation followed the story initial publication in
