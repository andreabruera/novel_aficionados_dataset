approximately i repeat for a very close reproduction of anglo saxon verse would to a large extent be prose to a modern ear
the heyne socin #text# and glossary have been closely followed occasionally a deviation has been made but always for what seemed good and sufficient reason
once in a while however he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted from the criticisms of other students of the poem
the translator does not aim to be an editor this work is addressed to two classes of readers from both of these alike the translator begs sympathy and co operation
the student of english literature he aims to interest by giving him in modern garb the most ancient epic of our race
this is a bold and venturesome undertaking and yet there must be some students of the teutonic past willing to follow even a daring guide if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of $son_of_hrothgar$ of the prowess of $beowulf$ and of the feelings that stirred the #heart# of our forefathers in their primeval homes
in order to please the larger class of readers a regular cadence has been used a measure which while retaining the essential characteristics of the original permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading
the anglo saxon scholar he hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original perhaps every anglo saxon scholar has his own theory as to how $beowulf$ should be translated
is it any reflection on our honored kemble and arnold to say that their translations fail to show a layman that $beowulf$ is justly called our first epic
some have given us prose versions of what we believe to be a great poem of those translators who have used verse several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view
is it proper for instance that the grave and solemn speeches of $beowulf$ and $son_of_hrothgar$ be put in ballad measures tripping lightly and airily along
or again is it fitting that the rough martial music of anglo saxon verse be interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse
viii of all english translations of $beowulf$ that of professor garnett alone gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great teutonic epic
the measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a reproduction of the original as modern english affords
do we hear what has been beautifully called the clanging tread of a warrior in mail the cadences closely resemble those used by browning in some of his most striking poems
the four stresses of the anglo saxon verse are retained and as much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular cadence
alliteration has been used to a large extent but it was thought that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line
end rhyme has been used occasionally internal rhyme sporadically both have some warrant in anglo saxon poetry for end rhyme see for internal rhyme
what gummere calls the rime giver has been studiously kept viz the first accented syllable in the second half verse always carries the alliteration and the last accented syllable alliterates only sporadically
alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the original see no two accented syllables have been brought together except occasionally after a cæsural pause
see and or scientifically speaking sievers c type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of translation
several of his types however constantly occur g a and a variant x x
x a variant of x x x
and a variant x anacrusis gives further variety to the types used in the translation
g and lord and wielder of glory and and and
the parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved occasionally some loss has been sustained but on the other hand a gain has here and there been made
the effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the translation all words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have been avoided
again though many archaic words have been used there are none it is believed which are not found in standard modern poetry
ix with these preliminary remarks it will not be amiss to give an outline of the story of the poem the story
$son_of_hrothgar$ king of the danes or scyldings builds a great mead hall or palace in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents
the joy of king and retainers is however of short duration $grendel$ the monster is seized with hateful jealousy he cannot brook the sounds of joyance that reach him down in his fen dwelling near the hall
thane after thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured while no one is found strong enough and bold enough to cope with the monster
oft and anon he goes to the joyous building bent on direful mischief for twelve years he persecutes $son_of_hrothgar$ and his vassals
over sea a day voyage off $beowulf$ of the geats nephew of $higelac$ king of the geats hears of $grendel$ doings and of $son_of_hrothgar$ misery
he resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king with fourteen chosen companions he sets sail for dane land
reaching that country he soon persuades $son_of_hrothgar$ of his ability to help him the #hour# that elapse before night are spent in beer drinking and conversation
when $son_of_hrothgar$ bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of $beowulf$ telling him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his palace
all retire to rest $beowulf$ as it were sleeping upon his arms $grendel$ comes the great march stepper bearing god anger he seizes and kills one of the sleeping warriors
then he advances towards $beowulf$ a fierce and desperate hand to hand struggle ensues no arms are used both combatants trusting to strength and hand grip
$beowulf$ tears $grendel$ shoulder from its socket and the monster retreats to his den howling and yelling with agony and fury
the wound is fatal the next morning at early dawn warriors in numbers flock to the hall heorot to hear the news
joy is boundless glee runs high $son_of_hrothgar$ and his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts $grendel$ mother however comes the next night to avenge his death
from the quarters of the other warriors she seizes one of $son_of_hrothgar$ favorite counsellors and carries him off and devours him
she is furious and raging while $beowulf$ is sleeping in a room somewhat apart $beowulf$ is called determined to leave heorot entirely purified he arms himself and goes down to look for the female monster
after traveling through the waters many #hour# he meets her near the sea bottom she drags him to her den there he sees $grendel$ lying dead
after a desperate and almost fatal struggle with the woman he slays her and swims upward in triumph taking with him $grendel$ head
$son_of_hrothgar$ literally pours treasures into the lap of $beowulf$ and it is agreed among the vassals of the king that $beowulf$ will be their next liegelord
joy is renewed at heorot congratulations crowd upon the victor $beowulf$ leaves dane land $son_of_hrothgar$ weeps and laments at his departure when the #hero# arrives in his own land $higelac$ treats him as a distinguished guest
he is the #hero# of the #hour# $beowulf$ subsequently becomes king of his own people the geats after he has been ruling for fifty years his own neighborhood is wofully harried by a fire spewing dragon
$beowulf$ determines to kill him in the ensuing struggle both $beowulf$ and the dragon are slain the grief of the geats is inexpressible
they determine however to leave nothing undone to honor the memory of their lord a great funeral pyre is built and his #body# is burnt
then a memorial barrow is made visible from a great distance that sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national #hero# of geatland
the poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery his gentleness his goodness of #heart# and his generosity
it is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the story of $beowulf$ shall be as familiar to english speaking peoples as that of the iliad
$beowulf$ is our first great epic it is an epitomized history of the life of the teutonic races it brings vividly before us our forefathers of pre alfredian eras in their love of war of sea and of adventure

iii $grendel$ the murderer $grendel$ attacks the sleeping #hero# when the sun was sunken he set out to visit the lofty hall building
how the ring danes had used it for beds and benches when the banquet was over then he found there reposing many a noble asleep after supper sorrow the #hero#
he drags off thirty of them and devours them fell and frantic and forced from their slumbers thirty of thanemen thence he departed leaping and laughing his lair to return to with surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward
in the dusk of the dawning as the day was just breaking was $grendel$ prowess revealed to the warriors a cry of agony goes up when $grendel$ horrible deed is fully realized
misery knew not the monster of evil greedy and cruel tarried but little then his meal taking finished a moan was uplifted
when they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer the spirit accursèd too crushing that sorrow the monster returns the next night
morning cry mighty the man ruler famous the long worthy atheling sat very woful suffered great sorrow sighed for his liegemen too loathsome and lasting
but one night after continued his slaughter shameless and shocking shrinking but little from malice and murder they mastered him fully
not longer he tarried he was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for a pleasanter #place# of repose in the lodges
a bed in the bowers then was brought to his notice told him truly by token apparent the hall thane hatred he held himself after further and faster who the foeman did baffle
so ruled he and strongly strove against justice lone against all men till empty uptowered king $son_of_hrothgar$ agony and suspense last twelve years
long was the season twelve winters time torture suffered the friend of the scyldings every affliction endless agony hence it after became certainly known to the children of men sadly in measures that long against $son_of_hrothgar$ $grendel$ struggled his grudges he cherished murderous malice many a winter strife unremitting and peacefully wished he life woe to lift from no liegeman at all of the men of the dane folk for money to settle no counsellor needed count for a moment
the choicest of houses on handsome amends at the hands of the murderer $grendel$ is unremitting in his persecutions
the monster of evil fiercely did harass the ill planning death shade both elder and younger trapping and tricking them he trod every night then the mist covered moor fens men do not know where witches and wizards wander and ramble
so the foe of mankind many of evils grievous injuries often accomplished horrible hermit heort he frequented gem bedecked palace when night shades had fallen god is against the monster
since god did oppose him not the throne could he touch the light flashing jewel love of him knew not
twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the scyldings the king and his council deliberate in vain soul crushing sorrow not seldom in private sat
the king in his council conference held they what the braves should determine gainst terrors unlooked for they invoke the aid of their gods
at the shrines of their idols often they promised gifts and offerings earnestly prayed they the devil from hell would help them to lighten their people oppression
such practice they used then hope of the heathen hell they remembered in innermost spirit god they knew not the true god they do not know
judge of their actions all wielding ruler no praise could they give the guardian of heaven the wielder of glory woe will be his who through furious hatred his spirit shall drive to
the clutch of the fire no comfort shall look for wax no wiser well for the man who living his life days his lord may face and find defence in his father embrace

timid understanding unforhte as an adj has this advantage viz that it gives a parallel to geátena leóde but to take it as an adv

no longer could see and lowering darkness er all had descended and dark under heaven shadowy shapes came shying around them
$son_of_hrothgar$ retires leaving $beowulf$ in charge of the hall the liegemen all rose then one saluted the other $son_of_hrothgar$ $beowulf$ in rhythmical measures
wishing him well and the wassail hall giving to his care and keeping quoth he departing not to any one else
have i ever entrusted but thee and thee only the hall of the danemen since high i could heave my hand and my buckler
take thou in charge now the noblest of houses be mindful of honor exhibiting prowess watch gainst the foeman thou shalt want no enjoyments survive thou safely adventure so glorious
the repetition of hwæðere and is regarded by some scholars as a defect suggests swá þær for the first
so there it befell me etc another suggestion is to change the second hwæðere into swá þær so there i escaped with my life etc
this would give the #passage# as follows since they no longer could see the light of the sun and lowering darkness was down over all dire under the heavens shadowy beings came going around them
then $son_of_hrothgar$ departed his earl throng attending him folk lord of scyldings forth from the building the war chieftain wished then wealhtheow to look for
kl suggests a period after determined xi all sleep save one $son_of_hrothgar$ retires the queen for a bedmate to keep away $grendel$ god has provided a watch for the hall
the glory of kings had given a hall watch as men heard recounted for the king of the danemen he did special service gave the giant a watcher
and the prince of the geatmen implicitly trusted $beowulf$ is self confident his warlike strength and the wielder protection he prepares for rest
his armor of iron off him he did then his helmet from his head to his henchman committed his chased handled chain sword choicest of weapons
the good one then uttered words of defiance $beowulf$ geatman ere his bed he upmounted $beowulf$ boasts of his ability to cope with $grendel$
i hold me no meaner in matters of prowess in warlike achievements than $grendel$ does himself hence i seek not with sword edge to sooth him to slumber of life to bereave him though well i am able
and bade him bide with his #battle# equipments we will fight with nature weapons only no #battle# skill has he that blows he should strike me to shatter my shield though sure he is mighty
in strife and destruction but struggling by night we shall do without edges dare he to look for weaponless warfare and wise mooded father the glory apportion god ever holy
then the brave mooded #hero# bent to his slumber the pillow received the cheek of the noble the geatish warriors lie down
god may decide who shall conquer on which hand soever to him seemeth proper and many a martial mere thane attending sank to his slumber
that ever thereafter any should hope to be happy at home #hero# friends visit or the lordly troop castle where he lived from his childhood they had heard how slaughter had snatched from the wine hall had recently ravished of the race of the scyldings
seemed it unlikely they thought it very unlikely that they should ever see their homes again but god raised up a deliverer
but the lord to them granted the weaving of war speed to wederish #hero# aid and comfort that every opponent by one man war might they worsted and vanquished god rules the world
too many by far by the might of himself the truth is established that god almighty hath governed for ages kindreds and nations
a night very lurid $grendel$ comes to heorot the trav ler at twilight came tramping and striding the warriors were sleeping who should watch the horned building only one warrior is awake
mid earthmen twas stablished th implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them to the land of shadows if the lord were unwilling but serving as warder in terror to foemen he angrily bided the issue of #battle#
the latter takes the #passage# as meaning that $grendel$ though mighty and formidable has no skill in the art of war

one only excepted gr understood gódra as meaning advantages in #battle# this rendering so rejects usually rendered then he translates when and connects its clause with the foregoing sentence
with all deference to this acute scholar i must say that it seems to me that the poet is exhausting his resources to bring out clearly the supreme event on which the whole subsequent action turns
first he $grendel$ came in the wan night second he came from the moor third he came to the hall
these changes he makes to reduce the number of cóm as principal verbs cf time #place# from which #place# to which are all given
xii $grendel$ and $beowulf$ $grendel$ comes from the fens neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then $grendel$ going god anger bare he
the monster intended some one of earthmen in the hall building grand to entrap and make way with he goes towards the joyous building
he went under welkin where well he knew of the wine joyous building brilliant with plating gold hall of earthmen not the earliest occasion this was not his first visit there
he the home and manor of $son_of_hrothgar$ had sought ne er found he in life days later nor earlier hardier #hero# hall thanes more sturdy
then came to the building the warrior marching his horrid fingers tear the door open bereft of his joyance the door quickly opened on
fire hinges fastened when his fingers had touched it the fell one had flung then his fury so bitter open the entrance
early thereafter the foeman trod the shining hall pavement he strides furiously into the hall strode he angrily from the eyes of him glimmered a lustre unlovely likest to fire
he beheld in the hall the #hero# in numbers a circle of kinsmen sleeping together he exults over his supposed prey
the life from his #body# horrible demon ere morning came since fate had allowed him fate has decreed that he shall devour no more #hero#
a throng of thanemen then his thoughts were exultant he minded to sunder from each of the thanemen $beowulf$ suffers from suspense
the prospect of plenty providence willed not to permit him any more of men under heaven to eat in the night time
$higelac$ kinsman great sorrow endured how the dire mooded creature in unlooked for assaults were likely to bear him no thought had the monster of deferring the matter $grendel$ immediately seizes a sleeping warrior and devours him
bit his bone prison the blood drank in currents swallowed in mouthfuls he soon had the dead man feet and hands too eaten entirely
but on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of a soldier asleep suddenly tore him nearer he strode then the stout hearted warrior $beowulf$ and $grendel$ grapple
snatched as he slumbered seizing with hand grip forward the foeman foined with his hand caught he quickly the cunning deviser
this early discovered the master of malice that in middle earth regions neath the whole of the heavens no hand grapple greater the monster is amazed at $beowulf$ strength
in any man else had he ever encountered fearful in spirit faint mooded waxed he not off could betake him death he was pondering
on his elbow he rested he is anxious to flee would fly to his covert seek the devils assembly his calling no more was the same he had followed long in his lifetime
the liege kinsman worthy $beowulf$ recalls his boast of the evening and determines to fulfil it of $higelac$ minded his speech of the evening
stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him his fingers crackled the giant was outward the earl stepped farther
the famous one minded to flee away farther if he found an occasion and off and away avoiding delay to fly to the fen moors he fully was ware of the strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman
twas a luckless day for $grendel$ twas an ill taken journey that the injury bringing harrying harmer to heorot wandered the hall groans
the palace re echoed to all of the danemen dwellers in castles to each of the bold ones earlmen was terror
twas a marvellous wonder that the wine hall withstood then the bold in #battle# bent not to earthward excellent earth hall but within and without it was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron by the art of the armorer
angry they both were archwarders raging rattled the building off from the sill there bent mead benches many as men have informed me adorned with gold work where the grim ones did struggle
the scylding wise men weened ne er before that by might and main strength a man under heaven might break it in pieces bone decked resplendent crush it by cunning unless clutch of the fire
novel enough on the north danes fastened a terror of anguish on all of the men there who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining the song of defeat from the foeman of heaven heard him hymns of horror howl and his sorrow hell bound bewailing
in smoke should consume it the sound mounted upward $grendel$ cries terrify the danes he held him too firmly who was strongest of main strength of men of that era

for no cause whatever would the earlmen defender leave in life joys the loathsome newcomer he deemed his existence utterly useless to men under heaven
many a noble of $beowulf$ brandished his #battle# sword old would guard the life of his lord and protector the far famous chieftain if able to do so while waging the warfare this wist they but little brave #battle# thanes while his #body# intending no weapon would harm $grendel$ he bore a charmed life
to slit into slivers and seeking his spirit that the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons of all on the earth nor any of war bills was willing to injure but weapons of victory swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with
his death at that time must prove to be wretched and the far away spirit widely should journey into enemies power
this plainly he saw then who with mirth of mood malice no little had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen to god he was hostile that his #body# would fail him but $higelac$ hardy henchman and kinsman held him by the hand hateful to other $grendel$ is sorely wounded
was each one if living a #body# wound suffered the direful demon damage incurable his #body# bursts was seen on his shoulder his sinews were shivered his #body# did burst
to $beowulf$ was given glory in #battle# $grendel$ from thenceward must flee and hide him in the fen cliffs and marshes sick unto death his dwelling must look for unwinsome and woful he wist the more fully the monster flees away to hide in the moors
the end of his earthly existence was nearing his life days limits at last for the danemen when the slaughter was over their wish was accomplished
the comer from far land had cleansed then of evil wise and valiant the war hall of $son_of_hrothgar$ saved it from violence he joyed in the night work

the craft begot evil they erstwhile had suffered and were forced to endure from crushing oppression their manifold misery twas a manifest token $beowulf$ suspends $grendel$ hand and arm in heorot

xiv rejoicing of the danes at early dawn warriors from far and near come together to hear of the night adventures
folk princes fared then from far and from near through long stretching journeys to look at the wonder the footprints of the foeman
in the mist of the morning many a warrior stood round the gift hall as the story is told me few of the warriors few warriors lamented $grendel$ destruction
who gazed on the foot tracks of the inglorious creature his parting from life pained very deeply how weary in spirit off from those regions
in combats conquered he carried his traces fated and flying to the flood of the nickers $grendel$ blood dyes the waters
there in bloody billows bubbled the currents the angry eddy was everywhere mingled and seething with gore welling with sword blood he death doomed had hid him when reaved of his joyance

mighty achievements many things hidden the strife of the wælsing the wide going ventures the children of men knew of but little
the feud and the fury but fitela with him when suchlike matters he minded to speak of uncle to nephew as in every contention
each to other was ever devoted a numerous host of the race of the scathers they had slain with the sword edge
to sigmund accrued then no little of glory when his life days were over since he sturdy in struggle had destroyed the great dragon
neath the hoar grayish stone he the $son_of_hrothgar$ of the atheling unaided adventured the perilous project not present was fitela yet the fortune befell him of forcing his weapon through the marvellous dragon that it stood in the wall well honored weapon the worm was slaughtered
the hoard treasure keeper the great one had gained then by his glorious achievement to reap from the ring hoard richest enjoyment
as best it did please him his vessel he loaded shining ornaments on the ship bosom carried kinsman of wæls the drake in heat melted
he was farthest famed of fugitive pilgrims mid wide scattered world folk for works of great prowess war troopers shelter hence waxed he in honor
sigemund was widely famed heremod an unfortunate danish king is introduced by way of contrast afterward heremod #hero# strength failed him
his vigor and valor mid venomous haters to the hands of foemen he was foully delivered offdriven early agony billows
oppressed him too long to his people he became then to all the athelings an ever great burden and the daring one journey in days of yore

he to all men became then far more beloved $higelac$ kinsman to kindreds and races to his friends much dearer him malice assaulted
unlike sigemund and $beowulf$ heremod was a burden to his people $beowulf$ is an honor to his race the story is resumed

since god did not will it to keep him from going not held him that firmly hated opposer too swift was the foeman
he suffered his hand behind him to linger his arm and shoulder to act as watcher he left his hand and arm behind
no shadow of solace the woe begone creature found him there nathless the hated destroyer liveth no longer lashed for his evils but sorrow hath seized him in snare meshes hath him close in its clutches keepeth him writhing in baleful bonds there banished for evil

i good over measure enjoyed him while able and the ancient heirloom unferth permit thou the famed one to have the heavy sword splendid

he glanced long the building and turned by the wall then $higelac$ vassal raging and wrathful raised his #battle# sword strong by the handle
the edge was not useless to the #hero# in #battle# but he speedily wished to give $grendel$ requital for the many assaults he had worked on the west danes not once but often when he slew in slumber the subjects of $son_of_hrothgar$ swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers
of the folk of the danemen and fully as many carried away a horrible prey he gave him requital grim raging champion $beowulf$ sees the #body# of $grendel$ and cuts off his head

nor took he of jewels more in the dwelling lord of the weders though they lay all around him than the head and the handle handsome with jewels the brand early melted burnt was the weapon

the gray haired chieftain the gold fashioned sword hilt old work of giants was thereupon given since the fall of the fiends it fell to the keeping of the wielder of danemen the wonder smith labor and the bad mooded being abandoned this world then opponent of god victim of murder and also his mother it went to the keeping of the best of the world kings where waters encircle who the scot divided in scylding dominion
$son_of_hrothgar$ discoursed the hilt he regarded the ancient heirloom where an old time contention beginning was graven the gurgling currents the flood slew thereafter the race of the giants they had proved themselves daring that people was loth to it had belonged to a race hateful to god
$son_of_hrothgar$ looks closely at the old sword the lord everlasting through lash of the billows the father gave them final requital

inquiring he found how the feud had arisen hate to his #hero# the highly famed gem vessel was brought to his keeping through the hand of th informer
a guide leads the way but that in the throng was thirteenth of #hero# that caused the beginning of conflict so bitter captive and wretched must sad mooded thenceward very reluctantly
the cave under earth not far from the ocean the anger of eddies which inward was full of jewels and wires a warden uncanny warrior weaponed wardered the treasure old under earth no easy possession for any of earth folk access to get to
point out the #place# he passed then unwillingly to the spot where he knew of the notable cavern then the #battle# brave atheling sat on the naze edge
his fireside companions woe was his spirit death boding wav ring weird very near him who must seize the old #hero# his soul treasure look for dragging aloof his life from his #body# not flesh hidden long was the folk leader spirit
while the gold friend of geatmen gracious saluted $beowulf$ spake ecgtheow $son_of_hrothgar$ $beowulf$ retrospect i survived in my youth days many a conflict #hour# of onset that all i remember
i was seven winters old when the jewel prince took me high lord of #hero# at the hands of my father $hrethel$ the #hero# king
had me in keeping $hrethel$ took me when i was seven gave me treasure and feasting our kinship remembered not ever was i any less dear to him
he treated me as a $son_of_hrothgar$ knight in the boroughs than the bairns of his household herebald and hæthcyn and $higelac$ mine
to the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsman was murder bed strewn since him hæthcyn from horn bow one of the brothers accidentally kills another
his sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow erred in his aim and injured his kinsman one brother the other with blood sprinkled spear no fee could compound for such a calamity
twas a feeless fight finished in malice sad to his spirit the folk prince however had to part from existence with vengeance untaken
to live to see his $son_of_hrothgar$ as he rideth young on the gallows then measures he chanteth a song of sorrow when his $son_of_hrothgar$ is hanging for the raven delight and aged and hoary
every morning his offspring departure is constant recalled he cares not to wait for the birth of an heir in his borough enclosures since that one through death pain the deeds hath experienced
he #heart# grieved beholds in the house of his $son_of_hrothgar$ the wine building wasted the wind lodging #place# reaved of their roaring the riders are sleeping
a parallel case is supposed so to hoar headed #hero# tis heavily crushing he is unable to offer any assistance
gomelum ceorle takes these words as referring to $hrethel$ but the translator here departs from his editor by understanding the poet to refer to a hypothetical old man introduced as an illustration of a father sorrow
the knights in the grave there no sound of the harp wood joy in the yards as of yore were familiar hrethrel had certainly never seen a $son_of_hrothgar$ of his ride on the gallows to feed the crows
the #passage# beginning swá bið géomorlic seems to be an effort to reach a full simile as so as it is mournful for an old man etc so the defence of the weders bore #heart# sorrow etc
the verses to would be parenthetical the poet feelings being so strong as to interrupt the simile the punctuation of the fourth edition would be better a comma after galgan
the translation may be indicated as follows just as it is sad for an old man to see his $son_of_hrothgar$ ride young on the gallows when he himself is uttering mournful measures a sorrowful song while his $son_of_hrothgar$ hangs for a comfort to the raven and he old and infirm cannot render him any kelp he is constantly reminded etc so the defence of the weders etc
xxxv reminiscences continued $beowulf$ last #battle# he seeks then his chamber singeth a woe song one for the other all too extensive seemed homesteads and plains
mindful of herebald #heart# sorrow carried stirred with emotion nowise was able to wreak his ruin on the ruthless destroyer he was unable to follow the warrior with hatred with deeds that were direful though dear he not held him
then pressed by the pang this pain occasioned him he gave up glee god light elected he left to his sons as the man that is rich does his land and fortress when from life he departed
so the helm of the weders $hrethel$ grieves for herebald strife between swedes and geats then was crime and hostility twixt swedes and geatmen er wide stretching water warring was mutual
burdensome hatred when $hrethel$ had perished and ongentheow offspring were active and valiant wished not to hold to peace oversea but round hreosna beorh often accomplished cruelest massacre
this my kinsman avengèd the feud and fury as tis found on inquiry though one of them paid it with forfeit of life joys hæthcyn fall at ravenswood
then i heard that at morning one brother the other with edges of irons egged on to murder where ongentheow maketh onset on eofor
with price that was hard the struggle became then fatal to hæthcyn lord of the geatmen the helmet crashed the hoary haired scylfing sword smitten fell his hand then remembered feud hate sufficient refused not the death blow
i requited him for the jewels he gave me the gems that he gave me with jewel bright sword i quited in contest as occasion was offered land he allowed me life joy at homestead manor to live on
little he needed from gepids or danes or in sweden to look for trooper less true with treasure to buy him mong foot soldiers ever in front
alone in the vanguard and evermore gladly warfare shall wage while this weapon endureth that late and early often did serve me
when i proved before #hero# the slayer of dæghrefn knight of the hugmen he by no means was suffered to the king of the frisians to carry the jewels
i would hie me $beowulf$ refers to his having slain dæghrefn the breast decoration but the banner possessor bowed in the #battle# brave mooded atheling
no weapon was slayer but war grapple broke then the surge of his spirit his #body# destroying now shall weapon edge make war for the treasure and hand and firm sword
$beowulf$ spake then boast words uttered the latest occasion he boasts of his youthful prowess and declares himself still fearless
i braved in my youth days #battle# unnumbered still am i willing the struggle to look for fame deeds perform folk warden prudent if the hateful despoiler forth from his cavern seeketh me out
each of the #hero# helm bearers sturdy he thereupon greeted his last salutations belovèd co liegemen his last salutation no brand would i bear
no blade for the dragon wist i a way my word boast to complish else with the monster as with $grendel$ i did it but fire in the #battle# hot
i expect there furious flame burning so i fixed on my #body# target and war mail the ward of the barrow i ll not flee from a foot length the foeman uncanny
at the wall twill befall us as fate decreeth let fate decide between us each one creator i am eager in spirit with the wingèd war #hero# to away with all boasting
bide on the barrow with burnies protected wait ye here till the #battle# is over earls in armor which of us two may better bear his disaster when the #battle# is over
tis no matter of yours and man cannot do it but me and me only to measure his strength with the monster of malice might deeds to complish
the mighty champion rose by his shield then brave under helmet in #battle# mail went he neath steep rising stone cliffs the strength he relied on of one man alone no work for a coward
then he saw by the wall who a great many #battle# had lived through most worthy when foot troops collided the #place# of strife is described
stone arches standing stout hearted champion saw a brook from the barrow bubbling out thenceward the flood of the fountain was fuming with war flame not nigh to the hoard for season the briefest
i with prowess shall gain the gold or the #battle# direful death woe will drag off your ruler could he brave without burning
the abyss that was yawning the drake was so fiery the prince of the weders caused then that words came from his bosom
so fierce was his fury the firm hearted shouted his #battle# clear voice came in resounding neath the gray colored stone stirred was his hatred $beowulf$ calls out under the stone arches
the hoard ward distinguished the speech of a man time was no longer to look out for friendship the breath of the monster issued forth first vapory war sweat out of the stone cave the terrible encounter
the earth re echoed the earl neath the barrow lifted his shield lord of the geatmen tow rd the terrible stranger the ring twisted creature #heart# was then ready to seek for a struggle
$beowulf$ brandishes his sword the excellent #battle# king first brandished his weapon the ancient heirloom of edges unblunted to the death planners twain was terror from other and stands against his shield
the lord of the troopers intrepidly stood then gainst his high rising shield when the dragon coiled him the dragon coils himself
quickly together in corslet he bided he went then in blazes bended and striding hasting him forward his life and #body#
the targe well protected for time period shorter than wish demanded for the well renowned leader where he then for the first day was forced to be victor famous in #battle# as fate had not willed it
the lord of the geatmen uplifted his hand then smiting the fire drake with sword that was precious that bright on the bone the blade edge did weaken bit more feebly than his folk leader needed
then the barrow protector the dragon rages when the sword blow had fallen was fierce in his spirit flinging his fires flamings of #battle#
burdened with bale griefs gleamed then afar the gold friend of weders $beowulf$ sword fails him boasted no conquests his #battle# sword failed him naked in conflict as by no means
twas no slight undertaking that ecgtheow famous offspring would leave the drake cavern bottom he must live in some region other than this by the will of the dragon
it ought to long trusty weapon as each one of earthmen existence must forfeit twas early thereafter the excellent warriors the combat is renewed
met with each other anew and afresh the hoard ward took #heart# gasps heaved then his bosom the great #hero# is reduced to extremities
sorrow he suffered encircled with fire who the people erst governed his companions by no means were banded about him bairns of the princes his comrades flee
with valorous spirit but they sped to the forest seeking for safety the soul deeps of one were blood is thicker than water
ruffled by care kin love can never aught in him waver who well doth consider the clause rendered by wist i monster gr followed by translates substantially as follows
if i knew how else i might combat the boastful defiance of the monster the translation turns upon wiðgrípan a word not understood
emends and translates i will not flee the space of a foot from the guard of the barrow but there shall be to us a fight at the wall as fate decrees each one creator
the translation of this #passage# is based on unsláw accepted by so in lieu of the long standing ungléaw
the former is taken as an adj limiting sweord the latter as an adj gúð cyning the good war king rash with edges brandished his sword his old relic
the latter gives a more rhetorical anglo saxon poetical sentence xxxvi $wiglaf$ the trusty $beowulf$ is deserted by friends and by sword
the $son_of_hrothgar$ of weohstan was $wiglaf$ entitled shield warrior precious prince of the scylfings ælfhere kinsman he saw his dear liegelord enduring the heat neath helmet and visor
$wiglaf$ remains true the ideal teutonic liegeman then he minded the holding that erst he had given him $wiglaf$ recalls $beowulf$ generosity
each of the folk rights his father had wielded he was hot for the #battle# his hand seized the target the yellow bark shield he unsheathed his old weapon which was known among earthmen as the relic of eanmund ohthere offspring whom exiled and friendless weohstan did slay with sword edge in #battle# and carried his kinsman the clear shining helmet the ring made burnie the old giant weapon that onela gave him his boon fellow armor ready war trappings he the feud did not mention though he fatally smitten the $son_of_hrothgar$ of his brother
many a half year held he the treasures the bill and the burnie till his bairn became able like his father before him fame deeds to complish then he gave him mong geatmen a goodly array of weeds for his warfare he went from life then old on his journey
the wægmunding warriors wealth blessèd homestead twas the earliest time then this is $wiglaf$ first #battle# as liegeman of $beowulf$ that the youthful champion might charge in the #battle# aiding his liegelord his spirit was dauntless
$wiglaf$ uttered many a right saying said to his fellows sad was his spirit $wiglaf$ appeals to the pride of the cowards
nor did kinsman bequest quail at the #battle# this the dragon discovered on their coming together i remember the time when tasting the mead cup we promised in the hall the lord of us all
who gave us these ring treasures that this #battle# equipment swords and helmets we certainly quite him should need of such aid ever befall him how we have forfeited our liegelord confidence
in the war band he chose us for this journey spontaneously stirred us to glory and gave me these jewels since he held and esteemed us trust worthy spearmen hardy helm bearers though this #hero# achievement our lord intended alone to accomplish ward of his people for most of achievements doings audacious he did among earth folk
the day is now come when the ruler of earthmen needeth the vigor of valiant #hero# let us wend us towards him the war prince to succor
our lord is in sore need of us while the heat yet rageth horrible fire fight i would rather die than go home with out my suzerain
meseemeth not proper to bear our #battle# shields back to our country less first we are able to fell and destroy the long hating foeman to defend the life of surely he does not deserve to die alone
god wot in me tis mickle the liefer the blaze should embrace my #body# and eat it with my treasure bestower the prince of the weders
well do i know tisnt earned by his exploits he only of geatmen sorrow should suffer sink in the #battle# brand and helmet to us both shall be common shield cover burnie
through the bale smoke he stalked then went under helmet to the help of his chieftain $wiglaf$ reminds $beowulf$ of his youthful boasts
briefly discoursing $beowulf$ dear perform thou all fully as thou formerly saidst in thy youthful years that while yet thou livedst
thou wouldst let thine honor not ever be lessened thy life thou shalt save mighty in actions atheling undaunted with all of thy vigor the monster advances on them
the dragon came raging wild mooded stranger when these words had been uttered twas the second occasion seeking his enemies men that were hated with hot gleaming fire waves with blaze billows burned the board to its edges the fight armor failed then to furnish assistance
to the youthful spear #hero# but the young agèd stripling quickly advanced neath his kinsman war target since his own had been ground in the grip of the fire
then the warrior king was careful of glory he soundly smote with sword for the #battle# that it stood in the head by hatred driven nægling was shivered the old and iron made his sword fails him
twas denied him that edges of irons were able to help in the #battle# the hand was too mighty which every weapon as i heard on inquiry outstruck in its stroke when to struggle he carried the wonderful war sword it waxed him no better
i ll give thee assistance $beowulf$ strikes at the dragon brand of $beowulf$ in #battle# deceived him the dragon advances on $beowulf$ again
charged on the strong one when chance was afforded heated and war grim seized on his neck with teeth that were bitter he bloody did wax with soul gore seething sword blood in waves boiled
then the people despoiler third of his onsets fierce raging fire drake of feud hate was mindful the #passage# brand burnie is much disputed
in the first #place# some eminent critics assume a gap of at least two half verses úrum being a peculiar form has been much discussed
byrdu scrúd is also a crux suggests býwdu scrúd splendid vestments nor is bám accepted by all béon being suggested

whatever the individual words the #passage# must mean i intend to share with him my equipments of defence for þonne he reads þone rel
pr xxxvii the fatal struggle $beowulf$ last moments $wiglaf$ defends $beowulf$ then i heard that at need of the king of the people
the upstanding earlman exhibited prowess vigor and courage as suited his nature he his head did not guard but the high minded liegeman hand was consumed when he succored his kinsman
so he struck the strife bringing strange comer lower earl thane in armor that in went the weapon gleaming and plated that gan then the fire
the liegelord himself then retained his consciousness brandished his war knife #battle# sharp bitter that he bare on his armor and cuts the dragon
$beowulf$ draws his knife later to lessen the weder lord cut the worm in the middle they had felled the enemy life drove out then puissant prowess
to the prince twas the last of his era of conquest by his own great achievements $beowulf$ wound swells and burns
the pair had destroyed him land chiefs related so a liegeman should prove him a thaneman when needed the latest of world deeds
the wound then began which the earth dwelling dragon erstwhile had wrought him to burn and to swell he soon then discovered that bitterest bale woe in his bosom was raging poison within
the atheling advanced then he sits down exhausted that along by the wall he prudent of spirit might sit on a settle he saw the giant work
how arches of stone strengthened with pillars the earth hall eternal inward supported then the long worthy liegeman laved with his hand the $wiglaf$ bathes his lord head
$beowulf$ answered of his injury spake he his wound that was fatal he was fully aware he had lived his allotted life days enjoying the pleasures of earth then past was entirely his measure of days death very near
far famous chieftain gory from sword edge refreshing the face of his friend lord and ruler sated with #battle# unbinding his helmet $beowulf$ regrets that he has no $son_of_hrothgar$
my $son_of_hrothgar$ i would give now my #battle# equipments had any of heirs been after me granted along of my #body#
this people i governed fifty of winters no king mong my neighbors dared to encounter me with comrades in #battle# try me with terror

to behold the hoard neath the hoar grayish stone well lovèd $wiglaf$ now the worm is a lying sore wounded sleepeth disseized of his treasure
go thou in haste that treasures of old i gold wealth may gaze on together see lying the ether bright jewels be easier able
he did not regard his the dragon head since $beowulf$ had struck it without effect but struck the dragon a little lower down one crux is to find out whose head is meant another is to bring out the antithesis between head and hand
having the heap of hoard gems to yield my life and the land folk whom long i have governed renders
þæt þæt fýr emends to þá þæt fýr when the fire began to grow less intense afterward
this emendation relieves the #passage# of a plethora of conjunctive þæt for gefyldan proposes gefylde the #passage# would read
this gives $beowulf$ the credit of having felled the dragon then they combine to annihilate him for ellen kl suggests
he felled the foe life drove out strength and they then both had destroyed him chieftains related a llne the reading life drove out strength is very unsatisfactory and very peculiar

then heard i that wihstan $son_of_hrothgar$ very quickly these words being uttered heeded his liegelord wounded and war sick went in his armor his well woven ring mail neath the roof of the barrow
den $beowulf$ death $wiglaf$ fulfils his lord behest then the trusty retainer treasure gems many the dragon den victorious saw when the seat he came near to gold treasure sparkling spread on the bottom
cups of the ancients of cleansers bereavèd robbed of their ornaments there were helmets in numbers old and rust eaten arm bracelets many artfully woven
wonder on the wall and the worm creature cavern the ancient dawn flier vessels a standing wealth can easily gold on the sea bottom turn into vanity
each one of earthmen arm him who pleaseth and he saw there lying an all golden banner high er the hoard of hand wonders greatest
linkèd with lacets a light from it sparkled that the floor of the cavern he was able to look on the dragon is not there
to examine the jewels sight of the dragon not any was offered but edge offcarried him $wiglaf$ bears the hoard away
then i heard that the #hero# the hoard treasure plundered the giant work ancient reaved in the cavern bare on his bosom the beakers and platters as himself would fain have it and took off the standard the brightest of beacons the bill had erst injured its edge was of iron the old ruler weapon him who long had watched as ward of the jewels who fire terror carried hot for the treasure rolling in #battle# in middlemost darkness
the messenger hastened not loth to return hurried by jewels curiosity urged him if excellent mooded alive he should find the lord of the weders mortally wounded at the #place# where he left him
mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain his liegelord belovèd at his life end gory he thereupon gan to lave him with water
till murdered he perished till the point of his word piercèd his breast hoard $beowulf$ spake the gold gems he noticed $beowulf$ is rejoiced to see the jewels
for the jewels i look on thanks do i utter for all to the ruler wielder of worship with words of devotion
the old one in sorrow the lord everlasting that he let me such treasures gain for my people ere death overtook me
since i ve bartered the agèd life to me granted for treasure of jewels attend ye henceforward he desires to be held in memory by his people
the wants of the war thanes i can wait here no longer the #battle# famed bid ye to build them a grave hill bright when i burned
at the brim current limit as a memory mark to the men i have governed aloft it shall tower on whale ness uprising that earls of the ocean hereafter may call it $beowulf$ barrow those who barks ever dashing from a distance shall drive er the darkness of waters
the ring that was golden gave to his liegeman the youthful war #hero# his gold flashing helmet his collar and war mail bade him well to enjoy them and last words
thou art latest left of the line of our kindred of wægmunding people weird hath offcarried all of my kinsmen to the creator glory
the #hero# last gift the bold mooded troop lord took from his neck then earls in their vigor i shall after them fare
twas the aged liegelord last spoken word in his musings of spirit ere he mounted the fire the #battle# waves burning from his bosom departed his soul to seek the sainted ones glory
one takes oferhígian as meaning to exceed and inserting hord after gehwone renders the treasure may easily the gold in the ground exceed in value every hoard of man hide it who will
the other takes oferhígian as meaning to render arrogant and giving the sentence a moralizing tone renders substantially as in the #body# of this work
the word oferhígian being vague and little understood two quite distinct translations of this #passage# have arisen cf
the bill of the old lord is by some regarded as $beowulf$ sword by others as that of the ancient possessor of the hoard
ær gescód translated in this work as verb and adverb is by some regarded as a compound participial adj sheathed in brass
et seq the #passage# beginning here is very much disputed xxxix the dead foes $wiglaf$ bitter taunts
$wiglaf$ is sorely grieved to see his lord look so un warlike it had wofully chanced then the youthful retainer to behold on earth
the slayer too lay there of life all bereavèd horrible earth drake harassed with sorrow the dragon has plundered his last hoard
the round twisted monster was permitted no longer to govern the ring hoards but edges of war swords mightily seized him #battle# sharp sturdy leavings of hammers that still from his wounds the flier from farland fell to the earth hard by his hoard house hopped he at midnight
not er through the air nor exulting in jewels suffered them to see him but he sank then to earthward through the #hero# chief handwork
the most ardent belovèd at his life days limit lying there helpless i heard sure it throve then few warriors dared to face the monster
though of every achievement bold he had proved him to run gainst the breath of the venomous scather or the hall of the treasure to trouble with hand blows if he watching had found the ward of the hoard hall on the barrow abiding
$beowulf$ part of the treasure of jewels was paid for with death each of the twain had attained to the end of life so unlasting
but few in the land of liegemen of valor not long was the time till the cowardly thanes come out of the thicket
the tardy at #battle# returned from the thicket the timid truce breakers ten all together who durst not before play with the lances
in the prince of the people pressing emergency they are ashamed of their desertion but blushing with shame with shields they betook them with arms and armor where the old one was lying
he was sitting exhausted foot going fighter not far from the shoulders of the lord of the people would rouse him with water no whit did it help him though he hoped for it keenly
he was able on earth not at all in the leader life to retain and nowise to alter the will of the wielder the world ruler power would govern the actions of each one of #hero# $wiglaf$ is ready to excoriate them
they gazed upon $wiglaf$ as yet he is doing from the young one forthwith then could grim worded greeting be got for him
looked on the hated he who soothness will utter can say that the liegelord who gave you the jewels the ornament armor wherein ye are standing
when on ale bench often he offered to hall men helmet and burnie the prince to his liegemen as best upon earth he was able to find him surely our lord wasted his armor on poltroons
that he wildly wasted his war gear undoubtedly when #battle# ertook him the troop king no need had to glory in comrades yet god permitted him he however got along without you victory wielder with weapon unaided himself to avenge when vigor was needed
i life protection but little was able to give him in #battle# and i gan notwithstanding with some aid i could have saved our liegelord
quickly whose courage had failed him $wiglaf$ discoursed then weohstan his $son_of_hrothgar$ sad mooded #hero# he begins to taunt them helping my kinsman my strength overtaxing
he waxed the weaker when with weapon i smote on my mortal opponent the fire less strongly flamed from his bosom
too few of protectors came round the king at the critical moment gift giving is over with your people the ring lord is dead
cease for your kindred food for the people each of your warriors must needs be bereavèd of rights that he holdeth in landed possessions when faraway nobles shall learn of your leaving your lord so basely what is life without honor

a þá beget with the following sentence that is they make it dependent upon þorfte instead of upon forwurpe
some critics himself in earlier editions put the clause when him xl the messenger of death $wiglaf$ sends the news of $beowulf$ death to liegemen near by
then he charged that the #battle# be announced at the hedge up er the cliff edge where the earl troopers bided the whole of the morning mood wretched sat them bearers of #battle# shields both things expecting
little reserved he of news that was known who the ness cliff did travel but he truly discoursed to all that could hear him the messenger speaks
the end of his lifetime and the coming again of the liegelord belovèd now the free giving friend lord of the folk of the weders the folk prince of geatmen is fast in his death bed
by the deeds of the dragon in death bed abideth along with him lieth his life taking foeman slain with knife wounds he was wholly unable to injure at all the ill planning monster $wiglaf$ sits by our dead lord
$wiglaf$ is sitting offspring of wihstan up over $beowulf$ earl er another whose end day hath reached him head watch holdeth er #hero# unliving
with bite of his sword edge our lord death will lead to attacks from our old foes for friend and for foeman
the folk now expecteth a season of strife when the death of the folk king to frankmen and frisians in far lands is published
when $higelac$ came with an army of vessels faring to friesland where the frankmen in #battle# humbled him and bravely with overmight complished that the mail clad warrior must sink in the #battle# fell mid his folk troop no fret gems presented the atheling to earlmen aye was denied us merewing mercy
the war hatred waxed warm gainst the hugmen $higelac$ death recalled the men of the swedelands for truce or for truth trust i but little
but widely twas known that near ravenswood ongentheow hæthcyn fall referred to sundered hæthcyn the hrethling from life joys when for pride overweening the war scylfings first did seek the geatmen with savage intentions
early did ohthere age laden father old and terrible give blow in requital killing the sea king the queen mother rescued the old one his consort deprived of her gold onela mother and ohthere also
then with vast numbered forces he assaulted the remnant weary with wounds woe often promised the livelong night to the sad hearted war troop
and then followed the feud nursing foemen till hardly reaved of their ruler they ravenswood entered said he at morning would kill them with edges of weapons
aid came after to the anxious in spirit at dawn of the day after $higelac$ bugle and trumpet sound heard they when the good one proceeded and faring followed the flower of the troopers

the blood stainèd trace of swedes and geatmen the death rush of warmen widely was noticed how the folks with each other feud did awaken
the worthy one went then with well beloved comrades old and dejected to go to the fastness ongentheo earl upward then turned him of $higelac$ #battle# he heard on inquiry the exultant one prowess despaired of resistance with earls of the ocean to be able to struggle gainst sea going sailors to save the hoard treasure his wife and his children he fled after thenceward old neath the earth wall
the messenger continues and refers to the feuds of swedes and geats then was offered pursuance to the braves of the swedemen the banner to $higelac$
then with edges of irons was ongentheow driven the gray haired to tarry that the troop ruler had to suffer the power solely of eofor
they fared then forth er the field of protection when the hrethling #hero# hedgeward had thronged them wulf wounds ongentheow
wonred his $son_of_hrothgar$ that for swinge of the edges the blood from his #body# burst out in currents forth neath his hair
wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him he feared not however gray headed scylfing but speedily quited ongentheow gives a stout blow in return
the wasting wound stroke with worse exchange when the king of the thane troop thither did turn him the wise mooded $son_of_hrothgar$ of wonred was powerless to give a return blow to the age hoary man but his head shielding helmet first hewed he to pieces
that flecked with gore perforce he did totter fell to the earth not fey was he yet then but up did he spring though an edge wound had reached him
then $higelac$ vassal valiant and dauntless when his brother lay dead made his broad bladed weapon giant sword ancient defence of the giants bound er the shield wall the folk prince succumbed then ongentheow is slain
there were many attendants who bound up his kinsman carried him quickly when occasion was granted that the #place# of the slain they were suffered to manage
his armor of iron from ongentheow ravished his hard sword hilted and helmet together eofor takes the old king war gear to $higelac$

none upon mid earth needed to twit him with the gifts he gave them when glory they conquered to eofor he also gives his only daughter in marriage
and to eofor then gave he his one only daughter the honor of home as an earnest of favor that the feud and hatred as ween i twill happen

have on her neck rings to adorn her but wretched in spirit bereavèd of gold gems waken the warriors but
the wan coated raven fain over fey ones freely shall gabble shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating

the worm on the field in front of them lying the foeman before them the fire spewing dragon ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors was scorched in the fire as he lay there he measured fifty of feet came forth in the night time
first they beheld there a creature more wondrous they also see the dragon to rejoice in the air thereafter departing to visit his den he in death was then fastened
he would joy in no other earth hollowed caverns there stood round about him beakers and vessels dishes were lying and dear valued weapons
with iron rust eaten as in earth mighty bosom a thousand of winters there they had rested the hoard was under a magic spell
that mighty bequest then with magic was guarded gold of the ancients that earlman not any the ring hall could touch save ruling god only sooth king of vict ries gave whom he wished to god alone could give access to it
he is earth folk protector to open the treasure en to such among mortals as seemed to him proper for góda which seems a surprising epithet for a geat to apply to the terrible ongentheow suggests gomela

the so reading as translated in our #text# means that the banner of the enemy was captured and brought to $higelac$ as a trophy
the rendering given in this translation represents the king as being generous beyond the possibility of reproach but some authorities construe him as plu and understand the #passage# to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received more reward than they were entitled to
the name scyldingas here has caused much discussion and given rise to several theories the most important of which are as follows after the downfall of $son_of_hrothgar$ family $beowulf$ was king of the danes or scyldings
for scyldingas read scylfingas that is after killing eadgils the scylfing prince $beowulf$ conquered his land and held it in subjection
$higelac$ banner followed the swedes in pursuit suggests sæcc higeláces and renders $higelac$ pursuit considers a thoughtless repetition of

the parenthesis is by some emended so as to read he i god is the hope of men he is the hope of #hero#
reading has no parenthesis but says could touch unless god himself true king of victories gave to whom he would to open the treasure the secret #place# of enchanters etc
he thinks that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed gr the last is rejected on many grounds
xlii $wiglaf$ sad story the hoard carried off then twas seen that the journey prospered him little who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden
down neath the wall the warden erst slaughtered some few of the folk troop the feud then thereafter was hotly avengèd
when the strength famous trooper has attained to the end of life days allotted then no longer the man may remain with his kinsmen where mead cups are flowing
tis a wonder where so to $beowulf$ happened when the ward of the barrow assaults he sought for himself had no knowledge
so to doomsday famous folk leaders down did call it with curses who complished it there that that man should be ever of ill deeds convicted confined in foul #place# fastened in hell bonds punished with plagues who this #place# should er ravage
how his leaving this life was likely to happen he cared not for gold rather the wielder favor preferred he first to get sight of $wiglaf$ addresses his comrades
$wiglaf$ discoursed then wihstan his $son_of_hrothgar$ oft many an earlman on one man account must sorrow endure as to us it hath happened
the liegelord belovèd we could little prevail on kingdom keeper counsel to follow not to go to the guardian of the gold hoard but let him lie where he long was live in his dwelling
till the end of the world met we a destiny hard to endure the hoard has been looked at been gained very grimly
too grievous the fate that the prince of the people pricked to come thither i was therein and all of it looked at the building equipments since access was given me
hastily seized i and held in my hands a huge weighing burden of hoard treasures costly hither out bare them to my liegelord belovèd life was yet in him and consciousness also the old one discoursed then much and mournfully commanded to greet you $beowulf$ dying request
not kindly at all entrance permitted he tells them of $beowulf$ last moments within under earth wall bade that remembering the deeds of your friend lord
ye build on the fire hill of corpses a lofty burial barrow broad and far famous as mid world dwelling warriors he was widely most honored while he reveled in riches
let us rouse us and hasten again to see and seek for the treasure the wonder neath wall the way i will show you that close ye may look at ring gems sufficient and gold in abundance
let the bier with promptness fully be fashioned when forth we shall come and lift we our lord then where long he shall tarry well beloved warrior neath the wielder protection
then the $son_of_hrothgar$ of wihstan bade orders be given mood valiant man to many of #hero# holders of homesteads that they hither from far
leaders of liegemen should look for the good one with wood for his pyre the flame shall now swallow the wan fire shall wax the warriors leader
who the rain of the iron often abided when sturdily hurled the storm of the arrows leapt er linden wall the lance rendered service furnished with feathers followed the arrow
$wiglaf$ charges them to build a funeral pyre now the wise mooded $son_of_hrothgar$ of wihstan did summon the best of the braves from the band of the ruler
neath the enemy roof he went with the seven one of the #hero# who fared at the front a fire blazing torch light bare in his hand
when #hero# earls saw it lying in the cavern uncared for entirely rusting to ruin they rued then but little that they hastily hence hauled out the treasure they push the dragon over the wall
he takes seven thanes and enters the den seven together no lot then decided who that hoard should havoc the dear valued jewels the dragon eke pushed they
the worm er the wall let the wave currents take him the waters enwind the ward of the treasures the hoard is laid on a wain
there wounden gold on a wain was uploaded a mass unmeasured the men leader off then the #hero# hoary to whale ness was carried
for gehýdde suggests gehýðde the #passage# would stand as above except the change of hidden to plundered
the #passage# wundur búan took to be a question asking whether it was strange that a man should die when his appointed time had come sees a corruption and makes emendations introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or from old age but should find death in the performance of some deed of daring sees an indirect question introduced by hwár and dependent upon wundur
the reference however would be to the thief not to the dragon a secret is it when the #hero# is to die etc why
may the two clauses not be parallel and the whole #passage# an old english cry of how wonderful is death
s is the best yet offered if wundor means mystery for strude in so suggests stride this would require ravage to be changed to tread
he cared sight of emends so as to read as follows he $beowulf$ had not before seen the favor of the avaricious possessor

this gives a parallel to fretan above the parenthesis would be discarded and the #passage# read now shall the fire consume the wan flame devour the prince of warriors etc
the folk of the geatmen got him then ready a pile on the earth strong for the burning behung with helmets #hero# knights targets and bright shining burnies as he begged they should have them then wailing war #hero# their world famous chieftain their liegelord beloved laid in the middle

the smoke cloud ascended the sad roaring fire mingled with weeping the wind roar subsided till the building of bone it had broken to pieces hot in the #heart#
heavy in spirit they mood sad lamented the men leader ruin and mournful measures the much grieving widow the weders carry out their lord last request
the men of the weders made accordingly a hill on the height high and extensive of sea going sailors to be seen from a distance and the brave one beacon built where the fire was
in ten days space with a wall surrounded it as wisest of world folk could most worthily plan it they placed in the barrow rings and jewels rings and gems are laid in the barrow
all such ornaments as erst in the treasure war mooded men had won in possession the earnings of earlmen to earth they entrusted the gold to the dust where yet it remaineth as useless to mortals as in foregoing eras
round the dead mound rode then the doughty in #battle# bairns of all twelve of the chiefs of the people they mourn for their lord and sing his praises
more would they mourn lament for their ruler speak in measure mention him with pleasure weighed his worth and his warlike achievements mightily commended as tis meet one praise his liegelord in words and love him in spirit when forth from his #body# he fares to destruction

of these a good part were avoided by harrison and sharp the american editors of $beowulf$ in their last edition
several discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the so glossary the rest will i hope be noticed in their fourth edition
as however this book may fall into the hands of some who have no copy of the american edition it seems best to notice all the principal oversights of the german editors
from hám notes and glossary conflict the latter not having been altered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former þær gelýfan sceal dryhtnes
dóme under dóm says the might of the lord while under gelýfan he says the judgment of the lord eal
bencþelu under benc þelu says nom plu while under eal he says nom sing heatho ræmas under ætberan translates to the heathoremes while under heatho ræmas he says heathoræmas reaches breca in the swimming match with $beowulf$
harrison and sharp edition avoid the discrepancy fáh féond scaða under féond scaða says a gleaming sea monster under fáh he says hostile
þancum under onfón says he received the maliciously disposed one under inwit þanc he says he grasped etc níð wundor séon under níð wundor calls this word itself nom sing
onfeng hraðe inwit under séon he translates it as accus sing understanding man as subject of séon and d edition make the correction
forgeaf hilde bille under the second word calls it instr dat while under forgifan he makes it the dat of indir
ecg under brád says das breite hüftmesser mit bronzener klinge under brún ecg he says ihr breites hüftmesser mit blitzender klinge
obj and d edition make the change brád and brún yðelíce under this word makes it modify ástód
if this be right the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong see and appendix sélran gesóhte under sél and gesécan calls these two words accus
plu but this is clearly an error as both are nom plu pred nom and correct under sél
wið sylfne under wið and gesittan says wið near by under self he says opposite þéow is omitted from the glossary
for duguðum under duguð translates this phrase in tüchtigkeit under for by vor der edlen kriegerschaar þær under wealdan translates þær by wo under mótan by da
h and suggest if in both #passage# wunde under wund says dative and under wæl bléate he says accus it is without doubt accus
gebæded under strengo says strengum mit macht under gebæded he translates von den sehnen and correct this discrepancy by rejecting the second reading
parallel with benne strengum bronda be láfe a recent emendation the fourth edition had bronda betost in the fifth edition the editor neglects to change the glossary to suit the new emendation
