$beowulf$ ˈbeɪəwʊlf is an old english epic poem consisting of alliterative lines it is one of the most important works of old english literature
the date of composition is matter of contention among scholars the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript which was produced between and
the story is set in scandinavia $beowulf$ #hero# of the geats comes to the aid of $son_of_hrothgar$ the king of the danes whose mead hall in heorot has been under attack by monster known as $grendel$
the author was an anonymous anglo saxon poet referred to by scholars as the $beowulf$ poet after $beowulf$ slays him $grendel$ mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated
victorious $beowulf$ goes home to geatland götaland in modern sweden and later becomes king of the geats after period of fifty years has passed $beowulf$ defeats dragon but is mortally wounded in the #battle#
after his death his attendants cremate his #body# and erect tower on headland in his memory the full story survives in the manuscript known as the nowell codex
in the manuscript was badly damaged by fire that swept through ashburnham house in london that had collection of medieval manuscripts assembled by sir robert bruce cotton
it has no title in the original manuscript but has become known by the name of the story protagonist the nowell codex is currently housed in the british library
approximate central regions of tribes mentioned in $beowulf$ with the location of the angles in angeln see scandza for details of scandinavia political fragmentation in the century
the events in the poem take #place# over most of the sixth century after the anglo saxons had started migrating to england and before the beginning of the seventh century time when the anglo saxons were either newly arrived or were still in close contact with their germanic kinsmen in northern germany and southern scandinavia
some suggest that $beowulf$ was first composed in the century at rendlesham in east anglia as the sutton hoo ship burial shows close connections with scandinavia and the east anglian royal dynasty the wuffingas may have been descendants of the geatish wulfings
others have associated this poem with the court of king alfred the great or with the court of king cnut the great
the stories in the poem may have been brought to england by people of geatish origins the poem blends fictional legendary and historic elements
although $beowulf$ himself is not mentioned in any other anglo saxon manuscript scholars generally agree that many of the other figures referred to in $beowulf$ also appear in scandinavian sources
this concerns not only individuals g healfdene hroðgar halga hroðulf eadgils and ohthere but also clans g scyldings scylfings and wulfings and certain events g the #battle# between eadgils and onela
the raid by king hygelac into frisia is mentioned by gregory of tours in his history of the franks and can be dated to around
in denmark recent archaeological excavations at lejre where scandinavian tradition located the seat of the scyldings i heorot have revealed that hall was built in the mid century exactly the time period of $beowulf$
the majority view appears to be that people such as king hroðgar and the scyldings in $beowulf$ are based on historical people from
specific works are designated in the following section three halls each about metres ft long were found during the excavation century scandinavia
like the finnesburg fragment and several shorter surviving poems $beowulf$ has consequently been used as source of information about scandinavian figures such as eadgils and hygelac and about continental germanic figures such as offa king of the continental angles
finds from the western mound left excavated in at gamla uppsala sweden support $beowulf$ and the sagas century archaeological evidence may confirm elements of the $beowulf$ story
when the western mound to the left in the photo was excavated in the finds showed that powerful man was buried in large barrow on bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings
eadgils was buried at uppsala according to snorri sturluson the eastern mound was excavated in and contained the remains of woman or woman and young man
the protagonist $beowulf$ #hero# of the geats comes to the aid of $son_of_hrothgar$ king of the danes whose great hall heorot is plagued by the monster $grendel$
the middle barrow has not been excavated $beowulf$ kills $grendel$ with his bare hands and $grendel$ mother with giant sword that he found in her lair
later in his life $beowulf$ becomes king of the geats and finds his realm terrorized by dragon some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in burial mound
$beowulf$ decides to follow the dragon to its lair at earnanæs but only his young swedish relative $wiglaf$ whose name means remnant of valour dares to join him
he attacks the dragon with the help of his thegns or servants but they do not succeed $beowulf$ finally slays the dragon but is mortally wounded in the struggle
$beowulf$ is considered an epic poem in that the main character is #hero# who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts
the poem also begins in medias res or simply in the middle of things which is characteristic of the epics of antiquity
he is cremated and burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour although the poem begins with $beowulf$ arrival $grendel$ attacks have been an ongoing event
an elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of as well as their interactions with each other debts owed and repaid and deeds of valour
the poem begins and ends with funerals at the beginning of the poem for scyld scefing and at the end for $beowulf$
the warriors form kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord $beowulf$ begins with the story of $son_of_hrothgar$ who constructed the great hall heorot for himself and his warriors
in it he his wife wealhtheow and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating $grendel$ troll like monster said to be descended from the biblical cain is pained by the sounds of joy
$grendel$ attacks the hall and kills and devours many of $son_of_hrothgar$ warriors while they sleep $son_of_hrothgar$ and his people helpless against $grendel$ abandon heorot
$beowulf$ young warrior from geatland hears of $son_of_hrothgar$ troubles and with his king permission leaves his homeland to assist $son_of_hrothgar$ $beowulf$ and his men spend the night in heorot
$beowulf$ refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of $grendel$ when $grendel$ enters the hall $beowulf$ who has been feigning sleep leaps up to clench $grendel$ hand
$grendel$ and $beowulf$ #battle# each other violently $beowulf$ retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid but their blades cannot pierce $grendel$ skin
finally $beowulf$ tears $grendel$ arm from his #body# at the shoulder and $grendel$ runs to his home in the marshes where he dies
$beowulf$ displays the whole of $grendel$ shoulder and arm his awesome grasp for all to see at heorot this display would fuel $grendel$ mother anger in revenge
the next night after celebrating $grendel$ defeat $son_of_hrothgar$ and his men sleep in heorot $grendel$ mother angry that her $son_of_hrothgar$ has been killed sets out to get revenge
earlier after the award of treasure the geat had been given another lodging his assistance would be absent in this #battle#
$grendel$ mother violently kills æschere who is $son_of_hrothgar$ most loyal fighter and escapes $son_of_hrothgar$ $beowulf$ and their men track $grendel$ mother to her lair under lake
after stipulating number of conditions to $son_of_hrothgar$ in case of his death including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by unferth of $beowulf$ estate $beowulf$ jumps into the lake and while harassed by water monsters gets to the bottom where he finds cavern
unferð warrior who had earlier challenged him presents $beowulf$ with his sword hrunting $grendel$ mother pulls him in and she and $beowulf$ engage in fierce combat
at first $grendel$ mother appears to prevail and hrunting proves incapable of hurting the woman she throws $beowulf$ to the ground and sitting astride him tries to kill him with short sword but $beowulf$ is saved by his armour
travelling further into $grendel$ mother lair $beowulf$ discovers $grendel$ corpse and severs his head with the sword whose blade melts because of the hot blood
$beowulf$ spots another sword hanging on the wall and apparently made for giants and cuts her head off with it $beowulf$ swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait
carrying the hilt of the sword and $grendel$ head he presents them to $son_of_hrothgar$ upon his return to heorot $son_of_hrothgar$ gives $beowulf$ many gifts including the sword nægling his family heirloom
the events prompt long reflection by the king sometimes referred to as $son_of_hrothgar$ sermon in which he urges $beowulf$ to be wary of pride and to reward his thegns
one day fifty years after $beowulf$ #battle# with $grendel$ mother slave steals golden cup from the lair of dragon at earnanæs
$beowulf$ face to face with the fire breathing dragon $beowulf$ returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people when the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen it leaves its cave in rage burning everything in sight
$beowulf$ and his warriors come to fight the dragon but $beowulf$ tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow
$beowulf$ descends to do #battle# with the dragon but finds himself outmatched his men upon seeing this and fearing for their lives retreat into the woods
one of his men $wiglaf$ however in great distress at $beowulf$ plight comes to his aid the two slay the dragon but $beowulf$ is mortally wounded
after $beowulf$ dies $wiglaf$ remains by his side grief stricken when the rest of the men finally return $wiglaf$ bitterly admonishes them blaming their cowardice for $beowulf$ death
afterward $beowulf$ is ritually burned on great pyre in geatland while his people wail and mourn him fearing that without him the geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes
the dating of $beowulf$ has attracted considerable scholarly attention and opinion differs as to whether it was first written in the century or whether the composition of the poem was nearly contemporary with its eleventh century manuscript and whether proto version of the poem possibly version of the bear $son_of_hrothgar$ tale was orally transmitted before being transcribed in its present form
afterwards barrow visible from the sea is built in his memory $beowulf$ lines albert lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of performance though likely taken at more than one sitting
and tolkien conviction that the poem dates to the century has been defended by tom shippey leonard neidorf rafael pascual and d
the claim to an early century date depends in part on scholars who argue that rather than the transcription of tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk $beowulf$ reflects an original interpretation of an earlier version of the story by the manuscript two scribes
on the other hand some scholars argue that linguistic palaeographical metrical and onomastic considerations align to support date of composition in the first half of the eighth century in particular the poem regular observation of etymological length distinctions max kaluza law has been thought to demonstrate date of composition in the first half of the eighth century
hutcheson for instance does not believe kaluza law can be used to date the poem while claiming that the weight of all the evidence fulk presents in his book tells strongly in favour of an eighth century date
an analysis of several old english poems by team including neidorf suggests that $beowulf$ is the work of single author remounted page british library cotton vitellius
the poem is known only from single manuscript which is estimated to date from close to ad in which it appears with other works
a xv $beowulf$ survives in single manuscript dated on palaeographical grounds to the late or early century the $beowulf$ manuscript is known as the nowell codex gaining its name from century scholar laurence nowell
a xv because it was one of sir robert bruce cotton holdings in the cotton library in the middle of the century
the official designation is british library cotton vitellius many private antiquarians and book collectors such as sir robert cotton used their own library classification systems
a xv translates as the book from the left on shelf the top shelf of the bookcase with the bust of roman emperor vitellius standing on top of it in cotton collection
kevin kiernan argues that nowell most likely acquired it through william cecil baron burghley in when nowell entered cecil household as tutor to his ward edward de vere earl of oxford
the earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the nowell codex was made sometime between and by franciscus junius the younger
cotton vitellius the ownership of the codex before nowell remains mystery the reverend thomas smith and humfrey wanley both catalogued the cotton library in which the nowell codex was held
the $beowulf$ manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in between george hickes wanley assistant and wanley
in the letter to wanley hickes responds to an apparent charge against smith made by wanley that smith had failed to mention the $beowulf$ script when cataloguing cotton ms
smith catalogue appeared in and wanley in vitellius a xv hickes replies to wanley i can find nothing yet of beowulph
kiernan theorised that smith failed to mention the $beowulf$ manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex
it suffered damage in the cotton library fire at ashburnham house in since then parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters
rebinding efforts though saving the manuscript from much degeneration have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem causing further loss
kevin kiernan in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript used fibre optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding erasure or ink blotting
the $beowulf$ manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first lines before breaking off in mid sentence
the first scribe made point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common west saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features
the second scribe who wrote the remainder with difference in handwriting noticeable after line seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest
as result the second scribe script retains more archaic dialectic features which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem cultural context
the second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist of the two as he did not modify the spelling of the #text# as he wrote but rather copied what he saw in front of him
while both scribes appear to proofread their work there are nevertheless many errors in the way that it is currently bound the $beowulf$ manuscript is followed by the old english poem judith
worm holes found in the last leaves of the $beowulf$ manuscript that arent present in the judith manuscript suggest that at one point $beowulf$ ended the volume
the rubbed appearance of some leaves also suggest that the manuscript stood on shelf unbound as is known to have been the case with other old english manuscripts
from knowledge of books held in the library at malmesbury abbey and available as source works and from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the #text# the transcription may have taken #place# there
the question of whether $beowulf$ was passed down through oral tradition prior to its present manuscript form has been the subject of much debate and involves more than simply the issue of its composition
rather given the implications of the theory of oral formulaic composition and oral tradition the question concerns how the poem is to be understood and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate
judith was written by the same scribe that completed $beowulf$ as evidenced through similar writing style scholarly discussion about $beowulf$ in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the and
the debate might be framed starkly as follows on the one hand we can hypothesise poem put together from various tales concerning the #hero# the $grendel$ episode the $grendel$ mother story and the fire drake narrative
these fragments would have been told for many years in tradition and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next
the poem is composed orally and extemporaneously and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral pagan germanic heroic and tribal
on the other hand one might posit poem which is composed by literate scribe who acquired literacy by way of learning latin and absorbing latinate culture and ways of thinking probably monk and therefore profoundly christian in outlook
there is third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can
it sees more than one christianity and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem it sees the poem as initially the product of literate christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the christian himself perhaps convert or one whose forebears had been pagan poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of masterful repurposing of poetry from the oral tradition
crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of oral formulaic composition which hypothesises that epic poems were at least to some extent improvised by whoever was reciting them and only much later written down
in his landmark work the singer of tales albert lord refers to the work of francis peabody magoun and others saying the documentation is complete thorough and accurate
on this view the pagan references would be sort of decorative archaising this exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that $beowulf$ was composed orally
while themes inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event such as the arming the #hero# do exist across anglo saxon and other germanic works some scholars conclude that anglo saxon poetry is mix of oral formulaic and literate patterns arguing that the poems both were composed on word by word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns
larry benson argued that the interpretation of $beowulf$ as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyse the poem in unified manner and with due attention to the poet creativity
examination of $beowulf$ and other old english literature for evidence of oral formulaic composition has met with mixed response instead he proposed that other pieces of germanic literature contain kernels of tradition from which $beowulf$ borrows and expands upon
few years later ann watts argued against the imperfect application of one theory to two different traditions traditional homeric oral formulaic poetry and anglo saxon poetry
thomas gardner agreed with watts arguing that the $beowulf$ #text# is of too varied nature to be completely constructed from set formulae and themes
john miles foley wrote referring to the $beowulf$ debate that while comparative work was both necessary and valid it must be conducted with view to the particularities of given tradition foley argued with view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume or depend upon ultimately unverifiable assumptions about composition and instead delineate more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality
finally in the view of ursula schaefer the question of whether the poem was oral or literate becomes something of red herring
schaefer concept of vocality offers neither compromise nor synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand germanic pagan and oral and on the other latin derived christian and literate but as stated by monika otter a tertium quid modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has logic and aesthetic of its own
icelandic scholar grímur jónsson thorkelin made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in and published the results in working as part of danish government historical research commission
in this model the poem is created and is interpretable within both noetic horizons he made one himself and had another done by professional copyist who knew no anglo saxon
while the recovery of at least letters can be attributed to them their accuracy has been called into question and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in thorkelin time is uncertain
list of translations and artistic depictions of $beowulf$ a great number of translations and adaptations are available in poetry and prose
andy orchard in critical companion to $beowulf$ lists representative translations in his bibliography while the arizona center for medieval and renaissance studies published marijane osborn annotated list of over translations and adaptations in
since that time however the manuscript has crumbled further making these transcripts prized witness to the #text# main article $beowulf$ has been translated into at least other languages
in the historian sharon turner translated selected verses into modern english this was followed in by john josias conybeare who published an edition in english paraphrase and latin verse translation
in grímur jónsson thorkelin published the first complete edition in latin f grundtvig reviewed this edition in and created the first complete verse translation in danish in
in john mitchell kemble created an important literal translation in english in william morris a wyatt published the ninth english translation
in francis barton gummere full translation in english imitative meter was published and was used as the #text# of gareth hinds graphic novel based on $beowulf$ in
first published in frederick klaeber $beowulf$ and the fight at finnsburg which included the poem in old english an extensive glossary of old english terms and general background information became the central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their translations
many retellings of $beowulf$ for children began appearing in the century seamus heaney translation of the poem referred to by howell chickering and many others as heaneywulf was widely publicized
r fulk of indiana university published the first facing page edition and translation of the entire nowell codex manuscript in the dumbarton oaks medieval library series in
following research in the king college london archives carl kears proposed that john porter translation published in by bill griffiths pirate press was the first complete verse translation of the poem entirely accompanied by facing page old english
translating $beowulf$ is one of the subjects of the publication $beowulf$ at kalamazoo containing section with essays on translation and section with reviews of heaney translation some of which compare heaney work with that of anglo saxon scholar roy liuzza
j r tolkien long awaited translation edited by his $son_of_hrothgar$ christopher was published in as $beowulf$ translation and commentary this also includes tolkien own retelling of the story of $beowulf$ in his tale sellic spell
maria dahvana headley published the mere wife in retelling the story from the point of view of $grendel$ mother neither identified sources nor analogues for $beowulf$ can be definitively proven but many conjectures have been made
these are important in helping historians understand the $beowulf$ manuscript as possible source texts or influences would suggest time frames of composition geographic boundaries within which it could be composed or range both spatial and temporal of influence i when it was popular and where its popularity took it
there are scandinavian sources international folkloric sources and celtic sources century studies proposed that $beowulf$ was translated from lost original scandinavian work but this idea was quickly abandoned
but that view was later debunked by carl wilhelm von sydow who pointed out that $beowulf$ is fundamentally christian and written at time when any norse tale would have most likely been pagan
but scandinavian works have continued to be studied as possible source the epic possible connection to grettis saga an icelandic family saga was made early on by guðbrandur vigfússon
grettis saga is story about grettir ásmundarson great grandson of an icelandic settler and so cannot be as old as $beowulf$
however friedrich panzer wrote thesis in which both $beowulf$ and grettis saga drew from common folkloric source and this encouraged even detractor such as w lawrence to reposition his view and entertain the possibility that certain elements in the saga such as the waterfall in #place# of the mere retained an older form
the viability of this connection has enjoyed enduring support and was characterized as one of the few scandinavian analogues to receive general consensus of potential connection by theodore andersson
but that same year magnús fjalldal published volume challenging the perception that there is close parallel and arguing that tangential similarities were being overemphasized as analogies
another candidate for an analogue or possible source is the story of hrolf kraki and his servant the legendary bear shapeshifter bodvar bjarki
axel olrik claimed that on the contrary this saga was reworking of $beowulf$ and others followed suit the story survives in old norse hrólfs saga kraka and saxo gesta danorum
hrolf kraki one of the skjöldungs even appears as hrothulf in the anglo saxon epic hence story about him and his followers may have developed as early as the century
friedrich panzer wrote thesis that the first part of $beowulf$ the $grendel$ story incorporated preexisting folktale material and that the folktale in question was of the bear $son_of_hrothgar$ tale bärensohnmärchen type which has surviving examples all over the world
this tale type was later catalogued as international folktale type now formally entitled the three stolen princesses type in hans uther catalogue although the bear $son_of_hrothgar$ is still used in $beowulf$ criticism if not so much in folkloristic circles
however although this folkloristic approach was seen as step in the right direction the bear $son_of_hrothgar$ tale has later been regarded by many as not close enough parallel to be viable choice which has emerged as more attractive folk tale parallel according to assessment by andersson
similarity of the epic to the irish folktale the hand and the child had already been noted by albert cook and others even earlier swedish folklorist carl wilhelm von sydow then made strong argument for the case of parallelism in the hand and the child because the folktale type demonstrated monstrous arm motif that corresponded with $beowulf$ wrenching off $grendel$ arm
for no such correspondence could be perceived in the bear $son_of_hrothgar$ tale or grettis saga james carney and martin puhvel also agree with this hand and the child contextualisation
puhvel supported the hand and the child theory through such motifs as in andersson words the more powerful giant mother the mysterious light in the cave the melting of the sword in blood the phenomenon of #battle# rage swimming prowess combat with water monsters underwater adventures and the bear hug style of wrestling
attempts to find classical or late latin influence or analogue in $beowulf$ are almost exclusively linked with homer odyssey or virgil aeneid
work also supported the homeric influence stating that encounter between $beowulf$ and unferth was parallel to the encounter between odysseus and euryalus in books of the odyssey even to the point of both characters giving the #hero# the same gift of sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the #hero# prowess
this theory of homer influence on $beowulf$ remained very prevalent in the but started to die out in the following decade when handful of critics stated that the two works were merely comparative literature although greek was known in late century england
in albert cook suggested homeric connection due to equivalent formulas metonymies and analogous voyages bede states that theodore of tarsus greek was appointed archbishop of canterbury in and he taught greek
several english scholars and churchmen are described by bede as being fluent in greek due to being taught by him bede claims to be fluent in greek himself
frederick klaeber among others argued for connection between $beowulf$ and virgil near the start of the century claiming that the very act of writing secular epic in germanic world represents virgilian influence
virgil was seen as the pinnacle of latin literature and latin was the dominant literary language of england at the time therefore making virgilian influence highly likely
similarly in alistair campbell stated that the apologue technique used in $beowulf$ is so rare in epic poetry aside from virgil that the poet who composed $beowulf$ could not have written the poem in such manner without first coming across virgil writings
it cannot be denied that biblical parallels occur in the #text# whether seen as pagan work with christian colouring added by scribes or as christian historical novel with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as local colour as margaret goldsmith did in the christian theme of $beowulf$
in its inclusion of references to the genesis creation narrative the story of cain and abel noah and the flood the devil hell and the last judgment
the poem mixes the west saxon and anglian dialects of old english though it predominantly uses west saxon as do other old english poems copied at the time
it is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that $beowulf$ has endured long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas
there is wide array of linguistic forms in the $beowulf$ manuscript the poem retains complicated mix of the following dialectical forms mercian northumbrian early west saxon kentish and late west saxon
there are in $beowulf$ more than distinct words and almost occur exclusively or almost exclusively in this poem and in the other poetical texts
there are in round numbers three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in $beowulf$ and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings
one hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ge reckoning few found only in the past participle but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs and the prefix is employed to render shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest anglo saxon period
seven hundred of them including those formed with prefixes of which fifty or considerably more than half have ge are simple nouns at the highest reckoning not more than one quarter is absent in prose
that this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the norman conquest
considerably more than one third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use an old english poem such as $beowulf$ is very different from modern poetry
anglo saxon poets typically used alliterative verse form of verse in which the first half of the line the a verse is linked to the second half the verse through similarity in initial sound
in addition the two halves are divided by caesura oft scyld scefing sceaþena þreatum this verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions
the first one cited has three oft scyld scefing with ictus on the suffix ing whereas the second has two sceaþena þreatum
there is no fixed number of beats per line the poet has choice of epithets or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration
when speaking or reading old english poetry it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in modern english
the letter for example is always pronounced hroðgar as in the word edge both and vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment
between vowels or voiced consonants they are voiced sounding like modern and respectively otherwise they are unvoiced like modern in fat and in sat
some letters which are no longer found in modern english such as thorn and eth representing both pronunciations of modern english th as in thing
the voicing of these characters echoes that of and both are voiced as in this between other voiced sounds oðer laþleas suþern
and this are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern english editions otherwise they are unvoiced as in thing þunor suð soþfæst
kennings are also significant technique in $beowulf$ they are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre
for example poet might call the sea the swan road or the whale road king might be called ring giver
there are many kennings in $beowulf$ and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in old english which is heavily formulaic
the monsters and the critics that the poem is not an epic and while no conventional term exactly fits the nearest would be elegy
the history of modern $beowulf$ criticism is often said to begin with r tolkien author and merton professor of anglo saxon at university of oxford who in his lecture to the british academy criticised his contemporaries excessive interest in its historical implications
in historical terms the poem characters would have been norse pagans the historical events of the poem took #place# before the christianisation of scandinavia yet the poem was recorded by christian anglo saxons who had mostly converted from their native anglo saxon paganism around the century both anglo saxon paganism and norse paganism share common origin as both are forms of germanic paganism
$beowulf$ thus depicts germanic warrior society in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance
in terms of the relationship between characters in $beowulf$ to god one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work
literary critics such as fred robinson argue that the $beowulf$ poet arguably tries to send message to readers during the anglo saxon time period regarding the state of christianity in their own time
robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the anglo saxon period inherently shape the way in which the poet alludes to paganism as presented in $beowulf$
the poem also makes extensive use of elided metaphors r tolkien argued in $beowulf$ the poet arguably calls on anglo saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed christian lifestyles
in terms of the characters of the epic itself robinson argues that readers are impressed by the courageous acts of $beowulf$ and the speeches of $son_of_hrothgar$
but one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed christian truth
the relationship between the characters of $beowulf$ and the overall message of the poet regarding their relationship with god is largely debated among readers and literary critics alike
at the same time richard north argues that the $beowulf$ poet interpreted danish myths in christian form as the poem would have served as form of entertainment for christian audience and states as yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of $beowulf$ liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned
in other words the poet is referencing their anglo saxon heathenism this question is pressing given that anglo saxons saw the danes as heathens rather than as foreigners
other scholars disagree however as to the meaning and nature of the poem is it christian work set in germanic pagan context
the question suggests that the conversion from the germanic pagan beliefs to christian ones was prolonged and gradual process over several centuries and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written
robert yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions the only biblical references in $beowulf$ are to the old testament and christ is never mentioned
$grendel$ mother and $grendel$ are described as descendants of cain fact which some scholars link to the cain tradition the poem is set in pagan times and none of the characters is demonstrably christian
in fact when we are told what anyone in the poem believes we learn that they are pagans $beowulf$ own beliefs are not expressed explicitly
he offers eloquent prayers to higher power addressing himself to the father almighty or the wielder of all were those the prayers of pagan who used phrases the christians subsequently appropriated
or did the poem author intend to see $beowulf$ as christian ur #hero# symbolically refulgent with christian virtues the location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed
moorman the first professor of english language at university of leeds claimed that $beowulf$ was composed in yorkshire but talbot donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago during the first half of the eighth century and that the writer was native of what was then called west mercia located in the western midlands of england
however the late tenth century manuscript which alone preserves the poem originated in the kingdom of the west saxons as it is more commonly known
stanley greenfield has suggested that references to the human #body# throughout $beowulf$ emphasise the relative position of thanes to their lord
he argues that the term shoulder companion could refer to both physical arm as well as thane aeschere who was very valuable to his lord $son_of_hrothgar$
donaldson wrote that the poet who put the materials into their present form was christian and poem reflects christian tradition with aeschere death $son_of_hrothgar$ turns to $beowulf$ as his new arm
also greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect only appearing four times in the poem it is used in conjunction with unferð a man described by $beowulf$ as weak traitorous and cowardly
unferð is also member of the foot troops who throughout the story do nothing and generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action
daniel podgorski has argued that the work is best understood as an examination of inter generational vengeance based conflict or feuding
in this context the poem operates as an indictment of feuding conflicts as function of its conspicuous circuitous and lengthy depiction of the geatish swedish wars coming into contrast with the poem depiction of the protagonist $beowulf$ as being disassociated from the ongoing feuds in every way
greenfield notes that unferð is described as at the king feet line david woodard appears as both $beowulf$ and $grendel$ in the stage production exploding $beowulf$ berlin
