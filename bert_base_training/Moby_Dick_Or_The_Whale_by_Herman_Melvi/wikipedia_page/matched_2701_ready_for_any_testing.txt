sailor ishmael narrative of the obsessive quest of ahab captain of the whaling ship pequod for revenge on moby dick the giant white sperm whale that on the ship previous voyage bit off ahab leg at the knee
the book is a contribution to the literature of the american renaissance the work genre classifications range from late romantic to early symbolist
moby dick was published to mixed reviews was commercial failure and was out of print at the time of the author death in
william faulkner confessed he wished he had written the book himself and h lawrence called it one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world and the greatest book of the sea ever written
its reputation as great american novel was established only in the century after the centennial of its author birth its opening sentence call me ishmael is among world literature most famous
melville began writing moby dick in february and would eventually take months to write the book full year more than he had first anticipated
writing was interrupted by his making the acquaintance of nathaniel hawthorne in august and by the creation of the mosses from an old manse essay as first result of that friendship
the book is dedicated to hawthorne in token of my admiration for his genius the basis for the work is melville whaling voyage aboard the acushnet
the white whale is modeled on the notoriously hard to catch albino whale mocha dick and the book ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship essex in
the detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil as well as life aboard ship among culturally diverse crew are mixed with exploration of class and social status good and evil and the existence of god
in addition to narrative prose melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs poetry and catalogs to shakespearean stage directions soliloquies and asides
the novel also draws on whaling literature and on literary inspirations such as shakespeare and the bible in october the chapter the town ho story was published in harper new monthly magazine
the same month the whole book was first published in three volumes as the whale in london and under its definitive title in single volume edition in new york in november
the london publisher richard bentley censored or changed sensitive passages melville made revisions as well including last minute change to the title for the new york edition
there are hundreds of differences between the two editions most slight but some important and illuminating the whale however appears in the text of both editions as moby dick without the hyphen
one factor that led british reviewers to scorn the book was that it seemed to be told by narrator who perished with the ship the british edition lacked the epilogue which recounts ishmael survival
about copies were sold during the author life melville revisions and british editorial revisions see also list of moby dick characters
ishmael travels in december from manhattan island to new bedford massachusetts with plans to sign up for whaling voyage the inn where he arrives is overcrowded so he must share bed with the tattooed cannibal polynesian queequeg
harpooneer whose father was king of the fictional island of rokovoko the next morning ishmael and queequeg attend father mapple sermon on jonah then head for nantucket
ishmael signs up with the quaker ship owners bildad and peleg for voyage on their whaler pequod peleg describes captain ahab
he grand ungodly god like man who nevertheless has his humanities they hire queequeg the following morning a man named elijah prophesies dire fate should ishmael and queequeg join ahab
while provisions are loaded shadowy figures board the ship on cold christmas day the pequod leaves the harbor ishmael discusses cetology the zoological classification and natural history of the whale and describes the crew members
the chief mate is year old mr_starbuck nantucket quaker with realist mentality whose harpooneer is queequeg second mate is mr_stubb from cape cod happy go lucky and cheerful whose harpooneer is tashtego proud pure blooded indian from gay head and the third mate is flask also from martha vineyard short stout whose harpooneer is daggoo tall african now resident of nantucket
when ahab finally appears on the quarterdeck he announces he is out for revenge on the white whale which took one leg from the knee down and left him with prosthesis fashioned from whale jawbone
ahab will give the first man to sight moby dick doubloon gold coin which he nails to the mast mr_starbuck objects that he has not come for vengeance but for profit
ahab purpose exercises mysterious spell on ishmael ahab quenchless feud seemed mine instead of rounding cape horn ahab heads for the equatorial pacific ocean via southern africa
one afternoon as ishmael and queequeg are weaving mat its warp seemed necessity his hand free will and queequeg sword chance tashtego sights sperm whale
five previously unknown men appear on deck and are revealed to be special crew selected by ahab and explain the shadowy figures seen boarding the ship
southeast of the cape of good hope the pequod makes the first of nine sea encounters or gams with other ships ahab hails the goney albatross to ask whether they have seen the white whale but the trumpet through which her captain tries to speak falls into the sea before he can answer
ishmael explains that because of ahab absorption with moby dick he sails on without the customary gam which defines as social meeting of two or more
their leader fedallah parsee is ahab harpooneer whale ships in which the two captains remain on one ship and the chief mates on the other
in the second gam off the cape of good hope with the town ho nantucket whaler the concealed story of judgment of god is revealed but only to the crew defiant sailor who struck an oppressive officer is flogged and when that officer led the chase for moby dick he fell from the boat and was killed by the whale
ishmael digresses on pictures of whales brit microscopic sea creatures on which whales feed squid and after four boats lowered in vain because daggoo mistook giant squid for the white whale whale lines
the next day in the indian ocean mr_stubb kills sperm whale and that night fleece the pequod black cook prepares him rare whale steak
fleece at mr_stubb request delivers sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale carcass tied to the ship saying that their nature is to be voracious but they must overcome it
the whale is prepared beheaded and barrels of oil are tried out standing at the head of the whale ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea
the pequod next encounters the jeroboam which not only lost its chief mate to moby dick but also is now plagued by an epidemic
the whale carcass still lies in the water queequeg mounts it tied to ishmael belt by monkey rope as if they were siamese twins
ishmael compares the two heads in philosophical way the right whale is lockean stoic and the sperm whale as kantean platonic
mr_stubb and flask kill right whale whose head is fastened to yardarm opposite the sperm whale head tashtego cuts into the head of the sperm whale and retrieves buckets of oil
he falls into the head and the head falls off the yardarm into the sea queequeg dives after him and frees his mate with his sword
the pequod next gams with the jungfrau from bremen both ships sight whales simultaneously with the pequod winning the contest the three harpooneers dart their harpoons and flask delivers the mortal strike with lance
the pequod next gam is with the french whaler bouton de rose whose crew is ignorant of the ambergris in the gut of the diseased whale in their possession
day later an encounter with harpooned whale prompts pip little black cabin boy from connecticut to jump out of his whale boat
the carcass sinks and queequeg barely manages to escape mr_stubb talks them out of it but ahab orders him away the whale must be cut loose because the line has pip so entangled in it
furious mr_stubb orders pip to stay in the whale boat but pip later jumps again and is left alone in the immense sea and has gone insane by the time he is picked up
cooled sperm oil congeals and must be squeezed back into liquid state blubber is boiled in the try pots on deck the warm oil is decanted into casks and then stowed in the ship
the coin hammered to the main mast shows three andes summits one with flame one with tower and one crowing cock
ahab stops to look at the doubloon and interprets the coin as signs of his firmness volcanic energy and victory mr_starbuck takes the high peaks as evidence of the trinity mr_stubb focuses on the zodiacal arch over the mountains and flask sees nothing of any symbolic value at all
after the operation the decks are scrubbed the manxman mutters in front of the mast and pip declines the verb look
the pequod next gams with the samuel enderby of london captained by boomer down to earth fellow who lost his right arm to moby dick
nevertheless he carries no ill will toward the whale which he regards not as malicious but as awkward ahab puts an end to the gam by rushing back to his ship
the narrator now discusses the subjects of whalers supply glen in tranque in the arsacides islands full of carved whale bones fossil whales whale skeleton measurements the chance that the magnitude of the whale will diminish and that the leviathan might perish
leaving the samuel enderby ahab wrenches his ivory leg and orders the carpenter to fashion him another mr_starbuck informs ahab of oil leakage in the hold
reluctantly ahab orders the harpooneers to inspect the casks queequeg sweating all day below decks develops chill and soon is almost mortally feverish
queequeg tries it for size with pip sobbing and beating his tambourine standing by and calling himself coward while he praises queequeg for his gameness
the carpenter makes coffin for queequeg who fear an ordinary burial at sea yet queequeg suddenly rallies briefly convalesces and leaps up back in good health
henceforth he uses his coffin for spare seachest which is later caulked and pitched to replace the pequod life buoy the pequod sails northeast toward formosa and into the pacific ocean
ahab with one nostril smells the musk from the bashee isles and with the other the salt of the waters where moby dick swims
ahab goes to perth the blacksmith with bag of racehorse shoenail stubs to be forged into the shank of special harpoon and with his razors for perth to melt and fashion into harpoon barb
ahab tempers the barb in blood from queequeg tashtego and daggoo the pequod gams next with the bachelor nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil
on one of those nights in the whaleboat fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be ahab that before he dies ahab must see two hearses one not made by mortal hands and the other made of american wood that fedallah will precede his captain in death and finally that only hemp can kill ahab
as the pequod approaches the equator ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only where he is and not where he will be
every now and then the pequod lowers for whales with success he dashes it to the deck that evening an impressive typhoon attacks the ship
lightning strikes the mast setting the doubloon and ahab harpoon aglow ahab delivers speech on the spirit of fire seeing the lightning as portent of moby dick
next morning when he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass ahab makes new one out of lance maul and sailmaker needle
he orders the log be heaved but the weathered line snaps leaving the ship with no way to fix its location
mr_starbuck sees the lightning as warning and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping ahab with musket the pequod is now heading southeast toward moby dick
a man falls overboard from the mast the life buoy is thrown but both sink now queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin be used as new life buoy
mr_starbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and caulked next morning the ship meets in another truncated gam with the rachel commanded by captain gardiner from nantucket
the rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after moby dick among the missing is gardiner young son
ahab refuses to join the search twenty four hours day ahab now stands and walks the deck while fedallah shadows him
next the pequod in ninth and final gam meets the delight badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by moby dick
her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged but ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward
ahab speaks about his wife and child calls himself fool for spending years on whaling and claims he can see his own child in mr_starbuck eye
mr_starbuck tries to persuade ahab to return to nantucket to meet both their families but ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near fedallah
suddenly sea hawk grabs ahab slouched hat and flies off with it ahab shares moment of contemplation with mr_starbuck on the first day of the chase ahab smells the whale climbs the mast and sights moby dick
he claims the doubloon for himself and orders all boats to lower except for mr_starbuck the whale bites ahab boat in two tosses the captain out of it and scatters the crew
on the second day of the chase ahab leaves mr_starbuck in charge of the pequod moby dick smashes the three boats that seek him into splinters and tangles their lines
mr_starbuck begs ahab to desist but ahab vows to slay the white whale even if he would have to dive through the globe itself to get his revenge
ahab is rescued but his ivory leg and fedallah are lost on the third day of the chase ahab sights moby dick at noon and sharks appear as well
fedallah corpse still entangled in the fouled lines is lashed to the whale back so moby dick turns out to be the hearse fedallah prophesied
ahab lowers his boat for final time leaving mr_starbuck again on board moby dick breaches and destroys two boats possessed by all the fallen angels ahab plants his harpoon in the whale flank
he is left behind in the sea and so is the only crewman of the pequod to survive the final encounter
moby dick smites the whaleboat tossing its men into the sea only ishmael is unable to return to the boat the whale now fatally attacks the pequod
ahab then realizes that the destroyed ship is the hearse made of american wood in fedallah prophesy the whale returns to ahab who stabs at him again
in doing so the line loops around ahab neck and as the stricken whale swims away the captain is drawn with him out of sight
as he does so the line gets tangled and ahab bends over to free it queequeg coffin comes to the surface the only thing to escape the vortex when pequod sank
ishmael is the narrator shaping his story with use of many different genres including sermons stage plays soliloquies and emblematical readings
for an entire day ishmael floats on it until the rachel still looking for its lost seamen rescues him repeatedly ishmael refers to his writing of the book
but how can hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself must else all these chapters might be naught
bezanson first distinguishes ishmael as narrator from ishmael as character whom he calls forecastle ishmael and who is the younger ishmael of some years ago
scholar john bryant calls him the novel central consciousness and narrative voice narrator ishmael then is merely young ishmael grown older
second distinction avoids confusion of either of both ishmaels with the author herman melville bezanson warns readers to resist any one to one equation of melville and ishmael
the simplest sequences are of narrative progression then sequences of theme such as the three chapters on whale painting and sequences of structural similarity such as the five dramatic chapters beginning with the quarter deck or the four chapters beginning with the candles
according to critic walter bezanson the chapter structure can be divided into chapter sequences chapter clusters and balancing chapters chapter clusters are the chapters on the significance of the colour white and those on the meaning of fire
balancing chapters are chapters of opposites such as loomings versus the epilogue or similars such as the quarter deck and the candles
scholar lawrence buell describes the arrangement of the non narrative chapters as structured around three patterns first the nine meetings of the pequod with ships that have encountered moby dick
in the early encounters the whaleboats hardly make contact later there are false alarms and routine chases finally the massive assembling of whales at the edges of the china sea in the grand armada
each has been more and more severely damaged foreshadowing the pequod own fate second the increasingly impressive encounters with whales a typhoon near japan sets the stage for ahab confrontation with moby dick
these chapters start with the ancient history of whaling and bibliographical classification of whales getting closer with second hand stories of the evil of whales in general and of moby dick in particular chronologically ordered commentary on pictures of whales
the climax to this section is chapter of whales in paint etc which begins with the humble a beggar in london and ends with the sublime the constellation cetus
the next chapter brit thus the other half of this pattern begins with the book first description of live whales and next the anatomy of the sperm whale is studied more or less from front to rear and from outer to inner parts all the way down to the skeleton
the third pattern is the cetological documentation so lavish that it can be divided into two subpatterns two concluding chapters set forth the whale evolution as species and claim its eternal nature
some ten or more of the chapters on whale killings beginning at two fifths of the book are developed enough to be called events
as bezanson writes in each case killing provokes either chapter sequence or chapter cluster of cetological lore growing out of the circumstance of the particular killing thus these killings are structural occasions for ordering the whaling essays and sermons
buell observes that the narrative architecture is an idiosyncratic variant of the bipolar observer hero narrative that is the novel is structured around the two main characters ahab and ishmael who are intertwined and contrasted with each other with ishmael the observer and narrator
bryant and springer find that the book is structured around the two consciousnesses of ahab and ishmael with ahab as force of linearity and ishmael force of digression
while both have an angry sense of being orphaned they try to come to terms with this hole in their beings in different ways
and while the plot in moby dick may be driven by ahab anger ishmael desire to get hold of the ungraspable accounts for the novel lyricism
buell sees double quest in the book ahab is to hunt moby dick ishmael is to understand what to make of both whale and hunt
as the story of ishmael remarks robert milder it is narrative of education ahab with violence ishmael with meditation one of the most distinctive features of the book is the variety of genres
bezanson mentions sermons dreams travel account autobiography elizabethan plays and epic poetry he calls ishmael explanatory footnotes to establish the documentary genre a nabokovian touch
a significant structural device is the series of nine meetings gams between the pequod and other ships these meetings are important in three ways
first their placement in the narrative the initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other the central group of five gams are separated by about chapters more or less
this pattern provides structural element remarks bezanson as if the encounters were bones to the book flesh second ahab developing responses to the meetings plot the rising curve of his passion and of his monomania
third in contrast to ahab ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually each ship is scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads
instead they may be interpreted as a group of metaphysical parables series of biblical analogues masque of the situation confronting man pageant of the humors within men parade of the nations and so forth as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the white whale
bezanson sees no single way to account for the meaning of all of these ships scholar nathalia wright sees the meetings and the significance of the vessels along other lines
she singles out the four vessels which have already encountered moby dick the first the jeroboam is named after the predecessor of the biblical king ahab
her prophetic fate is a message of warning to all who follow articulated by gabriel and vindicated by the samuel enderby the rachel the delight and at last the pequod
none of the other ships has been completely destroyed because none of their captains shared ahab monomania the fate of the jeroboam reinforces the structural parallel between ahab and his biblical namesake
ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him
an early enthusiast for the melville revival british author m forster remarked in moby dick is full of meanings its meaning is different problem
yet he saw as the essential in the book its prophetic song which flows like an undercurrent beneath the surface action and morality
i kings biographer laurie robertson lorant sees epistemology as the book theme ishmael taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty
she also contrasts ishmael and ahab attitudes toward life with ishmael open minded and meditative polypositional stance as antithetical to ahab monomania adhering to dogmatic rigidity
melville biographer delbanco cites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences all races are represented among the crew members of the pequod
although ishmael initially is afraid of queequeg as tattooed cannibal he soon decides better sleep with sober cannibal than drunken christian
while it may be rare for mid century american book to feature black characters in nonslavery context slavery is frequently mentioned
when pip has almost drowned ahab genuinely touched by pip suffering questions him gently pip can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of fugitive slave pip
editors bryant and springer suggest perception is central theme the difficulty of seeing and understanding which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down
ahab explains that like all things the evil whale wears disguise all visible objects man are but pasteboard masks and ahab is determined to strike through the mask
the theme of race is primarily carried by pip the diminutive black cabin boy how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall
to me the white whale is that wall ch this theme pervades the novel perhaps never so emphatically as in the doubloon
ch where each crewmember perceives the coin in way shaped by his own personality later the american edition has ahab discover no sign ch of the whale when he is staring into the deep
in the british edition melville changed the word discover to perceive and with good reason for discovery means finding what is already there but perceiving or better still perception is a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it
the point is not that ahab would discover the whale as an object but that he would perceive it as symbol of his making
ishmael and queequeg sensual friendship initiates kind of racial harmony that is shattered when the crew dancing erupts into racial conflict in midnight forecastle ch
fifty chapters later pip suffers mental disintegration after he is reminded that as slave he would be worth less money than whale
in fact moby dick is then swimming up at him yet melville does not offer easy solutions commodified and brutalized pip becomes the ship conscience
in chapter ishmael expounds the concept of the fast fish and the loose fish which gives right of ownership to those who take possession of an abandoned fish or ship and observes that the british empire took possession of american indian lands in colonial times in just the way that whalers take possession of an unclaimed whale
the novel has also been read as being critical of the contemporary literary and philosophical movement transcendentalism attacking the thought of leading transcendentalist ralph waldo emerson in particular
the life and death of ahab has been read as an attack on emerson philosophy of self reliance for one in its destructive potential and potential justification for egoism
richard chase writes that for melville death spiritual emotional physical is the price of self reliance when it is pushed to the point of solipsism where the world has no existence apart from the all sufficient self
in that regard chase sees melville art as antithetical to that of emerson thought in that melville the vital possibilities of the self
his views of property are another example of wrestling with moral choice newton arvin further suggests that self reliance was for melville really the a wild egoism anarchic irresponsible and destructive
an incomplete inventory of the language of moby dick by editors bryant and springer includes nautical biblical homeric shakespearean miltonic cetological influences and his style is alliterative fanciful colloquial archaic and unceasingly allusive melville tests and exhausts the possibilities of grammar quotes from range of well known or obscure sources and swings from calm prose to high rhetoric technical exposition seaman slang mystic speculation or wild prophetic archaism
many words that make up the vocabulary of moby dick are melville own coinages critic newton arvin recognizes as if the english vocabulary were too limited for the complex things melville had to express
equally abundant are unfamiliar adjectives and adverbs including participial adjectives such as officered omnitooled and uncatastrophied participial adverbs such as intermixingly postponedly and uninterpenetratingly rarities such as the adjectives unsmoothable spermy and leviathanic and adverbs such as sultanically spanishly and venetianly and adjectival compounds ranging from odd to magnificent such as the message carrying air the circus running sun and teeth tiered sharks
it is rarer for melville to create his own verbs from nouns but he does this with what arvin calls irresistible effect such as in who didst thunder him higher than throne and my fingers began to serpentine and spiralize
for arvin the essence of the writing style of moby dick lies in the manner in which the parts of speech are intermixingly assorted in melville style so that the distinction between verbs and nouns substantives and modifiers becomes half unreal one this is the prime characteristic of his language
no feature of it could express more tellingly the awareness that lies below and behind moby dick the awareness that action and condition movement and stasis object and idea are but surface aspects of one underlying reality
perhaps the most striking example is the use of verbal nouns mostly plural such as allurings coincidings and leewardings arvin categories have been slightly expanded by later critics most notably warner berthoff
first the original modification of words as leviathanism and the exaggerated repetition of modified words as in the series pitiable pity pitied and piteous ch
the superabundant vocabulary of the work can be broken down into strategies used individually and in combination second the use of existing words in new ways as when the whale heaps and tasks
third words lifted from specialized fields as fossiliferous fourth the use of unusual adjective noun combinations as in concentrating brow and immaculate manliness
fifth using the participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader as the words preluding and foreshadowing so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene
responsible for this are both melville imitation of certain distinct styles and his habitual use of sources to shape his own work
ch in this foreshadowing interval characteristic stylistic elements of another kind are the echoes and overtones his three most important sources in order are the bible shakespeare and milton
another notable stylistic element are the several levels of rhetoric the simplest of which is a relatively straightforward expository style that is evident of many passages in the cetological chapters though they are rarely sustained and serve chiefly as transitions between more sophisticated levels
one of these is the poetic level of rhetoric which bezanson sees well exemplified in ahab quarter deck soliloquy to the point that it can be set as blank verse
set over metrical patern the rhythms are evenly controlled too evenly perhaps for prose bezanson suggests third level of rhetoric is the idiomatic and just as the poetic it hardly is present in pure form
examples of this are the consistently excellent idiom of mr_stubb such as in the way he encourages the rowing crew in rhythm of speech that suggests the beat of the oars takes the place of the metronomic meter
the fourth and final level of rhetoric is the composite a magnificent blending of the first three and possible other elements the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation
there is his home there lies his buisiness which noah flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china
he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps
for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman
with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales
similar great passages include the marvelous hymn to spiritual democracy that can be found in the middle of knights and squires
the elaborate use of the homeric simile may not have been learned from homer himself yet matthiessen finds the writing more consistently alive on the homeric than on the shakespearean level especially during the final chase the controlled accumulation of such similes emphasizes ahab hubris through succession of land images for instance the ship tore on leaving such furrow in the sea as when cannon ball missent becomes ploughshare and turns up the level field the chase second day ch
one paragraph long simile describes how the men of the crew became single unit for as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting things oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of the crew this man valor that man fear guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to
the final phrase fuses the two halves of the comparison the men become identical with the ship which follows ahab direction
the concentration only gives way to more imagery with the mastheads like the tops of tall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs
this passage from chapter that bezanson calls comical prose poem blends high and low with relaxed assurance all these images contribute their startling energy to the advance of the narrative
these similes with their astonishing imaginative abundance are not only invaluable in creating the dramatic movement matthiessen observes they are no less notable for breadth and the more sustained among them for an heroic dignity
the influence of shakespeare on the book has been analyzed by o matthiessen in his study of the american renaissance with such results that almost half century later bezanson still considered him the richest critic on these matters
according to matthiesen then melville possession by shakespeare went far beyond all other influences in that it made melville discover his own full strength through the challenge of the most abundant imagination in history
when the boats are lowered the imagery serves to dwarf everything but ahab will in the presence of moby dick especially the influence of king lear and macbeth has attracted scholarly attention
matthiessen points out that the mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing at the end of cetology ch echo the famous phrase in macbeth
on almost every page debts to shakespeare can be discovered whether hard or easy to recognize told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
as matthiessen demonstrates ahab first extended speech to the crew in the quarter deck ch is virtually blank verse and can be printed as such
but look ye mr_starbuck what is said in heat from whom warm words are small indignity i mean not to incense thee
see yonder turkish cheeks of spotted tawn living breathing pictures painted by the sun unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reason for the torrid life they feel
reading shakespeare matthiessen observes had been a catalytic agent for melville one that transformed his writing from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces
the extent to which melville was in full possession of his powers is demonstrated by matthiessen through the description of ahab which ends in language that suggests shakespeare but is not an imitation of it oh ahab
what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air
the imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly shakespearean but its two key words appear only once each in the plays and to neither of these usages is melville indebted for his fresh combination
melville assimilation of shakespeare matthiessen concludes gave moby dick a kind of diction that depended upon no source and that could as h lawrence put it convey something almost superhuman or inhuman bigger than life
most importantly through shakespeare melville infused moby dick with power of expression he had not previously possessed the prose is not based on anybody else verse but on a sense of speech rhythm
in addition to this sense of rhythm melville acquired verbal resources which for matthiessen showed that he now mastered shakespeare mature secret of how to make language itself dramatic
he had learned three essential things matthiessen sums up to rely on verbs of action which lend their dynamic pressure to both movement and meaning
the effective tension caused by the contrast of thou launchest navies of full freighted world and there that in here that still remains indifferent in the candles ch makes the last clause lead to compulsion to strike the breast which suggests how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words the shakespearean energy of verbal compounds was not lost on him full freighted and finally melville learned how to handle the quickened sense of life that comes from making one part of speech act as another for example earthquake as an adjective or the coining of placeless an adjective from noun
the creation of ahab melville biographer leon howard discovered followed an observation by coleridge in his lecture on hamlet one of shakespeare modes of creating characters is to conceive any one intellectual or moral faculty in morbid excess and then to place himself
ahab seemed to have what seems half wilful over ruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature and all men tragically great melville added are made so through certain morbidness all mortal greatness is but disease
in addition to this in howard view the self references of ishmael as tragic dramatist and his defense of his choice of hero who lacked all outward majestical trappings is evidence that melville consciously thought of his protagonist as tragic hero of the sort found in hamlet and king lear
moby dick is based on melville experience on the whaler acushnet however even the book most factual accounts of whaling are not straight autobiography
thus mutilated or diseased under given circumstances coleridge vocabulary is echoed in some phrases that describe ahab on december he signed on as green hand for the maiden voyage of the acushnet planned to last for months
its owner melvin bradford resembled bildad who signed on ishmael in that he was quaker on several instances when he signed documents he erased the word swear and replaced it with affirm
but the shareholders of the acushnet were relatively wealthy whereas the owners of the pequod included poor widows and orphaned children
although men signed up as crew members two did not show up for the ship departure and were replaced by one new crew member
its captain was valentine pease jr who was years old at the start of the voyage the crew was not as heterogenous or exotic as the crew of the pequod
five of the crew were foreigners four of them portuguese and the others were american either at birth or naturalized three black men were in the crew two seamen and the cook
fleece the cook of the pequod was also black so probably modeled on this philadelphia born william maiden who was years old when he signed for the acushnet
only of the original crew members completed the voyage the others either deserted or were regularly discharged the first officer frederic raymond left the ship after fight with the captain
first mate actually called edward mr_starbuck was on an earlier voyage with captain pease in the early and was discharged at tahiti under mysterious circumstances
he is identified as mr_stubb in an annotation in the book copy of crew member henry hubbard who like melville had joined the voyage as green hand
the second mate on the acushnet was john hall english born but naturalized american hubbard also identified the model for pip john backus little black man added to the crew during the voyage
hubbard annotation appears in the chapter the castaway and reveals that pip falling into the water was authentic hubbard was with him in the same boat when the incident occurred
ahab seems to have had no model in real life though his death may have been based on an actual event
aboard were two sailors from the nantucket who could have told him that they had seen their second mate taken out of whaleboat by foul line and drowned
on may melville was aboard the star which sailed for honolulu the model for the whaleman chapel of chapter is the seamen bethel on johnny cake hill
melville attended service there shortly before he shipped out on the acushnet and he heard sermon by the chaplain year old reverend enoch mudge who is at least in part the model for father mapple
even the topic of jonah and the whale may be authentic for mudge was contributor to sailor magazine which printed in december the ninth of series of sermons on jonah
in addition to his own experience on the whaling ship acushnet two actual events served as the genesis for melville tale
one was the sinking of the nantucket ship essex in after sperm whale rammed her miles km from the western coast of south america
first mate owen chase one of eight survivors recorded the events in his narrative of the most extraordinary and distressing shipwreck of the whale ship essex
the other event was the alleged killing in the late of the albino sperm whale mocha dick in the waters off the chilean island of mocha
mocha dick was rumored to have or so harpoons in his back from other whalers and appeared to attack ships with premeditated ferocity
one of his battles with whaler served as subject for an article by explorer jeremiah reynolds in the may issue of the knickerbocker or new york monthly magazine
from the effect of age or more probably from freak of nature a singular consequence had resulted he was white as wool
melville copy of natural history of the sperm whale significantly reynolds writes first person narration that serves as frame for the story of whaling captain he meets
the captain resembles ahab and suggests similar symbolism and single minded motivation in hunting this whale in that when his crew first encounters mocha dick and cowers from him the captain rallies them as he drew near with his long curved back looming occasionally above the surface of the billows we perceived that it was white as the surf around him and the men stared aghast at each other as they uttered in suppressed tone the terrible name of mocha dick
mocha dick or the l said i this boat never sheers off from any thing that wears the shape of whale
mocha dick had over encounters with whalers in the decades between and the he was described as being gigantic and covered in barnacles
although he was the most famous mocha dick was not the only white whale in the sea nor the only whale to attack hunters
while an accidental collision with sperm whale at night accounted for sinking of the union in it was not until august that the whaler ann alexander while hunting in the pacific off the galápagos islands became the second vessel since the essex to be attacked holed and sunk by whale
what commentator is this ann alexander whale what he has to say is short pithy very much to the point i wonder if my evil art has raised this monster
while melville had already drawn on his different sailing experiences in his previous novels such as mardi he had never focused specifically on whaling
the months he spent as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler acushnet in and one incident in particular now served as inspiration
melville later wrote questioned him concerning his father adventure he went to his chest handed me complete copy of the narrative
during mid ocean gam rendezvous at sea between ships he met chase son william who lent him his father book this was the first printed account of it had ever seen
the reading of this wondrous story on the landless sea and so close to the very latitude of the shipwreck had surprising effect upon me
melville let his interest in the book be known to his father in law lemuel shaw whose friend in nantucket procured an imperfect but clean copy which shaw gave to melville in april
melville read this copy avidly made copious notes in it and had it bound keeping it in his library for the rest of his life
moby dick contains large sections most of them narrated by ishmael that seemingly have nothing to do with the plot but describe aspects of the whaling business
although successful earlier novel about nantucket whalers had been written miriam coffin or the whale fisherman by joseph hart which is credited with influencing elements of melville work most accounts of whaling tended to be sensational tales of bloody mutiny and melville believed that no book up to that time had portrayed the whaling industry in as fascinating or immediate way as he had experienced it
melville found the bulk of his data on whales and whaling in five books the most important of which was by the english ship surgeon thomas beale natural history of the sperm whale a book of reputed authority which melville bought on july
to the composition of moby dick surpasses that of any other source book from which melville is known to have drawn
according to scholar howard vincent the general influence of this source is to supply the arrangement of whaling data in chapter groupings
melville followed beale grouping closely yet adapted it to what art demanded and he changed the original prosaic phrases into graphic figures of speech
the second most important whaling book is frederick debell bennett whaling voyage round the globe from the year to from which melville also took the chapter organization but in lesser degree than he learned from beale
the third book was the one melville reviewed for the literary world in ross browne etchings of whaling cruise which may have given melville the first thought for whaling book and in any case contains passages embarrassingly similar to passages in moby dick
the whale and his captors was used for two episodes in moby dick but probably appeared too late in the writing of the novel to be of much more use
melville did plunder fifth book william scoresby jr an account of the arctic regions with history and description of the northern whale fishery though
the book was out of print and rare the fourth book reverend henryt cheever unlike the other four books its subject is the greenland whale rather than the sperm whale
although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication melville satirized and parodied it on several occasions for instance in the description of narwhales in the chapter cetology where he called scoresby charley coffin and gave his account a humorous twist of fact scoresby will help out melville several times and on each occasion melville will satirize him under pseudonym
vincent suggests several reasons for melville attitude towards scoresby including his dryness and abundance of irrelevant data but the major reason seems to have been that the greenland whale was the sperm whale closest competitor for the public attention so melville felt obliged to dismiss anything dealing with it
the earliest surviving mention of the composition of what became moby dick is the final paragraph of the letter melville wrote to richard henry dana jr on may
about the whaling voyage i am half way in the work am very glad that your suggestion so jumps with mine
it will be strange sort of book tho fear blubber is blubber you know tho you may get oil out of it the poetry runs as hard as sap from frozen maple tree to cook the thing up one must needs throw in little fancy which from the nature of the thing must be ungainly as the gambols of the whales themselves
yet mean to give the truth of the thing spite of this some scholars have concluded that melville composed moby dick in two or even three stages
reasoning from series of inconsistencies and structural developments in the final version they hypothesize that the work he mentioned to dana was in the words of lawrence buell relatively straightforward whaling adventure but that reading shakespeare and his encounters with hawthorne inspired him to rewrite it as an epic of cosmic encyclopedic proportions
bezanson objects that the letter contains too many ambiguities to assume that dana uggestion would obviously be that melville do for whaling what he had done for life on man of war in white jacket
in addition dana had experienced how incomparable melville was in dramatic story telling when he met him in boston so perhaps his uggestion was that melville do book that captured that gift
and the long sentence in the middle of the above quotation simply acknowledges that melville is struggling with the problem not of choosing between fact and fancy but of how to interrelate them
the most positive statements are that it will be strange sort of book and that melville means to give the truth of the thing but what thing exactly is not clear
considering his elaborate use of sources it is safe to say that they helped him shape the narrative its plot included
scholars john bryant and haskell springer cite the development of the character ishmael as another factor which prolonged melville process of composition and which can be deduced from the structure of the final version of the book
ishmael in the early chapters is simply the narrator just as the narrators in melville earlier sea adventures had been but in later chapters becomes mystical stage manager who is central to the tragedy
less than two months after mentioning the project to dana melville reported in letter of june to richard bentley his english publisher
my dear sir in the latter part of the coming autumn shall have ready new work and write you now to propose its publication in england
the book is romance of adventure founded upon certain wild legends in the southern sperm whale fisheries and illustrated by the author own personal experience of two years more as harpooneer
melville may have found the plot before writing or developed it after the writing process was underway nathaniel hawthorne and his family had moved to small red farmhouse near lenox massachusetts at the end of march
he became friends with oliver wendell holmes sr and melville beginning on august when the authors met at picnic hosted by mutual friend
melville wrote an unsigned review of hawthorne short story collection mosses from an old manse titled hawthorne and his mosses which appeared in the literary world on august and
bezanson finds the essay so deeply related to melville imaginative and intellectual world while writing moby dick that it could be regarded as virtual preface and should be everybody prime piece of contextual reading
in the essay melville compares hawthorne to shakespeare and dante and his self projection is evident in the repeats of the word genius the more than two dozen references to shakespeare and in the insistence that shakespeare unapproachability is nonsense for an american
the most intense work on the book was done during the winter of when melville had changed the noise of new york city for farm in pittsfield massachusetts
arrowhead the house in pittsfield massachusetts in which melville worked on moby dick the move may well have delayed finishing the book
during these months he wrote several excited letter to hawthorne including one of june in which he summarizes his career what feel most moved to write that is banned it will not pay
yet altogether write the other way cannot so the product is final hash and all my books are botches this is the stubborn melville who stood by mardi and talked about his other more commercial books with contempt
the letter also reveals how melville experienced his development from his year three weeks have scarcely passed at any time between then and now that have not unfolded within myself
but feel that am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould
one other theory holds that getting to know hawthorne first inspired him to write ahab tragic obsession into the book but bryant and springer object that melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination such as the bible jonah and job milton satan shakespeare king lear byron heroes
theories of the composition of the book have been harpooned in three ways first by raising objections against the use of evidence and the evidence itself
john bryant finds little concrete evidence and nothing at all conclusive to show that melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book
scholar robert milder sees insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology at work second type of objection is based upon melville intellectual development
bezanson is not convinced that before he met hawthorne melville was not ready for the kind of book moby dick became because in his letter from the time melville denounces his last two straight narratives redburn and white jacket as two books written just for the money and he firmly stood by mardi as the kind of book he believed in
his language is already richly steeped in century mannerisms characteristics of moby dick a third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence
according to milder the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters can bear intimate thematic relation to symbolic story not yet conceived
buell finds that theories based on combination of selected passages from letter and what are perceived as loose ends in the book not only tend to dissolve into guesswork but he also suggests that these so called loose ends may be intended by the author repeatedly the book mentions the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors
despite all this buell finds the evidence that melville changed his ambitions during writing on the whole convincing melville first proposed the english publication in june letter to richard bentley london publisher of his earlier works
textual scholar thomas tanselle explains that for these earlier books american proof sheets had been sent to the english publisher and that publication in the united states had been held off until the work had been set in type and published in england
in the case of moby dick melville had taken almost year longer than promised and could not rely on harpers to prepare the proofs as they had done for the earlier books
indeed harpers had denied him an advance and since he was already in debt to them for almost he was forced to borrow money and to arrange for the typesetting and plating himself
john bryant suggests that he did so to reduce the number of hands playing with his text the final stages of composition overlapped with the early stages of publication
in june melville wrote to hawthorne that he was in new york to work and slave on my whale while it is driving through the press
by the end of the month wearied with the long delay of printers melville came back to finish work on the book in pittsfield
three weeks later the typesetting was almost done as he announced to bentley on july i am now passing thro the press the closing sheets of my new work
while melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set the corrected proof would be plated that is the type fixed in final form
since earlier chapters were already plated when he was revising the later ones melville must have felt restricted in the kinds of revisions that were feasible
on july bentley offered melville and half profits that is half the profits that remained after the expenses of production and advertising
melville signed and returned the contract in early september and then went to new york with the proof sheets made from the finished plates which he sent to london by his brother allan on september
for over month these proofs had been in melville possession and because the book would be set anew in england he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them
he still had no american publisher so the usual hurry about getting the english publication to precede the american was not present
on july melville accepted after which bentley drew up contract on august only on september was the harper publishing contract signed
bentley received the proof sheets with melville corrections and revisions marked on them on september he published the book less than four weeks later
in the october issue of harper new monthly magazine the town ho story was published with footnote reading from the whale
the title of new work by mr melville in the press of harper and brothers and now publishing in london by mr on october the english edition the whale was published in printing of only copies fewer than melville previous books
their slow sales had convinced bentley that smaller number was more realistic the london morning herald on october printed the earliest known review
on november the american edition moby dick was published and the same day reviewed in both the albany argus and the morning courier and new york enquirer
the first american printing of copies was almost the same as the first of mardi but the first printing of melville other three harper books had been thousand copies more
the english edition set by bentley printers from the american page proofs with melville revisions and corrections differs from the american edition in over wordings and thousands of punctuation and spelling changes
excluding the preliminaries and the one extract the three volumes of the english edition came to pages and the single american volume to pages
accordingly the dedication to hawthorne in the american edition this book is inscribed to became these volumes are inscribed to in the english
the table of contents in the english edition generally follows the actual chapter titles in the american edition but titles in the american table of contents differ from the titles above the chapters themselves
this list was probably drawn up by melville himself the titles of chapters describing encounters of the pequod with other ships had apparently to stress the parallelisms between these chapters
melville revisions and british editorial revisions been standardized to the pequod meets the with the exception of the already published the town ho story
an epigraph from paradise lost taken from the second of the two quotations from that work in the american edition appears on the title page of each of the three english volumes
melville involvement with this rearrangement is not clear if it was bentley gesture toward accommodating melville as tanselle suggests its selection put an emphasis on the quotation melville may not have agreed with
the largest of melville revisions is the addition to the english edition of word footnote in chapter explaining the word gally
for unknown reasons the etymology and extracts were moved to the end of the third volume the edition also contains six short phrases and some single words lacking in the american edition
in addition about changes produce genuine improvements as opposed to mere corrections melville may not have made every one of the changes in this category but it seems certain that he was responsible for the great majority of them
the british publisher hired one or more revisers who were in the evaluation of scholar steven olsen smith responsible for unauthorized changes ranging from typographical errors and omissions to acts of outright censorship
the expurgations fall into four categories ranked according to the apparent priorities of the censor sacrilegious passages more than words attributing human failures to god was grounds for excision or revision as was comparing human shortcomings to divine ones
for example in chapter ahab ahab stands with a crucifixion in his face was revised to an apparently eternal anguish sexual matters including the sex life of whales and even ishmael worried anticipation of the nature of queequeg underwear as well as allusion to fornication or harlots and our hearts honeymoon in relation to ishmael and queequeg chapter however the cassock referring to the whale genital organ was untouched perhaps because of melville indirect language
according to biographer robertson lorant the result was that the english edition was badly mutilated remarks belittling royalty or implying criticism of the british
this meant the exclusion of the complete chapter a postscript on the use of sperm oil at coronations perceived grammatical or stylistic anomalies were treated with a highly conservative interpretation of rules of correctness
the final difference in the material not already plated is that the epilogue thus ishmael miraculous survival is omitted from the british edition
obviously the epilogue was not an afterthought supplied too late for the english edition for it is referred to in the castaway in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself
these expurgations also meant that any corrections or revisions melville may have marked upon these passages are now lost why the epilogue is missing is unknown
since nothing objectionable was in it most likely it was somehow lost by bentley printer when the etymology and extracts were moved
probably late in september allan sent bentley two pages of proof with letter of which only draft survives which informed him that melville has determined upon new title dedication
after the sheets had been sent melville changed the title enclosed you have proof of both it is thought here that the new title will be better selling title
after expressing his hope that bentley would receive this change in time allan said that moby dick is legitimate title for the book being the name given to particular whale who if may so express myself is the hero of the volume
biographer hershel parker suggests that the reason for the change was that harper had two years earlier published book with similar title the whale and his captors
changing the title was not problem for the american edition since the running heads throughout the book only showed the titles of the chapters and the title page which would include the publisher name could not be printed until publisher was found
the title of new work by mr shows that at this point after the publisher had been found the original title still stood
when allan letter arrived no sooner than early october bentley had already announced the whale in both the athenaem and the spectator of and october
probably to accommodate melville bentley inserted half title page in the first volume only which reads the whale or moby dick
in october harper new monthly magazine printed chapter the town ho story with footnote saying from the whale the british printing of copies sold fewer than within the first four months
in some remaining sheets were bound in cheaper casing and in enough sheets were still left to issue cheap edition in one volume
bentley recovered only half on the he advanced melville whose share from actual sales would have been just and he did not print new edition
harper first printing was copies including the standard review copies the selling price was about fifth of the price of the british three volume edition
after three years the first edition was still available almost copies of which were lost when fire broke out at the firm in december
in a second printing of copies was issued in a third of copies and finally in a fourth printing of copies which sold so slowly that no new printing was ordered
moby dick was out of print during the last four years of melville life having sold in its first year and half and on average copies year for the next years totaling copies
melville earnings from the book add up to the advance from bentley was equivalent to and the american printings earned him which was less than he earned from any of his five previous books
about copies were sold within day and then sales slowed down to less than the next year melville widow received another when the united states book company issued the book and sold almost copies between and
the reception of the whale in britain and of moby dick in the united states differed in two ways according to parker
first british literary criticism was more sophisticated and developed than in the still young republic with british reviewing done by cadres of brilliant literary people while the united states had only a handful of reviewers capable enough to be called critics and american editors and reviewers habitually echoed british opinion
american reviewing was mostly delegated to newspaper staffers or else by amateur contributors more noted for religious piety than critical acumen
second the differences between the two editions caused two distinct critical receptions twenty one reviews appeared in london and later one in dublin
the morning advertiser for october was in awe of melville learning of his dramatic ability for producing prose poem and of the whale adventures which were powerful in their cumulated horrors
to its surprise john bull found philosophy in whales and poetry in blubber and concluded that few books that claimed to be either philosophical or literary works contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as the tale of the pequod whaling expedition making it work far beyond the level of an ordinary work of fiction
the morning post found it one of the cleverest wittiest and most amusing of modern books and predicted that it was book which will do great things for the literary reputation of its author
melville himself never saw these reviews and parker calls it bitter irony that the reception overseas was all he could possibly have hoped for short of few conspicuous proclamations that the distance between him and shakespeare was by no means immeasurable
one of the earliest reviews by the extremely conservative critic henry chorleyn ill compounded mixture of romance and matter of fact
the idea of connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition
the style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad rather than bad english and its catastrophe is hastily weakly and obscurely managed
according to the london literary gazette and journal of science and art for december mr melville cannot do without savages so he makes half of his dramatis personae wild indians malays and other untamed humanities who appeared in an odd book professing to be novel wantonly eccentric outrageously bombastic in places charmingly and vividly descriptive
most critics regretted the extravagant digressions because they distracted from an otherwise interesting and even exciting narrative but even critics who did not like the book as whole recognized the genius evident in melville originality of imagination and expression
one problem was that since the english edition omitted the epilogue british reviewers read book with first person narrator who apparently did not survive to tell the tale
the reviewer of the literary gazette asked how ishmael who appears to have been drowned with the rest communicated his notes to mr the reviewer in the spectator objected that nothing should be introduced into novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known thus he must not describe the conversation of miners in pit if they all perish
the dublin university magazine asked how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story and the literary gazette declared that how the writer who appears to have been drowned with the rest communicated his notes for publication to mr bentley is not explained
few other reviewers who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of ishmael telling the story pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages
the british reviewers according to parker mostly regarded the whale as a phenomenal literary work philosophical metaphysical and poetic romance other reviewers were fascinated enough with the book to accept its perceived flaws
john bull praised the author for making literature out of unlikely and even unattractive matter and the morning post found that delight far oustripped the improbable character of events
though some reviewers viewed the characters especially ahab as exaggerated many understood it took an extraordinary character to undertake the battle with the white whale
melville style was usually praised regardless of the reviewer judgment of the book but some perceived the same tendency to over doing here and some found his style too american
some sixty reviews appeared in america the criterion for counting as review being more than two lines of comment only couple of reviewers expressed themselves early enough not to be influenced by news of the british reception
the earliest american review in the boston post for november quoted the london athenaeum scornful review not realizing that some of the criticism of the whale did not pertain to moby dick
this last point and the authority and influence of british criticism in american reviewing is clear from the review opening we have read nearly one half of this book and are satisfied that the london athenaeum is right in calling it an ill compounded mixture of romance and matter of fact
though the post quoted the greater portion of the review it omitted the condensed extract of melville prose the athenaeum had included to give readers an example of it
the post deemed the price of one dollar and fifty cents far too much the whale is not worth the money asked for it either as literary work or as mass of printed paper
though moby dick did contain the epilogue and so accounted for ishmael survival the british reviews influenced the american reception the new york north american miscellany for december summarized the verdict in the athenaeum
the reviewer of the december new york eclectic magazine had actually read moby dick in full and was puzzled why the athenaeum was so scornful of the ending
the attack on the whale by the spectator was reprinted in the december new york international magazine which inaugurated the influence of another unfavorable review
rounding off what american readers were told about the british reception in january harper monthly magazine attempted some damage control and wrote that the book had excited general interest among the london magazines
the most influential american review ranked according to the number of references to it appeared in the weekly magazine literary world which had printed melville mosses essay the preceding year
the first half of the first installment was devoted to an event of remarkable coincidence early in the month between the publishing of the british and the american edition whale had sunk the new bedford whaler ann alexander near chile
in the second installment duyckinck described moby dick as three books rolled into one he was pleased with the book as far as it was thorough account of the sperm whale less so with it as far as the adventures of the pequod crew were considered perceiving the characters as unrealistic and expressing inappropriate opinions on religions and condemned the essayistic rhapsodizing and moralizing with what he thought was little respect of what must be to the world the most sacred associations of life violated and defaced
the review prompted hawthorne to take the unusually aggressive step of reproving duyckinck by criticizing the review in letter to duyckinck of december it gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones
the author of the unsigned review in two installments on and november was later identified as publisher evert duyckinck it hardly seemed to me that the review of it in the literary world did justice to its best points
the transendental socialist george ripley published review in the new york tribune for november in which he compared the book favorably to mardi because the occasional touches of the subtle mysticism was not carried on to excess but kept within boundaries by the solid realism of the whaling context
ripley was almost surely also the author of the review in harper for december which saw in ahab quest the slight framework for something else beneath the whole story the subtle imaginative reader may perhaps find pregnant allegory intended to illustrate the mystery of human life
among the handful of other favorable reviews was one in the albion on november which saw the book as blend of truth and satire
melville friend nathaniel parker willis reviewing the book in the november home journal found it a very racy spirited curious and entertaining book it enlists the curiosity excites the sympathies and often charms the fancy
in the december spirit of the times editor williamt porter praised the book and all of melville five earlier works as the writings of man who is at once philosopher painter and poet
some other shorter reviews mixed their praise with genuine reservations about the irreverence and profane jesting as the new haven daily palladium for november phrased it
many reviewers parker observes had come to the conclusion that melville was capable of producing enjoyable romances but they could not see in him the author of great literature
within year after melville death moby dick along with typee omoo and mardi was reprinted by harper brothers giving it chance to be rediscovered
however only new york literary underground showed interest just enough to keep melville name circulating for the next years in the capital of american publishing
during this time few critics were willing to devote time space and modicum of praise to melville and his works or at least those that could still be easily obtained or remembered
main article adaptations of moby dick other works especially the poetry went largely forgotten in american author carl van doren became the first of this period to proselytize about melville value
in his idiosyncratic but influential studies in classic american literature novelist poet and short story writer h lawrence celebrated the originality and value of american authors among them melville
perhaps surprisingly lawrence saw moby dick as work of the first order despite his using the expurgated original english edition which also lacked the epilogue
the modern library brought out moby dick in and the lakeside press in chicago commissioned rockwell kent to design and illustrate striking three volume edition which appeared in
random house then issued one volume trade version of kent edition which in they reprinted as less expensive modern library giant
the novel has been adapted or represented in art film books cartoons television and more than dozen versions in comic book format
the first adaptation was the silent movie the sea beast starring john barrymore in which ahab returns to marry his fiancée after killing the whale
his study the american novel called moby dick pinnacle of american romanticism the most famous adaptation was the john huston film produced from screenplay by author ray bradbury
the long list of adaptations as bryant and springer put it demonstrates that the iconic image of an angry embittered american slaying mythic beast seemed to capture the popular imagination
they conclude that different readers in different periods of popular culture have rewritten moby dick to make it true cultural icon
american artist david klamen has cited the novel as an important influence on his dark slow to disclose paintings noting passage in the book in which mysterious undecipherable painting in bar is gradually revealed to depict whale
the narrator remembers moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes church service brothers and sisters my text this morning is the blackness of blackness
and the congregation answers that blackness is most black brother most black this scene ellison biographer arnold rampersad observes reprises moment in the second chapter of moby dick where ishmael wanders around new bedford looking for place to spend the night and momentarily joins congregation it was negro church and the preacher text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing there
according to rampersad it was melville who empowered ellison to insist on place in the american literary tradition by his example of representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text
rampersaf also believes ellison choice of first person narrator was inspired above all by moby dick and the novel even has similar opening sentence with the narrator introducing himself i am an invisible man
american author ralph ellison wrote tribute to the book in the prologue of his novel invisible man the oration by ellison blind preacher
