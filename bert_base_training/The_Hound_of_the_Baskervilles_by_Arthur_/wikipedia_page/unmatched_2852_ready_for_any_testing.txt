dr_james_mortimer asks mr_sherlock_holmes for advice after his friend sir charles_baskerville henry_baskerville was found dead in the park surrounding his manor in the moors of devonshire
the death was attributed to heart attack but according to dr_james_mortimer sir charles_baskerville face retained an expression of horror and not far from the corpse the footprints of gigantic hound were clearly visible
according to an old legend curse runs in the henry_baskerville family since the time of the english civil war when sir hugo henry_baskerville abducted and murdered woman in the mires of dartmoor only to be killed in turn by huge demonic hound
sir charles_baskerville believed in the plague of the hound and so does mr dr_james_mortimer who now fears for the next in line sir henry_baskerville
even though he dismisses the whole curse story as nonsense mr_sherlock_holmes accepts to meet sir henry_baskerville in london as soon as the latter arrives from canada where his branch of the family had moved in the past
the man is young and jovial good looking fellow skeptical toward the grim legend and eager to take possession of henry_baskerville hall even if he just found an anonymous note in the mail warning him to stay away from the moor
when someone tries to shoot sir henry_baskerville while he walking down street however mr_sherlock_holmes asks dr_watson to go with the young man and dr_james_mortimer to dartmooor in order to protect sir henry_baskerville and search for any clue about who menacing his life
allegedly the same creature has been haunting the place ever since causing the premature death of many henry_baskerville heirs mr_sherlock_holmes examining dr_james_mortimer walking stick mr_sherlock_holmes sees clue in the henry_baskerville portrait
the trio arrives to henry_baskerville hall an old and imposing manor in the middle of vast park managed by butler and his wife the housekeeper
the estate is surrounded by the moor and borders the grimpen mire where animals and humans can sink to death in quicksand
the news that convict has escaped from the local penitentiary and is hiding on the nearby hills add up to the barren landscape and the gloomy atmosphere
unexplicable events happen during the first night keeping the guests awake and only in the daylight dr_watson and sir henry_baskerville can relax while exploring the neighborhood and meet the scarse but peculiar residents of dartmoor
dr_watson keeps on searching for any lead to the identity of whoever attempting to sir henry_baskerville life and faithfully wires the details of his investigation to mr_sherlock_holmes
among the others stand out the stapletons brother and sister the man is overfriendly and bit too curious toward the newly arrived while the woman rare beauty seems all too weary of the place
distant howls and strange sightings trouble dr_watson during his long walks on the hills and his mood gets no better even inside henry_baskerville hall
the doctor grows suspicious of the butler who at night acts like he was signaling to someone in the moor with candle from window of the merripit_house
in the meantime sir henry_baskerville is drawn to ms mr_stapleton who seems to be afraid of her brother opinion on the matter
to make the puzzle more complex there are mr dr_james_mortimer maybe too eager to convince sir henry_baskerville that the curse is real an old and grumpy neighbour who likes to pry with his telescope into other people house beautiful woman with unclear ties to sir charles_baskerville and even bearded man roaming free in the hills and apparently hiding on tor where ancient tombs have been excavated by mr_stapleton for unclear purpose
for all the good dr_watson efforts it will be mr_sherlock_holmes in person to connect all the clues and solve the mistery but not before the spectral hound kills again
it is thought this merripit_house may have provided conan doyle with the inspiration for the hound of the baskervilles the ruins of fowelscombe merripit_house viewed in a possible model for henry_baskerville hall
sir arthur conan doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home undershaw from south africa where he had worked as volunteer physician at the langman field hospital in bloemfontein at the time of the second boer war
conan doyle had not written about mr_sherlock_holmes in eight years having killed off the character in the story the final problem
although the hound of the baskervilles is set before the latter events two years later conan doyle would bring mr_sherlock_holmes back for good explaining in the adventure of the empty merripit_house that mr_sherlock_holmes had faked his own death
his ideas came from the legend of richard cabell of brook hall in the parish of buckfastleigh devon which was the fundamental inspiration for the henry_baskerville tale of hellish hound and cursed country squire
he was assisted with the plot by year old daily express journalist named bertram fletcher robinson cabell tomb survives in the village of buckfastleigh
squire richard cabell lived for hunting and was what in those day was described as monstrously evil man he gained this reputation for amongst other thing immorality and having sold his soul to the devil
there was also rumour that he had murdered his wife elizabeth fowell daughter of sir edmund fowell baronet of fowelscombe on july he died and was laid to rest in the sepulchre
from that night on he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor usually on the anniversary of his death
the night of his interment saw phantom pack of hound come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb if the pack were not out hunting they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking
in an attempt to lay the soul to rest the villagers built large building around the tomb and to be doubly sure huge slab was placed
it is believed by weller that henry_baskerville hall is based on one of three possible house on or near dartmoor namely fowelscombe in the parish of ugborough the seat of the fowell baronets hayford hall near buckfastleigh also owned by john king of fowelscombe and brook hall in the parish of buckfastleigh about two miles east of hayford the actual home of richard cabell husband of elizabeth fowell
it has also been claimed that henry_baskerville hall is based on property in mid wales built in by one thomas mynors henry_baskerville
moreover devon folklore includes tales of fearsome supernatural dog known as the yeth hound that conan doyle may have heard the merripit_house was formerly named clyro court and was renamed henry_baskerville hall towards the end of the last century
arthur conan doyle was apparently family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of local legend of the hound of the baskervilles
still other tales claim that conan doyle was inspired by his time on holiday in north norfolk where the tale of black shuck is well known
dr_james_mortimer lynam molloy friend of doyle and author of love old sweet song married florence henry_baskerville daughter of henry_baskerville of crowsley park oxfordshire
the pre gothic cromer hall where conan doyle stayed also closely resembles doyle vivid descriptions of henry_baskerville hall the gates to the park had statues of hell hound spears through their mouths
in doyle original manuscript of the book was broken up into individual leaves as part of promotional campaign by doyle american publisher they were used as part of window displays by individual booksellers
out of an estimated leaves only are known to still exist including all the leaves from chapter held by the new york public library
above the lintel there was another statue of hell hound other leaves are owned by university libraries and private collectors newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in for us
