mr_jerry_cruncher porter and messenger for tellson_s_bank tellson_s_bank and secret resurrection man body snatcher though rough and abusive towards his wife he provides courageous service to the manettes in book the third
his first name is short for jeremiah the latter name shares meaning with the name of mr_jarvis_lorry mr_jarvis_lorry lorry manager at tellson_s_bank tellson_s_bank a gentleman of sixty

about seventeen when the novel begins she is described as short and slight with pretty figure quantity of golden hair pair of blue eyes
although sydney mr_carton is in love with her he declares himself an unsuitable candidate for her hand in marriage and instead she marries mr_charles_darnay with whom she is very much in love and bears him daughter
she is the golden thread after whom book the second is named so called because she holds her father and her family lives together and because of her blond hair like her mother
however miss_lucie genuinely cares about mr_carton welfare and defends him when he is criticized by others she also ties nearly every character in the book together
monsieur_defarge given name ernest he is the owner of paris wine shop and leader of the jacquerie a bull necked martial looking man of thirty
he was dark man altogether with good eyes and good bold breadth between them he is devoted to dr miss_manette having been his servant as youth
one of the key revolutionary leaders in which he is known as jacques_one four he embraces the revolution as noble cause unlike many other revolutionaries
though he truly believes in the principles of the revolution monsieur_defarge is far more moderate than some of the other participants notably his wife
given name thérèse vengeful female revolutionary she is arguably the novel antagonist and is presented as more extreme and bloodthirsty personality than her husband ernest
there were many women at that time upon whom the time laid dreadfully disfiguring hand but there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman of strong and fearless character of shrewd sense and readiness of great determination of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities
the source of her implacable hatred of the evrémonde family is revealed late in the novel to be the rape of her sister and killing of her brother when she was child
madame monsieur_defarge jacques_one two and three revolutionary compatriots of ernest monsieur_defarge jacques_one three is especially bloodthirsty and serves as juryman on the revolutionary tribunals
dr alexandre miss_manette miss_lucie father when the book opens he has just been released after ghastly eighteen year as prisoner in the bastille

all his happiness is put at risk in book the third when madame monsieur_defarge resolves to send evrémonde mr_charles_darnay to the guillotine regardless of his having renounced the evrémondes wealth and cruelty
at the same time the reader learns the cause of dr miss_manette imprisonment he had rendered medical care to madame monsieur_defarge brother and sister following the injuries inflicted on them by the evrémonde twins back in the evrémondes decided he couldnt be allowed to expose them
he achieves recovery and contentment with her her eventual husband mr_charles_darnay and their little daughter book the second five year later
she is very religious woman but her husband somewhat paranoid claims she is praying what he calls flopping against him and that is why he does not often succeed at work
mr_jerry_cruncher often verbally and almost as often physically abuses her but at the end of the story he appears to feel bit guilty about this
young mr_jerry_cruncher often follows his father around to his father odd jobs and at one point in the story follows his father at night and discovers that his father is resurrection man
young mr_jerry_cruncher looks up to his father as role model and aspires to become resurrection man himself when he grows up

he puts his family happiness at risk with his courageous decision to return to paris to save the imprisoned monsieur_gabelle who unbeknownst to him has been coerced into luring him there
once in paris he is stunned to discover that regardless of his rejection of his family exploitative and abusive record he is imprisoned incommunicado simply for being an aristocrat
released after the testimony of dr miss_manette he is re arrested and sentenced to be guillotined owing to madame monsieur_defarge undying hatred of all evrémondes
this death sentence provides the pretext for the novel climax john mr_barsad real name solomon miss_pross an informer in london and later employed by the monsieur_the_marquis st evrémonde
when introduced at mr_charles_darnay trial he is giving damning evidence against the defendant but it becomes clear to the reader that he is an oily untrustworthy character
moving to paris he takes service as police spy in the saint_antoine district under the french monarchy following the revolution he becomes an agent for revolutionary france at which point he must hide his british identity
although man of low character his position as spy allows him to arrange for sydney mr_carton final heroic act after mr_carton blackmails him with revealing his duplicity
following his chaotic funeral procession in book the second chapter his coffin is dug up by mr_jerry_cruncher and his fellow resurrection men
in book the third mr_jerry_cruncher reveals that in fact the casket contained only rocks and that roger_cly was clearly still alive and no doubt carrying on his spying activities

roger_cly mr_barsad collaborator in spying and giving questionable testimony mr_stryver an ambitious barrister senior partner to sydney mr_carton he wants to marry miss_lucie miss_manette because he believes that she is attractive enough
however he is not truly in love with her and in fact treats her condescendingly mr_jarvis_lorry suggests that marrying miss_lucie would be unwise and
sydney mr_carton quick minded and highly intelligent but depressed english barrister referred to by dickens as the jackal because of his deference to mr_stryver
when introduced he is hard drinking cynic having watched mr_stryver advance while never taking advantage of his own considerable gifts dickens writes that the sun rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions incapable of their directed exercise incapable of his own help and his own happiness sensible to the blight on him and resigning himself to let it eat him away
mr_stryver after thinking it over talks himself out of it later marrying rich widow instead in love with miss_lucie miss_manette she cares about him but more as concerned mother figure than potential mate
miss_lucie miss_manette governess since miss_lucie was ten year old one of those unselfish creatures found only among women who will for pure love and admiration bind themselves willing slaves to youth when they have lost it to beauty that they never had
he ultimately becomes selfless hero redeeming everything by sacrificing his life for worthy cause miss_pross she is fiercely loyal to miss_lucie and to england
she believes her long lost brother solomon now the spy and perjurer john mr_barsad is the one man worthy of ladybird ignoring the fact that he was heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed as stake to speculate with and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore
she is not afraid to physically fight those she believes are endangering the people she loves she permanently loses her hearing when the fatal pistol shot goes off during her climactic fight with madame monsieur_defarge
it took four men all four a blaze with gorgeous decoration and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur lips
it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens
deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must have died of two
and who among the company at monseigneur reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord could possibly doubt that system rooted in frizzled hangman powdered gold laced pumped and white silk stockinged would see the very stars out
monseigneur an unnamed generic aristocrat whose extraordinary decadence and self absorption described in detail are used by dickens to characterize the ancien régime in general
his fellow nobles also luxuriate in vast wealth but this does not inoculate them from feeling envy and resentment as the monsieur_the_marquis st evrémonde leaves monseigneur house with his hat under his arm and his snuff box in his hand he turns to the latter bedroom and quietly says i devote you to the devil
the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur when the revolution begins monseigneur puts on his cook clothing and ignominiously flees escaping with only his life
monsieur_the_marquis st evrémonde uncle of mr_charles_darnay a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty in manner and with face like fine mask
determined to preserve the traditional prerogatives of the nobility until the end of his life he is the twin brother of mr_charles_darnay late father both men were exceptionally arrogant and cruel to peasants
lamenting reforms which have imposed some restraints on the abusive powers of his class the monsieur_the_marquis is out of favor at the royal court at the time of his assassination
murdered in his bed by the peasant gaspard gaspard peasant whose son is run over and killed by the monsieur_the_marquis st evrémonde carriage
he plunges knife into evrémonde heart pinning note that reads drive him fast to his tomb reference to the careless speed that caused his little boy death
the mender of roads peasant who later works as woodsawyer the defarges bring him into conspiracy against the aristocracy where he is referred to as jacques_one five
after being in hiding for year he is found arrested and executed théophile monsieur_gabelle gabelle is the postmaster and some other taxing functionary united for the tenants of the monsieur_the_marquis st evrémonde
monsieur_gabelle is imprisoned by the revolutionaries and his beseeching letter brings mr_charles_darnay to france monsieur_gabelle is named after the hated salt tax
the vengeance companion of madame monsieur_defarge referred to as her shadow and lieutenant member of the sisterhood of women revolutionaries in saint_antoine and revolutionary zealot
mr_carton predicts that the vengeance monsieur_defarge roger_cly and mr_barsad will be consumed by the revolution and end up on the guillotine
the seamstress a young woman with slight girlish form sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour and large widely opened patient eyes having been caught up in the terror she strikes up conversation with the man she assumes is evrémonde in the large room where the next day guillotine victims are gathered
when she realizes that another man has taken mr_charles_darnay place she admires his sacrifice and asks if she can hold his hand during their tumbrel ride to the place of execution
while performing in the frozen deep dickens was given play to read called the dead heart by watts phillips which had the historical setting the basic storyline and the climax that dickens used in tale of two cities
the play was produced while tale of two cities was being serialized in all the year round and led to talk of plagiarism
many frenchmen and women did change their names to show their enthusiasm for the revolution other sources are the french revolution history by thomas carlyle especially important for the novel rhetoric and symbolism
zanoni by edward bulwer lytton the castle spector by matthew lewis travels in france by arthur young and tableau de paris by louis sébastien mercier
dickens also used material from an account of imprisonment during the terror by beaumarchais and records of the trial of french spy published in the annual register
the chapter novel was published in weekly instalments in dickens new literary periodical titled all the year round from april to november dickens also republished the chapters as eight monthly sections in green covers
the first weekly instalment of tale of two cities ran in the first issue of all the year round on april
all but three of dickens previous novels had appeared as monthly instalments prior to publication as books the last ran thirty weeks later on november
a tale of two cities has been cited as one of the best selling novels of all time world cat listed editions of the work including print editions
a tale of two cities is one of only two works of historical fiction by mr_charles_darnay dickens the other being barnaby rudge
dickens uses literal translations of french idioms for characters who cannot speak english such as what the devil do you do in that galley there
the penguin classics edition of the novel notes that not all readers have regarded the experiment as success l borges quipped dickens lived in london
in his book tale of two cities based on the french revolution we see that he really could not write tale of two cities
most broadly sydney mr_carton is resurrected in spirit at the novel close even as he paradoxically gives up his physical life to save mr_charles_darnay
he was resident of just one city london in dickens england resurrection always sat firmly in christian context more concretely book the first deals with the rebirth of dr miss_manette from the living death of his incarceration
resurrection appears for the first time when mr_jarvis_lorry replies to the message carried by mr_jerry_cruncher with the word recalled to life
resurrection also appears during mr_jarvis_lorry coach ride to dover as he constantly ponders hypothetical conversation with dr miss_manette buried how long
you know that you are recalled to life he believes he is helping with dr miss_manette revival and imagines himself digging up dr miss_manette from his grave
resurrection is major theme in the novel in mr_jarvis_lorry thoughts of dr miss_manette resurrection is first spotted as theme it is also the last theme
mr_carton sacrifice dickens originally wanted to call the entire novel recalled to life this instead became the title of the first of the novel three books
mr_jerry_cruncher is also part of the recurring theme he himself is involved in death and resurrection in way the reader does not yet know
the first piece of foreshadowing comes in his remark to himself you be in blazing bad way if recalling to life was to come into fashion mr_jerry_cruncher
five year later one cloudy and very dark night in june mr_jarvis_lorry reawakens the reader interest in the mystery by telling mr_jerry_cruncher it is almost night to bring the dead out of their graves
the black humour of this statement becomes obvious only much later on mr_jerry_cruncher responds firmly that he has never seen the night do that
it turns out that mr_jerry_cruncher involvement with the theme of resurrection is that he is what the victorians called resurrection man one who illegally digs up dead bodies to sell to medical men there was no legal way to procure cadavers for study at that time
the opposite of resurrection is of course death death and resurrection appear often in the novel dickens is angered that in france and england courts hand out death sentences for insignificant crimes
in france peasants had formerly been put to death without any trial at the whim of noble the next room my bedroom
the demolition of dr miss_manette shoe making workbench by miss_pross and mr_jarvis_lorry is described as the burning of the body
it seems clear that this is rare case where death or destruction the opposite of resurrection has positive connotation since the burning helps liberate the doctor from the memory of his long imprisonment
one fellow was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter his daughter but dickens description of this kind and healing act is strikingly odd
so wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds that mr_jarvis_lorry and miss_pross while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in horrible crime
he even finds god during the last few days of his life repeating christ soothing word i am the resurrection and the life
the accomplices an illustration for book chapter by phiz sydney mr_carton martyrdom atones for all his past wrongdoings resurrection is the dominant theme of the last part of the novel
mr_charles_darnay is rescued at the last moment and recalled to life mr_carton chooses death and resurrection to life better than that which he has ever known it was the peacefullest man face ever beheld there
in the broadest sense at the end of the novel dickens foresees resurrected social order in france rising from the ashes of the old one
he looked sublime and prophetic hans biedermann writes that water is the fundamental symbol of all the energy of the unconscious
this symbolism suits dickens novel in tale of two cities the frequent images of water stand for the building anger of the peasant mob an anger that dickens sympathizes with to point but ultimately finds irrational and even animalistic
early in the book dickens suggests this when he writes he sea did what it liked and what it liked was destruction
an energy that can be dangerous when it overflows its proper limits a frequent dream sequence the sea here represents the coming mob of revolutionaries
after gaspard murders the monsieur_the_marquis he is hanged there forty feet high and is left hanging poisoning the water the poisoning of the well represents the bitter impact of gaspard execution on the collective feeling of the peasants
after gaspard death the storming of the bastille is led from the st saint_antoine neighbourhood at least by the defarges as whirlpool of boiling waters has centre point so all this raging circled around monsieur_defarge wine shop and every human drop in the cauldron had tendency to be sucked towards the vortex
with roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped into detested word mr_charles_darnay jailer is described as unwholesomely bloated in both face and person as to look like man who had been drowned and filled with water
later during the reign of terror the revolution had grown so much more wicked and distracted that the rivers of the south were encumbered with bodies of the violently drowned by night
later crowd is swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent street the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away
the crowd is envisioned as sea during the fight with miss_pross madame monsieur_defarge clings to her with more than the hold of drowning woman
commentators on the novel have noted the irony that madame monsieur_defarge is killed by her own gun and perhaps dickens means by the above quote to suggest that such vicious vengefulness as madame monsieur_defarge will eventually destroy even its perpetrators
yet in mr_carton last walk he watches an eddy that turned and turned purposeless until the stream absorbed it and carried it onto the sea his fulfilment while masochistic and superego driven is nonetheless an ecstatic union with the subconscious
so many read the novel in freudian light as exalting the british superego over the french id as is frequent in european literature good and evil are symbolized by light and darkness
miss_lucie miss_manette is the light as represented literally by her name and madame monsieur_defarge is darkness darkness represents uncertainty fear and peril
it is dark when mr_jarvis_lorry rides to dover it is dark in the prisons dark shadow follow madame monsieur_defarge dark gloomy doldrums disturb dr miss_manette his capture and captivity are shrouded in darkness the monsieur_the_marquis estate is burned in the dark of night mr_jerry_cruncher raids graves in the darkness mr_charles_darnay second arrest also occurs at night
both miss_lucie and mr_jarvis_lorry feel the dark threat that is madame monsieur_defarge that dreadful woman seems to throw shadow on me remarks miss_lucie
although mr_jarvis_lorry tries to comfort her the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself madame monsieur_defarge is like shadow over the white road the snow symbolising purity and madame monsieur_defarge darkness corruption
dickens also compares the dark colour of blood to the pure white snow the blood takes on the shade of the crimes of its shedders
his childhood included some of the pains of poverty in england as he had to work in factory as child to help his family
mr_charles_darnay dickens was champion of the poor in his life and in his writings his father john dickens continually lived beyond his means and eventually went to debtors prison
dickens considered the workings of mob in this novel and in barnaby rudge creating believable characters who act differently when the mob mentality takes over
mr_charles_darnay was forced to leave school and began working ten hour days at warren blacking warehouse earning six shillings week the reasons for revolution by the lower classes are clear and given in the novel
the reign of terror was horrific time in france and she gives some notion for how things went too far from the perspective of the citizens as opposed to the actions of the de facto government in that year
dickens does not spare his descriptions of mob actions including the night dr miss_manette and his family arrive at tellson_s_bank tellson_s_bank in paris to meet mr_jarvis_lorry saying that the people in the vicious crowd display eyes which any unbrutalized beholder would have given twenty year of life to petrify with well directed gun
some of his characters notably madame monsieur_defarge have no limit to their vengeance for crimes against them the reader is shown that the poor are brutalised in france and england alike
as crime proliferates the executioner in england is stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals now hanging housebreaker now burning people in the hand or hanging broke man for stealing sixpence
in france boy is sentenced to have his hands removed and be burned alive only because he did not kneel down in the rain before parade of monks passing some fifty yards away
at the lavish residence of monseigneur we find brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives military officers destitute of military knowledge doctors who made great fortunes for imaginary disorders
this incident is fictional but is based on true story related by voltaire in famous pamphlet an account of the death of the chevalier de la barre
so riled is dickens at the brutality of english law that he depicts some of its punishments with sarcasm the whipping post another dear old institution very humanising and softening to behold in action
he faults the law for not seeking reform whatever is is right is the dictum of the old bailey the gruesome portrayal of quartering highlights its atrocity
dickens wants his readers to be careful that the same revolution that so damaged france will not happen in britain which at least at the beginning of the book is shown to be nearly as unjust as france ruth glancy has argued that dickens portrays france and england as nearly equivalent at the beginning of the novel but that as the novel progresses england comes to look better and better climaxing in miss_pross pro britain speech at the end of the novel
he repeatedly uses the metaphor of sowing and reaping if the aristocracy continues to plant the seeds of revolution through behaving unjustly they can be certain of harvesting that revolution in time
but his warning is addressed not to the british lower classes but to the aristocracy the lower classes do not have any agency in this metaphor they simply react to the behaviour of the aristocracy
in this sense it can be said that while dickens sympathizes with the poor he identifies with the rich they are the book audience its us and not its them
sow the same seed of rapacious licence and oppression over again and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind
with the people starving and begging the monsieur_the_marquis for food his uncharitable response is to let the people eat grass the people are left with nothing but onions to eat and are forced to starve while the nobles are living lavishly upon the people backs
crush humanity out of shape once more under similar hammers and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms every time the nobles refer to the life of the peasants it is only to destroy or humiliate the poor
some have argued that in tale of two cities dickens reflects on his recently begun affair with eighteen year old actress ellen ternan which was possibly platonic but certainly romantic
miss_lucie miss_manette has been noted as resembling ternan physically after starring in play by wilkie collins titled the frozen deep dickens was first inspired to write tale
in the play dickens played the part of man who sacrifices his own life so that his rival may have the woman they both love the love triangle in the play became the basis for the relationships between mr_charles_darnay miss_lucie miss_manette and sydney mr_carton in tale
the plot hinges on the near perfect resemblance between sydney mr_carton and mr_charles_darnay the two look so alike that mr_carton twice saves mr_charles_darnay through the inability of others to tell them apart
sydney mr_carton and mr_charles_darnay may also bear importantly on dickens personal life do you particularly like the man he muttered at his own image why should you particularly like man who resembles you
there is nothing in you to like you know that what change you have made in yourself a good reason for talking to man
change places with him and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was and commiserated by that agitated face as he was
that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might have been come on and have it out in plain word
many have felt that mr_carton and mr_charles_darnay are doppelgängers which eric rabkin defines as pair of characters that together represent one psychological persona in the narrative
if so they would prefigure such works as robert louis stevenson dr jekyll and mr hyde mr_charles_darnay is worthy and respectable but dull at least to most modern readers mr_carton disreputable but magnetic
one can only suspect whose psychological persona it is that mr_carton and mr_charles_darnay together embody if they do but it is often thought to be the psyche of dickens himself
dickens might have been quite aware that between them mr_carton and mr_charles_darnay shared his own initials frequent property of his characters
however he denied it when asked the novel takes place primarily in london and paris in the latter half of the eighteenth century
it spans time period of roughly thirty six year with the chronologically first events taking place in december and the last in either late or early
research published in the dickensian in suggests that the house at greek street now the house of st barnabas forms the basis for dr miss_manette and miss_lucie london house
in building at the back attainable by courtyard where plane tree rustled its green leaves church organs claimed to be made and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had golden arm starting out of the wall as if he had beaten himself precious
the golden arm an arm and hammer symbol an ancient sign of the gold beater craft now resides at the mr_charles_darnay dickens museum but you could have seen modern replica sticking out of the wall near the pillars of hercules pub at the western end of miss_manette street formerly rose street until this building was demolished in
on the other hand mrs oliphant finds little of dickens in the novel and critic james fitzjames stephen sparked off scandal by calling it dish of puppy pie and stewed cat which is not disguised by the cooking and a disjointed framework for the display of the tawdry wares which are mr dickens stock in trade
