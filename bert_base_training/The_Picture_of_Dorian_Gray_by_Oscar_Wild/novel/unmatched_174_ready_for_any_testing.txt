the picture of mr_dorian_gray by oscar wilde the preface the artist is the creator of beautiful thing to reveal art and conceal the artist is art aim
the critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful thing the highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography
those who find ugly meanings in beautiful thing are corrupt without being charming this is a fault those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful thing are the cultivated
for these there is hope they are the elect to whom beautiful thing mean only beauty there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book
book are well written or badly written that is all the nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of caliban seeing his own face in a glass
the moral life of man forms part of the subject matter of the artist but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium
the nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of caliban not seeing his own face in a glass no artist desires to prove anything
even thing that are true can be proved no artist has ethical sympathies an ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style
no artist is ever morbid the artist can express everything thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art
vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art from the point of view of form the type of all the art is the art of the musician
from the point of view of feeling the actor craft is the type all art is at once surface and symbol
those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril those who read the symbol do so at their peril
it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new complex and vital
when critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself we can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it
the only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely all art is quite useless oscar wilde chapter
the studio was filled with the rich odour of roses and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac or the more delicate perfume of the pink flowering thorn
from the corner of the divan of persian saddle bags on which he was lying smoking as was his custom innumerable cigarettes lord_henry_wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey sweet and honey coloured blossoms of a laburnum whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window producing a kind of momentary japanese effect and making him think of those pallid jade faced painter of tokyo who through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion
the sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine seemed to make the stillness more oppressive
in the centre of the room clamped to an upright easel stood the full length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty and in front of it some little distance away was sitting the artist himself basil_hallward whose sudden disappearance some year ago caused at the time such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures
as the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art a smile of pleasure passed across his face and seemed about to linger there
but he suddenly started up and closing his eye placed his fingers upon the lids as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake
the dim roar of london was like the bourdon note of a distant organ it is your best work basil_hallward the best thing you have ever done said lord_henry_wotton languidly
whenever i have gone there there have been either so many people that i have not been able to see the picture which was dreadful or so many picture that i have not been able to see the people which was worse
you must certainly send it next year to the grosvenor the academy is too large and too vulgar the grosvenor is really the only place
i dont think i shall send it anywhere he answered tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friend laugh at him at oxford
lord_henry_wotton elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy opium tainted cigarette
no i wont send it anywhere not send it anywhere my dear fellow why have you any reason
what odd chaps you painter are you do anything in the world to gain a reputation as soon as you have one you seem to want to throw it away
it is silly of you for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about
a portrait like this would set you far above all the young man in england and make the old man quite jealous if old man are ever capable of any emotion
i know you will laugh at me he replied but i really cant exhibit it i have put too much of myself into it
lord_henry_wotton stretched himself out on the divan and laughed yes i knew you would but it is quite true all the same
upon my word basil_hallward i didnt know you were so vain and i really cant see any resemblance between you with your rugged strong face and your coal black hair and this young adonis who look as if he was made out of ivory and rose leaves
too much of yourself in it why my dear basil_hallward he is a narcissus and you well of course you have an intellectual expression and all that
but beauty real beauty ends where an intellectual expression begins intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face
the moment one sits down to think one becomes all nose or all forehead or something horrid look at the successful man in any of the learned professions
a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen and as a natural consequence he always look absolutely delightful
how perfectly hideous they are except of course in the church but then in the church they dont think your mysterious young friend whose name you have never told me but whose picture really fascinates me never thinks
he is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence
i feel quite sure of that dont flatter yourself basil_hallward you are not in the least like him you dont understand me harry answered the artist
of course i am not like him i know that perfectly well indeed i should be sorry to look like him
there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings
you shrug your shoulders i am telling you the truth it is better not to be different from one fellows the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world
they can sit at their ease and gape at the play if they know nothing of victory they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat
they live as we all should live undisturbed indifferent and without disquiet they neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it from alien hand
your rank and wealth harry my brains such as they are my art whatever it may be worth mr_dorian_gray good look we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us suffer terribly
mr_dorian_gray is that his name asked lord_henry_wotton walking across the studio towards basil_hallward yes that is his name
i didnt intend to tell it to you but why not oh i cant explain when i like people immensely i never tell their name to any one
it is like surrendering a part of them i have grown to love secrecy it seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us
the commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it when i leave town now i never tell my people where i am going
it is a silly habit i dare say but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one life
if i did i would lose all my pleasure i suppose you think me awfully foolish about it not at all answered lord_henry_wotton not at all my dear basil_hallward
you seem to forget that i am married and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties
when we meet we do meet occasionally when we dine out together or go down to the duke we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious face
i never know where my wife is and my wife never knows what i am doing my wife is very good at it much better in fact than i am
she never gets confused over her dates and i always do but when she does find me out she makes no row at all
i hate the way you talk about your married life harry said basil_hallward strolling towards the door that led into the garden
i sometimes wish she would but she merely laughs at me i believe that you are really a very good husband but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues
you are an extraordinary fellow you never say a moral thing and you never do a wrong thing your cynicism is simply a pose
being natural is simply a pose and the most irritating pose i know cried lord_henry_wotton laughing and the two young man went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush
the sunlight slipped over the polished leaves in the grass white daisies were tremulous after a pause lord_henry_wotton pulled out his watch
i am afraid i must be going basil_hallward he murmured and before i go i insist on your answering a question i put to you some time ago
what is that said the painter keeping his eye fixed on the ground you know quite well i do not harry
well i will tell you what it is i want you to explain to me why you wont exhibit mr_dorian_gray picture
i want the real reason i told you the real reason no you did not you said it was because there was too much of yourself in it
harry said basil_hallward looking him straight in the face every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist not of the sitter
it is not he who is revealed by the painter it is rather the painter who on the coloured canvas reveals himself
the reason i will not exhibit this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of my own soul
now that is childish the sitter is merely the accident the occasion lord_henry_wotton laughed and what is that he asked
i will tell you said basil_hallward but an expression of perplexity came over his face i am all expectation basil_hallward continued his companion glancing at him
oh there is really very little to tell harry answered the painter and i am afraid you will hardly understand it
perhaps you will hardly believe it lord_henry_wotton smiled and leaning down plucked a pink petalled daisy from the grass and examined it
i am quite sure i shall understand it he replied gazing intently at the little golden white feathered disk and as for believing thing i can believe anything provided that it is quite incredible
the wind shook some blossoms from the trees and the heavy lilac blooms with their clustering stars moved to and fro in the languid air
a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall and like a blue thread a long thin dragon fly floated past on its brown gauze wings
lord_henry_wotton felt as if he could hear basil_hallward heart beating and wondered what was coming the story is simply this said the painter after some time
you know we poor artist have to show ourselves in society from time to time just to remind the public that we are not savages
with an evening coat and a white tie as you told me once anybody even a stock broker can gain a reputation for being civilized
well after i had been in the room about ten minutes talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians i suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me
two months ago i went to a crush at lady brandon i turned half way round and saw mr_dorian_gray for the first time
i knew that i had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that if i allowed it to do so it would absorb my whole nature my whole soul my very art itself
when our eye met i felt that i was growing pale a curious sensation of terror came over me i did not want any external influence in my life
you know yourself harry how independent i am by nature i have always been my own master had at least always been so till i met mr_dorian_gray
then but i dont know how to explain it to you something seemed to tell me that i was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life
i had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joy and exquisite sorrows i grew afraid and turned to quit the room
it was not conscience that made me do so it was a sort of cowardice i take no credit to myself for trying to escape
conscience and cowardice are really the same thing basil_hallward conscience is the trade name of the firm that is all i dont believe that harry and i dont believe you do either
however whatever was my motive and it may have been pride for i used to be very proud i certainly struggled to the door
there of course i stumbled against lady brandon you are not going to run away so soon mr basil_hallward she screamed out
yes she is a peacock in everything but beauty said lord_henry_wotton pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers
she brought me up to royalties and people with stars and garters and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses
you know her curiously shrill voice i could not get rid of her she spoke of me as her dearest friend
i believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers which is the nineteenth century standard of immortality
i had only met her once before but she took it into her head to lionize me suddenly i found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me
we were quite close almost touching our eye met again it was reckless of me but i asked lady brandon to introduce me to him
perhaps it was not so reckless after all it was simply inevitable we would have spoken to each other without any introduction
i am sure of that mr_dorian_gray told me so afterwards he too felt that we were destined to know each other
and how did lady brandon describe this wonderful young man asked his companion i know she goes in for giving a rapid precis of all her guests
i remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons and hissing into my ear in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room the most astounding details
i simply fled i like to find out people for myself but lady brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods
she either explains them entirely away or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know poor lady brandon
you are hard on her harry said basil_hallward listlessly my dear fellow she tried to found a salon and only succeeded in opening a restaurant
how could i admire her but tell me what did she say about mr_dorian_gray oh something like charming boy poor dear mother and i absolutely inseparable
quite forget what he does afraid he doesnt do anything oh yes plays the piano or is it the violin dear mr_dorian_gray neither of us could help laughing and we became friend at once
laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship and it is far the best ending for one said the young lord plucking another daisy
basil_hallward shook his head you dont understand what friendship is harry he murmured or what enmity is for that matter
how horribly unjust of you cried lord_henry_wotton tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky
you like every one that is to say you are indifferent to every one yes horribly unjust of you i make a great difference between people
i choose my friend for their good look my acquaintances for their good characters and my enemies for their good intellects
a man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies i have not got one who is a fool
they are all man of some intellectual power and consequently they all appreciate me is that very vain of me i think it is rather vain
i should think it was harry but according to your category i must be merely an acquaintance my dear old basil_hallward you are much more than an acquaintance
and much less than a friend a sort of brother i suppose oh brothers i dont care for brothers my elder brother wont die and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else
harry exclaimed basil_hallward frowning my dear fellow i am not quite serious but i cant help detesting my relations
i suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves
the masses feel that drunkenness stupidity and immorality should be their own special property and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves
i quite sympathize with the rage of the english democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders when poor southwark got into the divorce court their indignation was quite magnificent
and yet i dont suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly i dont agree with a single word that you have said and
what is more harry i feel sure you dont either lord_henry_wotton stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane
if one puts forward an idea to a true englishman always a rash thing to do he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong
how english you are basil_hallward that is the second time you have made that observation the only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself
indeed the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is the more purely intellectual will the idea be as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants his desires or his prejudices
now the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it however i dont propose to discuss politics sociology or metaphysics with you
i like persons better than principles and i like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world tell me more about mr_dorian_gray
how often do you see him every day i couldnt be happy if i didnt see him every day he is absolutely necessary to me
how extraordinary i thought you would never care for anything but your art he is all my art to me now said the painter gravely
the first is the appearance of a new medium for art and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also
what the invention of oil painting was to the venetians the face of antinous was to late greek sculpture and the face of mr_dorian_gray will some day be to me
i sometimes think harry that there are only two eras of any importance in the world history it is not merely that i paint from him draw from him sketch from him
i wont tell you that i am dissatisfied with what i have done of him or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it
there is nothing that art cannot express and i know that the work i have done since i met mr_dorian_gray is good work is the best work of my life
but in some curious way i wonder will you understand me his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art an entirely new mode of style
of course i have done all that but he is much more to me than a model or a sitter i see thing differently i think of them differently
i can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before a dream of form in day of thought who is it who says that
the merely visible presence of this lad for he seems to me little more than a lad though he is really over twenty his merely visible presence ah
i forget but it is what mr_dorian_gray has been to me i wonder can you realize all that that means
unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit all the perfection of the spirit that is greek
we in our madness have separated the two and have invented a realism that is vulgar an ideality that is void
you remember that landscape of mine for which agnew offered me such a huge price but which i would not part with
the harmony of soul and body how much that is harry if you only knew what mr_dorian_gray is to me it is one of the best thing i have ever done
some subtle influence passed from him to me and for the first time in my life i saw in the plain woodland the wonder i had always looked for and always missed
and why is it so because while i was painting it mr_dorian_gray sat beside me basil_hallward this is extraordinary
i must see mr_dorian_gray basil_hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden after some time he came back
harry he said mr_dorian_gray is to me simply a motive in art you might see nothing in him i see everything in him
he is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there he is a suggestion as i have said of a new manner
i find him in the curves of certain lines in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours that is all
because without intending it i have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry of which of course i have never cared to speak to him
then why wont you exhibit his portrait asked lord_henry_wotton he knows nothing about it he shall never know anything about it
but the world might guess it and i will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eye my heart shall never be put under their microscope
there is too much of myself in the thing harry too much of myself poets are not so scrupulous as you are
they know how useful passion is for publication nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions i hate them for it cried basil_hallward
an artist should create beautiful thing but should put nothing of his own life into them we live in an age when man treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography
some day i will show the world what it is and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of mr_dorian_gray
we have lost the abstract sense of beauty i think you are wrong basil_hallward but i wont argue with you it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue
tell me is mr_dorian_gray very fond of you the painter considered for a few moment he likes me he answered after a pause i know he likes me
of course i flatter him dreadfully i find a strange pleasure in saying thing to him that i know i shall be sorry for having said
as a rule he is charming to me and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand thing now and then however he is horribly thoughtless and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain
then i feel harry that i have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat a bit of decoration to charm his vanity an ornament for a summer day
day in summer basil_hallward are apt to linger murmured lord_henry_wotton perhaps you will tire sooner than he will it is a sad thing to think of but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty
in the wild struggle for existence we want to have something that endures and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts in the silly hope of keeping our place
that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over educate ourselves the thoroughly well informed man that is the modern ideal
and the mind of the thoroughly well informed man is a dreadful thing it is like a bric a brac shop all monsters and dust with everything priced above its proper value
some day you will look at your friend and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing or you wont like his tone of colour or something
i think you will tire first all the same you will bitterly reproach him in your own heart and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you
the next time he calls you will be perfectly cold and indifferent it will be a great pity for it will alter you
what you have told me is quite a romance a romance of art one might call it and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic
harry dont talk like that as long as i live the personality of mr_dorian_gray will dominate me you cant feel what i feel
you change too often ah my dear basil_hallward that is exactly why i can feel it those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love it is the faithless who know love tragedies
and lord_henry_wotton struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self conscious and satisfied air as if he had summed up the world in a phrase
there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy and the blue cloud shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows
how pleasant it was in the garden and how delightful other people emotions were much more delightful than their ideas it seemed to him
he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil_hallward
had he gone to his aunt he would have been sure to have met lord goodbody there and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging house
each class would have preached the importance of those virtues for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own life
one own soul and the passion of one friend those were the fascinating thing in life the rich would have spoken on the value of thrift and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour
it was charming to have escaped all that as he thought of his aunt an idea seemed to strike him he turned to basil_hallward and said my dear fellow i have just remembered
remembered what harry where i heard the name of mr_dorian_gray where was it asked basil_hallward with a slight frown
she told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the east end and that his name was mr_dorian_gray
dont look so angry basil_hallward it was at my aunt lady_agatha i am bound to state that she never told me
he was good looking woman have no appreciation of good look at least good woman have not she said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature
i at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair horribly freckled and tramping about on huge foot
i wish i had known it was your friend i am very glad you didnt harry why i dont want you to meet him
you dont want me to meet him no mr_dorian_gray is in the studio sir said the butler coming into the garden
you must introduce me now cried lord_henry_wotton laughing the painter turned to his servant who stood blinking in the sunlight
ask mr_dorian_gray to wait parker i shall be in in a few moment the man bowed and went up the walk
then he looked at lord_henry_wotton mr_dorian_gray is my dearest friend he said he has a simple and a beautiful nature
your aunt was quite right in what she said of him dont spoil him dont try to influence him your influence would be bad
dont take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses my life as an artist depends on him
the world is wide and has many marvellous people in it mind harry i trust you he spoke very slowly and the word seemed wrung out of him almost against his will
what nonsense you talk said lord_henry_wotton smiling and taking basil_hallward by the arm he almost led him into the house
he was seated at the piano with his back to them turning over the pages of a volume of schumann forest scenes
chapter as they entered they saw mr_dorian_gray you must lend me these basil_hallward he cried i want to learn them
oh i am tired of sitting and i dont want a life sized portrait of myself answered the lad swinging round on the music stool in a wilful petulant manner
they are perfectly charming that entirely depends on how you sit to day mr_dorian_gray when he caught sight of lord_henry_wotton a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment and he started up
i beg your pardon basil_hallward but i didnt know you had any one with you this is lord_henry_wotton mr_dorian_gray an old oxford friend of mine
i have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were and now you have spoiled everything you have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton stepping forward and extending his hand
my aunt has often spoken to me about you you are one of her favourites and i am afraid one of her victims also
i am in lady_agatha black book at present answered mr_dorian_gray with a funny look of penitence i promised to go to a club in whitechapel with her last tuesday and i really forgot all about it
we were to have played a duet together three duets i believe i dont know what she will say to me i am far too frightened to call
oh i will make your peace with my aunt she is quite devoted to you and i dont think it really matters about your not being there
the audience probably thought it was a duet when aunt lady_agatha sits down to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people
that is very horrid to her and not very nice to me answered mr_dorian_gray laughing lord_henry_wotton looked at him
yes he was certainly wonderfully handsome with his finely curved scarlet lip his frank blue eye his crisp gold hair there was something in his face that made one trust him at once
all the candour of youth was there as well as all youth passionate purity one felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world
no wonder basil_hallward worshipped him you are too charming to go in for philanthropy mr_dorian_gray far too charming
and lord_henry_wotton flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette case the painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready
he was looking worried and when he heard lord_henry_wotton last remark he glanced at him hesitated for a moment and then said harry i want to finish this picture to day
would you think it awfully rude of me if i asked you to go away lord_henry_wotton smiled and looked at mr_dorian_gray
am i to go mr_dorian_gray he asked oh please dont lord_henry_wotton i see that basil_hallward is in one of his sulky moods and i cant bear him when he sulks
besides i want you to tell me why i should not go in for philanthropy i dont know that i shall tell you that mr_dorian_gray
it is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it but i certainly shall not run away now that you have asked me to stop
you dont really mind basil_hallward do you you have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to
basil_hallward bit his lip if mr_dorian_gray wishes it of course you must stay mr_dorian_gray whims are laws to everybody except himself
lord_henry_wotton took up his hat and gloves you are very pressing basil_hallward but i am afraid i must go
i have promised to meet a man at the orleans good bye mr_dorian_gray come and see me some afternoon in curzon street
i am nearly always at home at five clock write to me when you are coming i should be sorry to miss you
you never open your lip while you are painting and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant
basil_hallward cried mr_dorian_gray if lord_henry_wotton goes i shall go too ask him to stay i insist upon it
it is quite true i never talk when i am working and never listen either and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters
stay harry to oblige mr_dorian_gray and to oblige me said basil_hallward gazing intently at his picture i beg you to stay
but what about my man at the orleans the painter laughed i dont think there will be any difficulty about that
and now mr_dorian_gray get up on the platform and dont move about too much or pay any attention to what lord_henry_wotton says
sit down again harry he has a very bad influence over all his friend with the single exception of myself
mr_dorian_gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young greek martyr and made a little moue of discontent to lord_henry_wotton to whom he had rather taken a fancy
he was so unlike basil_hallward they made a delightful contrast and he had such a beautiful voice after a few moment he said to him have you really a very bad influence lord_henry_wotton
as bad as basil_hallward says there is no such thing as a good influence mr_dorian_gray all influence is immoral immoral from the scientific point of view
why because to influence a person is to give him one own soul he does not think his natural thoughts or burn with his natural passion
he becomes an echo of some one else music an actor of a part that has not been written for him
his virtues are not real to him his sin if there are such thing as sin are borrowed the aim of life is self development
to realize one nature perfectly that is what each of us is here for people are afraid of themselves nowadays they have forgotten the highest of all duties the duty that one owes to one self
of course they are charitable they feed the hungry and clothe the beggar but their own soul starve and are naked
the terror of society which is the basis of morals the terror of god which is the secret of religion these are the two thing that govern us
just turn your head a little more to the right mr_dorian_gray like a good boy said the painter deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad face that he had never seen there before
and yet continued lord_henry_wotton in his low musical voice and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him and that he had even in his eton day i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely were to give form to every feeling expression to every thought reality to every dream
i believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism and return to the hellenic ideal to something finer richer than the hellenic ideal it may be
courage has gone out of our race perhaps we never really had it and yet but the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself
the mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self denial that mars our life we are punished for our refusals
every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us the body sin once and has done with its sin for action is a mode of purification
nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure or the luxury of a regret the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it
resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the thing it has forbidden to itself with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful
it has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain it is in the brain and the brain only that the great sin of the world take place also
you mr_dorian_gray you yourself with your rose red youth and your rose white boyhood you have had passion that have made you afraid thoughts that have filled you with terror day dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame stop faltered mr_dorian_gray stop
you bewilder me i dont know what to say there is some answer to you but i cannot find it dont speak
let me think or rather let me try not to think for nearly ten minutes he stood there motionless with parted lip and eye strangely bright
he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself
the few word that basil_hallward friend had said to him word spoken by chance no doubt and with wilful paradox in them had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses
music had stirred him like that music had troubled him many time but music was not articulate it was not a new world but rather another chaos that it created in us
word mere word how terrible they were how clear and vivid and cruel one could not escape from them and yet what a subtle magic there was in them
they seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless thing and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute
mere word was there anything so real as word yes there had been thing in his boyhood that he had not understood
he understood them now life suddenly became fiery coloured to him it seemed to him that he had been walking in fire
why had he not known it with his subtle smile lord_henry_wotton watched him he knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing
he was amazed at the sudden impression that his word had produced and remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before he wondered whether mr_dorian_gray was passing through a similar experience
he felt intensely interested he had merely shot an arrow into the air had it hit the mark how fascinating the lad was
basil_hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art at any rate comes only from strength
he was unconscious of the silence basil_hallward i am tired of standing cried mr_dorian_gray suddenly i must go out and sit in the garden
the air is stifling here my dear fellow i am so sorry when i am painting i cant think of anything else
but you never sat better you were perfectly still and i have caught the effect i wanted the half parted lip and the bright look in the eye
i dont know what harry has been saying to you but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression
i suppose he has been paying you compliments you mustnt believe a word that he says he has certainly not been paying me compliments
perhaps that is the reason that i dont believe anything he has told me you know you believe it all said lord_henry_wotton looking at him with his dreamy languorous eye
i will go out to the garden with you it is horribly hot in the studio basil_hallward let us have something iced to drink something with strawberries in it
certainly harry just touch the bell and when parker comes i will tell him what you want i have got to work up this background so i will join you later on
dont keep mr_dorian_gray too long i have never been in better form for painting than i am to day this is going to be my masterpiece
lord_henry_wotton went out to the garden and found mr_dorian_gray burying his face in the great cool lilac blossoms feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine
it is my masterpiece as it stands he came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder
you are quite right to do that he murmured nothing can cure the soul but the sense just as nothing can cure the sense but the soul
the lad started and drew back he was bareheaded and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads
there was a look of fear in his eye such as people have when they are suddenly awakened his finely chiselled nostrils quivered and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lip and left them trembling
yes continued lord_henry_wotton that is one of the great secret of life to cure the soul by means of the sense and the sense by means of the soul
you are a wonderful creation you know more than you think you know just as you know less than you want to know
mr_dorian_gray frowned and turned his head away he could not help liking the tall graceful young man who was standing by him
his romantic olive coloured face and worn expression interested him there was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating
his cool white flowerlike hand even had a curious charm they moved as he spoke like music and seemed to have a language of their own
but he felt afraid of him and ashamed of being afraid why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself
he had known basil_hallward for months but the friendship between them had never altered him suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life mystery
and yet what was there to be afraid of he was not a schoolboy or a girl it was absurd to be frightened
parker has brought out the drinks and if you stay any longer in this glare you will be quite spoiled and basil_hallward will never paint you again
let us go and sit in the shade said lord_henry_wotton you really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt
it would be unbecoming what can it matter cried mr_dorian_gray laughing as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden
it should matter everything to you mr_dorian_gray why because you have the most marvellous youth and youth is the one thing worth having
some day when you are old and wrinkled and ugly when thought has seared your forehead with its lines and passion branded your lip with its hideous fires you will feel it you will feel it terribly
i dont feel that lord_henry_wotton no you dont feel it now now wherever you go you charm the world
will it always be so you have a wonderfully beautiful face mr_dorian_gray dont frown you have and beauty is a form of genius is higher indeed than genius as it needs no explanation
it is of the great facts of the world like sunlight or spring time or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon
it cannot be questioned it has its divine right of sovereignty it makes princes of those who have it you smile
ah when you have lost it you wont smile people say sometimes that beauty is only superficial that may be so but at least it is not so superficial as thought is
to me beauty is the wonder of wonders it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances the true mystery of the world is the visible not the invisible
yes mr_dorian_gray the gods have been good to you but what the gods give they quickly take away you have only a few year in which to live really perfectly and fully
when your youth goes your beauty will go with it and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats
every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful time is jealous of you and wars against your lilies and your roses
dont squander the gold of your day listening to the tedious trying to improve the hopeless failure or giving away your life to the ignorant the common and the vulgar
you will become sallow and hollow cheeked and dull eyed you will suffer horribly ah realize your youth while you have it these are the sickly aims the false ideals of our age
live live the wonderful life that is in you let nothing be lost upon you be always searching for new sensations
be afraid of nothing a new hedonism that is what our century wants you might be its visible symbol with your personality there is nothing you could not do
the world belongs to you for a season the moment i met you i saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are of what you really might be
there was so much in you that charmed me that i felt i must tell you something about yourself i thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted
for there is such a little time that your youth will last such a little time the common hill flowers wither but they blossom again
in a month there will be purple stars on the clematis and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars
the laburnum will be as yellow next june as it is now but we never get back our youth the pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish
we degenerate into hideous puppets haunted by the memory of the passion of which we were too much afraid and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to
our limbs fail our sense rot youth youth there is absolutely nothing in the world but youth mr_dorian_gray listened open eyed and wondering
the spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel a furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment
he watched it with that strange interest in trivial thing that we try to develop when thing of high import make us afraid or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield
then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms after a time the bee flew away
he saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a tyrian convolvulus the flower seemed to quiver and then swayed gently to and fro
suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs for them to come in they turned to each other and smiled
i am waiting he cried do come in the light is quite perfect and you can bring your drinks
two green and white butterflies fluttered past them and in the pear tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing
they rose up and sauntered down the walk together you are glad you have met me mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton looking at him
yes i am glad now i wonder shall i always be glad always that is a dreadful word it makes me shudder when i hear it
woman are so fond of using it they spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever it is a meaningless word too
the only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer as they entered the studio mr_dorian_gray put his hand upon lord_henry_wotton arm
in that case let our friendship be a caprice he murmured flushing at his own boldness then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose
the sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness except when now and then basil_hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance
lord_henry_wotton flung himself into a large wicker arm chair and watched him in the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden
basil_hallward stopped painting looked for a long time at mr_dorian_gray and then for a long time at the picture biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning
the heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything after about a quarter of an hour it is quite finished he cried at last and stooping down
he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the left hand corner of the canvas lord_henry_wotton came over and examined the picture
it was certainly a wonderful work of art and a wonderful likeness as well my dear fellow i congratulate you most warmly he said
it is the finest portrait of modern time mr_dorian_gray come over and look at yourself the lad started as if awakened from some dream
is it really finished he murmured stepping down from the platform quite finished said the painter and you have sat splendidly to day
i am awfully obliged to you that is entirely due to me broke in lord_henry_wotton isnt it mr_dorian_gray mr_dorian_gray made no answer but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it
when he saw it he drew back and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure a look of joy came into his eye as if he had recognized himself for the first time
he stood there motionless and in wonder dimly conscious that basil_hallward was speaking to him but not catching the meaning of his word
the sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation he had never felt it before basil_hallward compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship
he had listened to them laughed at them forgotten them they had not influenced his nature then had come lord_henry_wotton with his strange panegyric on youth his terrible warning of its brevity
that had stirred him at the time and now as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness the full reality of the description flashed across him
yes there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen his eye dim and colourless the grace of his figure broken and deformed
the scarlet would pass away from his lip and the gold steal from his hair the life that was to make his soul would mar his body
as he thought of it a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver
he would become dreadful hideous and uncouth his eye deepened into amethyst and across them came a mist of tears he felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart
dont you like it cried basil_hallward at last stung a little by the lad silence not understanding what it meant
of course he likes it said lord_henry_wotton who wouldnt like it it is one of the greatest thing in modern art
i will give you anything you like to ask for it i must have it it is not my property harry
whose property is it mr_dorian_gray of course answered the painter he is a very lucky fellow
how sad it is murmured mr_dorian_gray with his eye still fixed upon his own portrait how sad it is
i shall grow old and horrible and dreadful but this picture will remain always young it will never be older than this particular day of june
if it were only the other way if it were i who was to be always young and the picture that was to grow old
for that for that i would give everything yes there is nothing in the whole world i would not give i would give my soul for that
you would hardly care for such an arrangement basil_hallward cried lord_henry_wotton laughing it would be rather hard lines on your work
i should object very strongly harry said basil_hallward mr_dorian_gray turned and looked at him i believe you would basil_hallward
you like your art better than your friend i am no more to you than a green bronze figure hardly as much i dare say
the painter stared in amazement it was so unlike mr_dorian_gray to speak like that what had happened he seemed quite angry
his face was flushed and his cheeks burning yes he continued i am less to you than your ivory hermes or your silver faun
you will like them always how long will you like me till i have my first wrinkle i suppose i know now that when one loses one good look whatever they may be one loses everything
your picture has taught me that lord_henry_wotton is perfectly right youth is the only thing worth having when i find that i am growing old i shall kill myself
basil_hallward turned pale and caught his hand mr_dorian_gray dorian he cried dont talk like that i have never had such a friend as you and i shall never have such another
you are not jealous of material thing are you you who are finer than any of them i am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die
i am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me why should it keep what i must lose every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it
oh if it were only the other way if the picture could change and i could be always what i am now
the hot tears welled into his eye he tore his hand away and flinging himself on the divan he buried his face in the cushions as though he was praying
why did you paint it it will mock me some day mock me horribly this is your doing harry said the painter bitterly
lord_henry_wotton shrugged his shoulders it is the real mr_dorian_gray that is all it is not if it is not what have i to do with it
you should have gone away when i asked you he muttered i stayed when you asked me was lord_henry_wotton answer
harry i cant quarrel with my two best friend at once but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work i have ever done and i will destroy it
what is it but canvas and colour i will not let it come across our three life and mar them
mr_dorian_gray lifted his golden head from the pillow and with pallid face and tear stained eye looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting table that was set beneath the high curtained window
what was he doing there his fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes seeking for something
yes it was for the long palette knife with its thin blade of lithe steel he had found it at last he was going to rip up the canvas
with a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch and rushing over to basil_hallward tore the knife out of his hand and flung it to the end of the studio
i am glad you appreciate my work at last mr_dorian_gray said the painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise
dont basil_hallward dont he cried it would be murder i never thought you would appreciate it
i am in love with it basil_hallward it is part of myself i feel that well as soon as you are dry you shall be varnished and framed and sent home
then you can do what you like with yourself and he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea
you will have tea of course mr_dorian_gray and so will you harry or do you object to such simple pleasure
i adore simple pleasure said lord_henry_wotton they are the last refuge of the complex but i dont like scenes except on the stage
what absurd fellows you are both of you i wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal it was the most premature definition ever given
man is many thing but he is not rational i am glad he is not after all though i wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture
if you let any one have it but me basil_hallward i shall never forgive you cried mr_dorian_gray and i dont allow people to call me a silly boy
you had much better let me have it basil_hallward this silly boy doesnt really want it and i really do
and you know you have been a little silly mr_dorian_gray and that you dont really object to being reminded that you are extremely young
you know the picture is yours mr_dorian_gray i gave it to you before it existed i should have objected very strongly this morning lord_henry_wotton
there came a knock at the door and the butler entered with a laden tea tray and set it down upon a small japanese table
ah this morning you have lived since then there was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted georgian urn
two globe shaped china dishes were brought in by a page mr_dorian_gray went over and poured out the tea the two man sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the covers
i have promised to dine at white but it is only with an old friend so i can send him a wire to say that i am ill or that i am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement
let us go to the theatre to night said lord_henry_wotton there is sure to be something on somewhere i think that would be a rather nice excuse it would have all the surprise of candour
it is such a bore putting on one dress clothes muttered basil_hallward and when one has them on they are so horrid
yes answered lord_henry_wotton dreamily the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable it is so sombre so depressing sin is the only real colour element left in modern life
you really must not say thing like that before mr_dorian_gray harry before which mr_dorian_gray the one who is pouring out tea for us or the one in the picture
before either i should like to come to the theatre with you lord_henry_wotton said the lad then you shall come and you will come too basil_hallward wont you
i cant really i would sooner not i have a lot of work to do well then you and i will go alone mr_dorian_gray
i should like that awfully the painter bit his lip and walked over cup in hand to the picture
i shall stay with the real mr_dorian_gray he said sadly is it the real mr_dorian_gray cried the original of the portrait strolling across to him
am i really like that yes you are just like that how wonderful basil_hallward at least you are like it in appearance
but it will never alter sighed basil_hallward that is something what a fuss people make about fidelity exclaimed lord_henry_wotton
why even in love it is purely a question for physiology it has nothing to do with our own will
young man want to be faithful and are not old man want to be faithless and cannot that is all one can say
dont go to the theatre to night mr_dorian_gray said basil_hallward stop and dine with me i cant basil_hallward why
because i have promised lord_henry_wotton to go with him he wont like you the better for keeping your promises
he always breaks his own i beg you not to go mr_dorian_gray laughed and shook his head i entreat you
the lad hesitated and looked over at lord_henry_wotton who was watching them from the tea table with an amused smile
i must go basil_hallward he answered very well said basil_hallward and he went over and laid down his cup on the tray
it is rather late and as you have to dress you had better lose no time good bye harry good bye mr_dorian_gray
come and see me soon come to morrow certainly you wont forget no of course not cried mr_dorian_gray and harry
yes basil_hallward remember what i asked you when we were in the garden this morning i have forgotten it i trust you
i wish i could trust myself said lord_henry_wotton laughing come mr_dorian_gray my hansom is outside and i can drop you at your own place
as the door closed behind them the painter flung himself down on a sofa and a look of pain came into his face
lord_henry_wotton strolled from curzon street over to the albany to call on his uncle lord fermor a genial if somewhat rough mannered old bachelor whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him but who was considered generous by society as he fed the people who amused him
his father had been our ambassador at madrid when isabella was young and prim unthought of but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the embassy at paris a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth his indolence the good english of his dispatches and his inordinate passion for pleasure
the son who had been his father secretary had resigned along with his chief somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time and on succeeding some months later to the title had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing
he had two large town house but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble and took most of his meals at his club
he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth
in politics he was a tory except when the tories were in office during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of radicals
he was a hero to his valet who bullied him and a terror to most of his relations whom he bullied in turn
good bye basil_hallward it has been a most interesting afternoon chapter at half past twelve next day only england could have produced him and he always said that the country was going to the dogs
when lord_henry_wotton entered the room he found his uncle sitting in a rough shooting coat smoking a cheroot and grumbling over the time
his principles were out of date but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices well harry said the old gentleman what brings you out so early
i thought you dandies never got up till two and were not visible till five pure family affection i assure you uncle george
i want to get something out of you money i suppose said lord fermor making a wry face well sit down and tell me all about it
young people nowadays imagine that money is everything yes murmured lord_henry_wotton settling his button hole in his coat and when they grow older they know it
but i dont want money it is only people who pay their bills who want that uncle george and i never pay mine
credit is the capital of a younger son and one life charmingly upon it besides i always deal with dartmoor tradesmen and consequently they never bother me
well i can tell you anything that is in an english blue book harry although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense
what i want is information not useful information of course useless information when i was in the diplomatic thing were much better
but i hear they let them in now by examination what can you expect examinations sir are pure humbug from beginning to end
if a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough and if he is not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him
mr_dorian_gray does not belong to blue book uncle george said lord_henry_wotton languidly mr_dorian_gray who is he
asked lord fermor knitting his bushy white eyebrows that is what i have come to learn uncle george or rather i know who he is
he is the last lord kelso grandson his mother was a devereux lady margaret devereux i want you to tell me about his mother
what was she like whom did she marry you have known nearly everybody in your time so you might have known her
i am very much interested in mr_dorian_gray at present i have only just met him kelso grandson echoed the old gentleman
she was an extraordinarily beautiful girl margaret devereux and made all the man frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow a mere nobody sir a subaltern in a foot regiment or something of that kind
kelso grandson of course i knew his mother intimately i believe i was at her christening certainly i remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday
the poor chap was killed in a duel at spa a few months after the marriage there was an ugly story about it
they said kelso got some rascally adventurer some belgian brute to insult his son in law in public paid him sir to do it paid him and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon
the thing was hushed up but egad kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards he brought his daughter back with him i was told and she never spoke to him again
oh yes it was a bad business the girl died too died within a year so she left a son did she
i had forgotten that what sort of boy is he if he is like his mother he must be a good looking chap
he is very good looking assented lord_henry_wotton i hope he will fall into proper hand continued the old man
he should have a pot of money waiting for him if kelso did the right thing by him his mother had money too
all the selby property came to her through her grandfather her grandfather hated kelso thought him a mean dog he was too
came to madrid once when i was there egad i was ashamed of him the queen used to ask me about the english noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares
they made quite a story of it i didnt dare show my face at court for a month i hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies
i dont know answered lord_henry_wotton i fancy that the boy will be well off he is not of age yet
he has selby i know he told me so and his mother was very beautiful margaret devereux was one of the loveliest creatures i ever saw harry
what on earth induced her to behave as she did i never could understand she could have married anybody she chose
carlington was mad after her she was romantic though all the woman of that family were the man were a poor lot but egad
the woman were wonderful carlington went on his knees to her told me so himself she laughed at him and there wasnt a girl in london at the time who wasnt after him
and by the way harry talking about silly marriages what is this humbug your father tells me about dartmoor wanting to marry an american
aint english girl good enough for him it is rather fashionable to marry americans just now uncle george i ll back english woman against the world harry said lord fermor striking the table with his fist
the betting is on the americans they dont last i am told muttered his uncle a long engagement exhausts them but they are capital at a steeplechase
they take thing flying i dont think dartmoor has a chance who are her people grumbled the old gentleman
american girl are as clever at concealing their parents as english woman are at concealing their past he said rising to go
has she got any lord_henry_wotton shook his head they are pork packers i suppose i hope so uncle george for dartmoor sake
i am told that pork packing is the most lucrative profession in america after politics is she pretty she behaves as if she was beautiful
most american woman do it is the secret of their charm why cant these american woman stay in their own country
they are always telling us that it is the paradise for woman it is that is the reason why like eve they are so excessively anxious to get out of it said lord_henry_wotton
good bye uncle george i shall be late for lunch if i stop any longer thanks for giving me the information i wanted
i always like to know everything about my new friend and nothing about my old one where are you lunching harry
at aunt lady_agatha i have asked myself and mr_dorian_gray he is her latest protege humph tell your aunt lady_agatha harry not to bother me any more with her charity appeals
i am sick of them why the good woman thinks that i have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads
all right uncle george i ll tell her but it wont have any effect philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity
it is their distinguishing characteristic the old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant lord_henry_wotton passed up the low arcade into burlington street and turned his steps in the direction of berkeley square
crudely as it had been told to him it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange almost modern romance
so that was the story of mr_dorian_gray parentage a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion a few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous treacherous crime
months of voiceless agony and then a child born in pain the mother snatched away by death the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man
yes it was an interesting background it posed the lad made him more perfect as it were behind every exquisite thing that existed there was something tragic
and how charming he had been at dinner the night before as with startled eye and lip parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face
world had to be in travail that the meanest flower might blow talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin
he answered to every touch and thrill of the bow there was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence no other activity was like it
to project one soul into some gracious form and let it tarry there for a moment to hear one own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth to convey one temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume there was a real joy in that perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own an age grossly carnal in its pleasure and grossly common in its aims
he was a marvellous type too this lad whom by so curious a chance he had met in basil_hallward studio or could be fashioned into a marvellous type at any rate
grace was his and the white purity of boyhood and beauty such as old greek marbles kept for us there was nothing that one could not do with him
he could be made a titan or a toy what a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade
the new manner in art the fresh mode of looking at life suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland and walked unseen in open field suddenly showing herself dryadlike and not afraid because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful thing revealed the mere shapes and patterns of thing becoming as it were refined and gaining a kind of symbolical value as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real how strange it all was
and basil_hallward from a psychological point of view how interesting he was he remembered something like it in history was it not plato that artist in thought who had first analyzed it
was it not buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet sequence but in our own century it was strange
yes he would try to be to mr_dorian_gray what without knowing it the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait
he would seek to dominate him had already indeed half done so he would make that wonderful spirit his own there was something fascinating in this son of love and death
suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the house he found that he had passed his aunt some distance and smiling to himself turned back
when he entered the somewhat sombre hall the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch he gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the dining room
he invented a facile excuse and having taken the vacant seat next to her looked round to see who was there
late as usual harry cried his aunt shaking her head at him mr_dorian_gray bowed to him shyly from the end of the table a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek
opposite was the duchess of harley a lady of admirable good nature and good temper much liked by every one who knew her and of those ample architectural proportions that in woman who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness
next to her sat on her right sir thomas burdon a radical member of parliament who followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the best cooks dining with the tories and thinking with the liberals in accordance with a wise and well known rule
the post on her left was occupied by mr_erskine of treadley an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture who had fallen however into bad habits of silence having as he explained once to lady_agatha said everything that he had to say before he was thirty
his own neighbour was mrs vandeleur one of his aunt oldest friend a perfect saint amongst woman but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn book
fortunately for him she had on the other side lord faudel a most intelligent middle aged mediocrity as bald as a ministerial statement in the house of commons with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error as he remarked once himself that all really good people fall into and from which none of them ever quite escape
we are talking about poor dartmoor lord_henry_wotton cried the duchess nodding pleasantly to him across the table do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person
i believe she has made up her mind to propose to him duchess how dreadful exclaimed lady_agatha really some one should interfere
i am told on excellent authority that her father keeps an american dry goods store said sir thomas burdon looking supercilious
my uncle has already suggested pork packing sir thomas dry goods what are american dry goods asked the duchess raising her large hand in wonder and accentuating the verb
american novels answered lord_henry_wotton helping himself to some quail the duchess looked puzzled dont mind him my dear whispered lady_agatha
he never means anything that he says when america was discovered said the radical member and he began to give some wearisome facts
like all people who try to exhaust a subject he exhausted his listeners the duchess sighed and exercised her privilege of interruption
i wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all she exclaimed really our girl have no chance nowadays
perhaps after all america never has been discovered said mr_erskine i myself would say that it had merely been detected
it is most unfair oh but i have seen specimens of the inhabitants answered the duchess vaguely i must confess that most of them are extremely pretty
and they dress well too they get all their dresses in paris i wish i could afford to do the same
they say that when good americans die they go to paris chuckled sir thomas who had a large wardrobe of humour cast off clothes
really and where do bad americans go to when they die inquired the duchess they go to america murmured lord_henry_wotton
sir thomas frowned i am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country he said to lady_agatha
i have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors who in such matters are extremely civil i assure you that it is an education to visit it
but must we really see chicago in order to be educated asked mr_erskine plaintively i dont feel up to the journey
sir thomas waved his hand mr_erskine of treadley has the world on his shelves we practical man like to see thing not to read about them
the americans are an extremely interesting people they are absolutely reasonable i think that is their distinguishing characteristic yes mr_erskine an absolutely reasonable people
i assure you there is no nonsense about the americans how dreadful cried lord_henry_wotton i can stand brute force but brute reason is quite unbearable
there is something unfair about its use it is hitting below the intellect i do not understand you said sir thomas growing rather red
i do lord_henry_wotton murmured mr_erskine with a smile paradoxes are all very well in their way rejoined the baronet
was that a paradox asked mr_erskine i did not think so perhaps it was well the way of paradoxes is the way of truth
to test reality we must see it on the tight rope when the verities become acrobats we can judge them
dear me said lady_agatha how you man argue i am sure i never can make out what you are talking about
oh harry i am quite vexed with you why do you try to persuade our nice mr_dorian_gray to give up the east end
i want him to play to me cried lord_henry_wotton smiling and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance
i assure you he would be quite invaluable they would love his playing but they are so unhappy in whitechapel continued lady_agatha
i can sympathize with everything except suffering said lord_henry_wotton shrugging his shoulders i cannot sympathize with that it is too ugly too horrible too distressing
there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain one should sympathize with the colour the beauty the joy of life
the less said about life sores the better still the east end is a very important problem remarked sir thomas with a grave shake of the head
quite so answered the young lord it is the problem of slavery and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves
the politician looked at him keenly what change do you propose then he asked lord_henry_wotton laughed i dont desire to change anything in england except the weather he answered
but as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over expenditure of sympathy i would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight
the advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional
i am quite content with philosophic contemplation but we have such grave responsibilities ventured mrs vandeleur timidly terribly grave echoed lady_agatha
lord_henry_wotton looked over at mr_erskine humanity takes itself too seriously it is the world original sin if the caveman had known how to laugh history would have been different
i have always felt rather guilty when i came to see your dear aunt for i take no interest at all in the east end
you are really very comforting warbled the duchess for the future i shall be able to look her in the face without a blush
a blush is very becoming duchess remarked lord_henry_wotton only when one is young she answered when an old woman like myself blushes it is a very bad sign
ah lord_henry_wotton i wish you would tell me how to become young again he thought for a moment
can you remember any great error that you committed in your early day duchess he asked looking at her across the table
a great many i fear she cried then commit them over again he said gravely to get back one youth one has merely to repeat one follies
a delightful theory she exclaimed i must put it into practice a dangerous theory came from sir thomas tight lip
lady_agatha shook her head but could not help being amused mr_erskine listened yes he continued that is one of the great secret of life
nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense and discover when it is too late that the only thing one never regrets are one mistakes
he played with the idea and grew wilful tossed it into the air and transformed it let it escape and recaptured it made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox
the praise of folly as he went on soared into a philosophy and philosophy herself became young and catching the mad music of pleasure wearing one might fancy her wine stained robe and wreath of ivy danced like a bacchante over the hills of life and mocked the slow silenus for being sober
trod the huge press at which wise omar sits till the seething grape juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles or crawled in red foam over the vat black dripping sloping sides
a laugh ran round the table facts fled before her like frightened forest thing her white foot it was an extraordinary improvisation
he felt that the eye of mr_dorian_gray were fixed on him and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination
mr_dorian_gray never took his gaze off him but sat like one under a spell smiles chasing each other over his lip and wonder growing grave in his darkening eye
at last liveried in the costume of the age reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting
he was brilliant fantastic irresponsible he charmed his listeners out of themselves and they followed his pipe laughing she wrung her hand in mock despair
i have to call for my husband at the club to take him to some absurd meeting at willis room where he is going to be in the chair
how annoying she cried i must go if i am late he is sure to be furious and i couldnt have a scene in this bonnet
it is far too fragile a harsh word would ruin it no i must go dear lady_agatha good bye lord_henry_wotton you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing
i am sure i dont know what to say about your views you must come and dine with us some night
ah that is very nice and very wrong of you she cried so mind you come and she swept out of the room followed by lady_agatha and the other ladies
when lord_henry_wotton had sat down again mr_erskine moved round and taking a chair close to him placed his hand upon his arm
tuesday are you disengaged tuesday for you i would throw over anybody duchess said lord_henry_wotton with a bow
you talk book away he said why dont you write one i am too fond of reading book to care to write them mr_erskine
i should like to write a novel certainly a novel that would be as lovely as a persian carpet and as unreal
but there is no literary public in england for anything except newspapers primers and encyclopaedias of all people in the world the english have the least sense of the beauty of literature
i fear you are right answered mr_erskine i myself used to have literary ambitions but i gave them up long ago
and now my dear young friend if you will allow me to call you so may i ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch
in fact i consider you extremely dangerous and if anything happens to our good duchess we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible
i quite forget what i said smiled lord_henry_wotton was it all very bad very bad indeed but i should like to talk to you about life
some day when you are tired of london come down to treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable burgundy
the generation into which i was born was tedious i am fortunate enough to possess i shall be charmed a visit to treadley would be a great privilege
it has a perfect host and a perfect library you will complete it answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow
and now i must bid good bye to your excellent aunt i am due at the athenaeum it is the hour when we sleep there
all of you mr_erskine forty of us in forty arm chair we are practising for an english academy of letters
lord_henry_wotton laughed and rose i am going to the park he cried as he was passing out of the door mr_dorian_gray touched him on the arm
let me come with you he murmured but i thought you had promised basil_hallward to go and see him answered lord_henry_wotton
i would sooner come with you yes i feel i must come with you do let me and you will promise to talk to me all the time
no one talks so wonderfully as you do ah i have talked quite enough for to day said lord_henry_wotton smiling
all i want now is to look at life you may come and look at it with me if you care to
chapter one afternoon a month later mr_dorian_gray was reclining in a luxurious arm chair in the little library of lord_henry_wotton house in mayfair
it was in its way a very charming room with its high panelled wainscoting of olive stained oak its cream coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk long fringed persian rugs
on a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by clodion and beside it lay a copy of les cent nouvelles bound for margaret of valois by clovis eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that queen had selected for her device
some large blue china jars and parrot tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot coloured light of a summer day in london
lord_henry_wotton had not yet come in he was always late on principle his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time
so the lad was looking rather sulky as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of manon lescaut that he had found in one of the book cases
the formal monotonous ticking of the louis quatorze clock annoyed him once or twice he thought of going away at last he heard a step outside and the door opened
how late you are harry he murmured i am afraid it is not harry mr_dorian_gray answered a shrill voice
he glanced quickly round and rose to his foot i beg your pardon i thought you thought it was my husband
it is only his wife you must let me introduce myself i know you quite well by your photographs i think my husband has got seventeen of them
not seventeen lady henry well eighteen then and i saw you with him the other night at the opera
she was a curious woman whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest
she laughed nervously as she spoke and watched him with her vague forget me not eye she was usually in love with somebody and as her passion was never returned she had kept all her illusions
she tried to look picturesque but only succeeded in being untidy her name was victoria and she had a perfect mania for going to church
that was at lohengrin lady henry i think yes it was at dear lohengrin i like wagner music better than anybody
it is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says that is a great advantage dont you think so mr_dorian_gray
the same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lip and her fingers began to play with a long tortoise shell paper knife
mr_dorian_gray smiled and shook his head i am afraid i dont think so lady henry i never talk during music at least during good music
if one hears bad music it is one duty to drown it in conversation ah that is one of harry views isnt it mr_dorian_gray
i always hear harry views from his friend it is the only way i get to know of them but you must not think i dont like good music
i adore it but i am afraid of it it makes me too romantic i have simply worshipped pianists two at a time sometimes harry tells me
i dont know what it is about them perhaps it is that they are foreigners they all are aint they even those that are born in england become foreigners after a time dont they
it is so clever of them and such a compliment to art makes it quite cosmopolitan doesnt it you have never been to any of my parties have you mr_dorian_gray
you must come i cant afford orchids but i spare no expense in foreigners they make one room look so picturesque
but here is harry harry i came in to look for you to ask you something i forget what it was and i found mr_dorian_gray here
we have had such a pleasant chat about music we have quite the same ideas no i think our ideas are quite different
i am charmed my love quite charmed said lord_henry_wotton elevating his dark crescent shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile
but he has been most pleasant i am so glad i ve seen him so sorry i am late mr_dorian_gray
i went to look after a piece of old brocade in wardour street and had to bargain for hours for it
nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing i am afraid i must be going exclaimed lady henry breaking an awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh
i have promised to drive with the duchess good bye mr_dorian_gray good bye harry you are dining out i suppose so am
i dare say my dear said lord_henry_wotton shutting the door behind her as looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain she flitted out of the room leaving a faint odour of frangipanni
i perhaps i shall see you at lady thornbury then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa
never marry a woman with straw coloured hair mr_dorian_gray he said after a few puffs why harry because they are so sentimental
but i like sentimental people never marry at all mr_dorian_gray man marry because they are tired woman because they are curious both are disappointed
i dont think i am likely to marry harry i am too much in love that is one of your aphorisms
i am putting it into practice as i do everything that you say who are you in love with asked lord_henry_wotton after a pause
with an actress said mr_dorian_gray blushing lord_henry_wotton shrugged his shoulders that is a rather commonplace debut
you would not say so if you saw her harry who is she her name is sibyl_vane never heard of her
no one has people will some day however she is a genius my dear boy no woman is a genius
woman are a decorative sex they never have anything to say but they say it charmingly woman represent the triumph of matter over mind just as man represent the triumph of mind over morals
harry how can you my dear mr_dorian_gray it is quite true i am analysing woman at present so i ought to know
the subject is not so abstruse as i thought it was i find that ultimately there are only two kinds of woman the plain and the coloured
the plain woman are very useful if you want to gain a reputation for respectability you have merely to take them down to supper
the other woman are very charming they commit one mistake however they paint in order to try and look young our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly
rouge and esprit used to go together that is all over now as long as a woman can look ten year younger than her own daughter she is perfectly satisfied
as for conversation there are only five woman in london worth talking to and two of these cant be admitted into decent society
however tell me about your genius how long have you known her ah harry your views terrify me never mind that
how long have you known her about three weeks and where did you come across her i will tell you harry but you mustnt be unsympathetic about it
after all it never would have happened if i had not met you you filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life
as i lounged in the park or strolled down piccadilly i used to look at every one who passed me and wonder with a mad curiosity what sort of life they led
for day after i met you something seemed to throb in my veins some of them fascinated me others filled me with terror
there was an exquisite poison in the air i had a passion for sensations well one evening about seven clock i determined to go out in search of some adventure
i felt that this grey monstrous london of ours with its myriads of people its sordid sinners and its splendid sin as you once phrased it must have something in store for me
i remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together about the search for beauty being the real secret of life
i dont know what i expected but i went out and wandered eastward soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares
i fancied a thousand thing the mere danger gave me a sense of delight about half past eight i passed by an absurd little theatre with great flaring gas jets and gaudy play bills
a hideous jew in the most amazing waistcoat i ever beheld in my life was standing at the entrance smoking a vile cigar
he had greasy ringlets and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt have a box my lord
he said when he saw me and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility there was something about him harry that amused me
he was such a monster you will laugh at me i know but i really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage box
to the present day i cant make out why i did so and yet if i hadnt my dear harry if i hadn t
i should have missed the greatest romance of my life i see you are laughing it is horrid of you i am not laughing mr_dorian_gray at least i am not laughing at you
but you should not say the greatest romance of your life you should say the first romance of your life you will always be loved and you will always be in love with love
a grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do that is the one use of the idle classes of a country
dont be afraid there are exquisite thing in store for you this is merely the beginning do you think my nature so shallow cried mr_dorian_gray angrily
no i think your nature so deep how do you mean my dear boy the people who love only once in their life are really the shallow people
what they call their loyalty and their fidelity i call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect simply a confession of failure
faithfulness i must analyse it some day the passion for property is in it there are many thing that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up
but i dont want to interrupt you go on with your story well i found myself seated in a horrid little private box with a vulgar drop scene staring me in the face
i looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house it was a tawdry affair all cupids and cornucopias like a third rate wedding cake
the gallery and pit were fairly full but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty and there was hardly a person in what i suppose they called the dress circle
woman went about with oranges and ginger beer and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on it must have been just like the palmy day of the british drama
just like i should fancy and very depressing i began to wonder what on earth i should do when i caught sight of the play bill
what do you think the play was harry i should think the idiot boy or dumb but innocent our fathers used to like that sort of piece i believe
the longer i live mr_dorian_gray the more keenly i feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us
in art as in politics les grandperes ont toujours tort this play was good enough for us harry
i must admit that i was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place
it was romeo and juliet still i felt interested in a sort of way at any rate i determined to wait for the first act
there was a dreadful orchestra presided over by a young hebrew who sat at a cracked piano that nearly drove me away but at last the drop scene was drawn up and the play began
romeo was a stout elderly gentleman with corked eyebrows a husky tragedy voice and a figure like a beer barrel mercutio was almost as bad
he was played by the low comedian who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit
they were both as grotesque as the scenery and that looked as if it had come out of a country booth but juliet
harry imagine a girl hardly seventeen year of age with a little flowerlike face a small greek head with plaited coils of dark brown hair eye that were violet wells of passion lip that were like the petals of a rose
you said to me once that pathos left you unmoved but that beauty mere beauty could fill your eye with tears
she was the loveliest thing i had ever seen in my life i tell you harry i could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me
and her voice i never heard such a voice it was very low at first with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one ear
then it became a little louder and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy in the garden scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing
there were moment later on when it had the wild passion of violins you know how a voice can stir one
your voice and the voice of sibyl_vane are two thing that i shall never forget when i close my eye i hear them and each of them says something different
i dont know which to follow why should i not love her harry i do love her she is everything to me in life
night after night i go to see her play one evening she is rosalind and the next evening she is imogen
i have watched her wandering through the forest of arden disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap
she has been mad and has come into the presence of a guilty king and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of
i have seen her die in the gloom of an italian tomb sucking the poison from her lover lip she has been innocent and the black hand of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat
i have seen her in every age and in every costume ordinary woman never appeal to one imagination they are limited to their century
no glamour ever transfigures them one knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets one can always find them
there is no mystery in any of them they ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea parties in the afternoon
they have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner they are quite obvious but an actress how different an actress is
harry why didnt you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress because i have loved so many of them mr_dorian_gray
oh yes horrid people with dyed hair and painted face dont run down dyed hair and painted face there is an extraordinary charm in them sometimes said lord_henry_wotton
i wish now i had not told you about sibyl_vane you could not have helped telling me mr_dorian_gray all through your life you will tell me everything you do
yes harry i believe that is true i cannot help telling you thing you have a curious influence over me if i ever did a crime i would come and confess it to you
you would understand me people like you the wilful sunbeams of life dont commit crimes mr_dorian_gray but i am much obliged for the compliment all the same
and now tell me reach me the matches like a good boy thanks what are your actual relations with sibyl_vane mr_dorian_gray leaped to his foot with flushed cheeks and burning eye
it is only the sacred thing that are worth touching mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton with a strange touch of pathos in his voice
harry sibyl_vane is sacred but why should you be annoyed i suppose she will belong to you some day
when one is in love one always begins by deceiving one self and one always ends by deceiving others that is what the world calls a romance
on the first night i was at the theatre the horrid old jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her
i was furious with him and told him that juliet had been dead for hundreds of year and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in verona
i think from his blank look of amazement that he was under the impression that i had taken too much champagne or something
you know her at any rate i suppose of course i know her i am not surprised then he asked me if i wrote for any of the newspapers
he seemed terribly disappointed at that and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him and that they were every one of them to be bought
i told him i never even read them i should not wonder if he was quite right there but on the other hand judging from their appearance most of them cannot be at all expensive
well he seemed to think they were beyond his means laughed mr_dorian_gray by this time however the lights were being put out in the theatre and i had to go
he wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended i declined the next night of course i arrived at the place again
when he saw me he made me a low bow and assured me that i was a munificent patron of art
he told me once with an air of pride that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to the bard as he insisted on calling him
he was a most offensive brute though he had an extraordinary passion for shakespeare he seemed to think it a distinction
it was a distinction my dear mr_dorian_gray a great distinction most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life
to have ruined one self over poetry is an honour but when did you first speak to miss sibyl_vane
the third night she had been playing rosalind i could not help going round i had thrown her some flowers and she had looked at me at least i fancied that she had
the old jew was persistent he seemed determined to take me behind so i consented it was curious my not wanting to know her wasnt it
no i dont think so my dear harry why i will tell you some other time now i want to know about the girl
her eye opened wide in exquisite wonder when i told her what i thought of her performance and she seemed quite unconscious of her power
sibyl_vane oh she was so shy and so gentle there is something of a child about her i think we were both rather nervous
the old jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom making elaborate speeches about us both while we stood looking at each other like children
he would insist on calling me my lord so i had to assure sibyl_vane that i was not anything of the kind
she said quite simply to me you look more like a prince i must call you prince_charming upon my word mr_dorian_gray miss sibyl_vane knows how to pay compliments
you dont understand her harry she regarded me merely as a person in a play she knows nothing of life
she life with her mother a faded tired woman who played lady capulet in a sort of magenta dressing wrapper on the first night and look as if she had seen better day
i know that look it depresses me murmured lord_henry_wotton examining his rings the jew wanted to tell me her history but i said it did not interest me
you were quite right there is always something infinitely mean about other people tragedies sibyl_vane is the only thing i care about
what is it to me where she came from from her little head to her little foot she is absolutely and entirely divine
every night of my life i go to see her act and every night she is more marvellous that is the reason i suppose that you never dine with me now
i thought you must have some curious romance on hand you have but it is not quite what i expected
my dear harry we either lunch or sup together every day and i have been to the opera with you several time said mr_dorian_gray opening his blue eye in wonder
you always come dreadfully late well i cant help going to see sibyl_vane play he cried even if it is only for a single act
i get hungry for her presence and when i think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body i am filled with awe
you can dine with me to night mr_dorian_gray cant you he shook his head to night she is imogen he answered and to morrow night she will be juliet
when is she sibyl_vane never i congratulate you how horrid you are she is all the great heroines of the world in one
she is more than an individual you laugh but i tell you she has genius i love her and i must make her love me
you who know all the secret of life tell me how to charm sibyl_vane to love me i want to make romeo jealous
i want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad i want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness to wake their ashes into pain
my god harry how i worship her he was walking up and down the room as he spoke hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks
he was terribly excited lord_henry_wotton watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure how different he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in basil_hallward studio
his nature had developed like a flower had borne blossoms of scarlet flame out of its secret hiding place had crept his soul and desire had come to meet it on the way
and what do you propose to do said lord_henry_wotton at last i want you and basil_hallward to come with me some night and see her act
i have not the slightest fear of the result you are certain to acknowledge her genius then we must get her out of the jew hand
she is bound to him for three year at least for two year and eight months from the present time i shall have to pay him something of course
when all that is settled i shall take a west end theatre and bring her out properly she will make the world as mad as she has made me
she has not merely art consummate art instinct in her but she has personality also and you have often told me that it is personalities not principles that move the age
that would be impossible my dear boy yes she will well what night shall we go let me see
to day is tuesday let us fix to morrow she plays juliet to morrow all right the bristol at eight clock and i will get basil_hallward
not eight harry please half past six we must be there before the curtain rises you must see her in the first act where she meets romeo
half past six what an hour it will be like having a meat tea or reading an english novel it must be seven
no gentleman dines before seven shall you see basil_hallward between this and then or shall i write to him dear basil_hallward
it is rather horrid of me as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame specially designed by himself and though i am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than i am i must admit that i delight in it
i have not laid eye on him for a week perhaps you had better write to him i dont want to see him alone
he says thing that annoy me he gives me good advice lord_henry_wotton smiled people are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves
it is what i call the depth of generosity oh basil_hallward is the best of fellows but he seems to me to be just a bit of a philistine
since i have known you harry i have discovered that basil_hallward my dear boy puts everything that is charming in him into his work
the consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices his principles and his common sense the only artist i have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artist
good artist exist simply in what they make and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are a great poet a really great poet is the most unpoetical of all creatures
but inferior poets are absolutely fascinating the worse their rhymes are the more picturesque they look the mere fact of having published a book of second rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible
i wonder is that really so harry said mr_dorian_gray putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large gold topped bottle that stood on the table
he life the poetry that he cannot write the others write the poetry that they dare not realize it must be if you say it
and now i am off imogen is waiting for me dont forget about to morrow good bye as he left the room lord_henry_wotton heavy eyelids drooped and he began to think
certainly few people had ever interested him so much as mr_dorian_gray and yet the lad mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy
he had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science but the ordinary subject matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import
he was pleased by it it made him a more interesting study and so he had begun by vivisecting himself as he had ended by vivisecting others
it was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure one could not wear over one face a mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams
human life that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating compared to it there was nothing else of any value there were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them
there were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature and yet what a great reward one received
to note the curious hard logic of passion and the emotional coloured life of the intellect to observe where they met and where they separated at what point they were in unison and at what point they were at discord
how wonderful the whole world became to one there was a delight in that what matter what the cost was one could never pay too high a price for any sensation
he was conscious and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eye that it was through certain word of his musical word said with musical utterance that mr_dorian_gray soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her
ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secret but to the few to the elect the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away
sometimes this was the effect of art and chiefly of the art of literature which dealt immediately with the passion and the intellect
but now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art was indeed in its way a real work of art life having its elaborate masterpieces just as poetry has or sculpture or painting
to a large extent the lad was his own creation he had made him premature that was something yes the lad was premature
he was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring the pulse and passion of youth were in him but he was becoming self conscious
it was delightful to watch him with his beautiful face and his beautiful soul he was a thing to wonder at
he was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play whose joy seem to be remote from one but whose sorrows stir one sense of beauty and whose wounds are like red roses
it was no matter how it all ended or was destined to end soul and body body and soul how mysterious they were
there was animalism in the soul and the body had its moment of spirituality the sense could refine and the intellect could degrade
who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased or the psychical impulse began how shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists
and yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin
or was the body really in the soul as giordano bruno thought the separation of spirit from matter was a mystery and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also
he began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us
as it was we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others experience was of no ethical value it was merely the name man gave to their mistakes
moralists had as a rule regarded it as a mode of warning had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid
all that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past and that the sin we had done once and with loathing we would do many time and with joy
it was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passion and certainly mr_dorian_gray was a subject made to his hand and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results
but there was no motive power in experience it was as little of an active cause as conscience itself his sudden mad love for sibyl_vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest
there was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it curiosity and the desire for new experiences yet it was not a simple but rather a very complex passion
what there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense and was for that very reason all the more dangerous
it was the passion about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious
while lord_henry_wotton sat dreaming on these thing a knock came to the door and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner
it often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves he got up and looked out into the street
the sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper window of the house opposite the panes glowed like plates of heated metal
the sky above was like a faded rose he thought of his friend young fiery coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end
when he arrived home about half past twelve clock he saw a telegram lying on the hall table he opened it and found it was from mr_dorian_gray
it was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to sibyl_vane chapter mother mother i am so happy
whispered the girl burying her face in the lap of the faded tired looking woman who with back turned to the shrill intrusive light was sitting in the one arm chair that their dingy sitting room contained
i am so happy she repeated and you must be happy too mrs vane winced and put her thin bismuth whitened hand on her daughter head
happy she echoed i am only happy sibyl_vane when i see you act you must not think of anything but your acting
mr isaacs has been very good to us and we owe him money the girl looked up and pouted
money mother she cried what does money matter love is more than money mr isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for james_vane
he is not a gentleman mother and i hate the way he talks to me said the girl rising to her foot and going over to the window
you must not forget that sibyl_vane fifty pounds is a very large sum mr isaacs has been most considerate
i dont know how we could manage without him answered the elder woman querulously sibyl_vane tossed her head and laughed
we dont want him any more mother prince_charming rules life for us now then she paused a rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks
quick breath parted the petals of her lip they trembled some southern wind of passion swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress
i love him she said simply foolish child foolish child was the parrot phrase flung in answer the waving of crooked false jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the word
her eye caught the melody and echoed it in radiance then closed for a moment as though to hide their secret
the girl laughed again the joy of a caged bird was in her voice when they opened the mist of a dream had passed across them
thin lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair hinted at prudence quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense
she did not listen she was free in her prison of passion her prince prince_charming was with her she had called on memory to remake him
she had sent her soul to search for him and it had brought him back his kiss burned again upon her mouth
her eyelids were warm with his breath then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery this young man might be rich
if so marriage should be thought of against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning the arrows of craft shot by her
she saw the thin lip moving and smiled suddenly she felt the need to speak the wordy silence troubled her
mother mother she cried why does he love me so much i know why i love him i love him because he is like what love himself should be
but what does he see in me i am not worthy of him and yet why i cannot tell though i feel so much beneath him i dont feel humble
the elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks and her dry lip twitched with a spasm of pain
i feel proud terribly proud mother did you love my father as i love prince_charming sybil rushed to her flung her arm round her neck and kissed her
forgive me mother i know it pains you to talk about our father but it only pains you because you loved him so much
dont look so sad i am as happy to day as you were twenty year ago ah let me be happy for ever
my child you are far too young to think of falling in love besides what do you know of this young man
the whole thing is most inconvenient and really when james_vane is going away to australia and i have so much to think of i must say that you should have shown more consideration
you dont even know his name however as i said before if he is rich ah mother mother let me be happy
mrs vane glanced at her and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage player clasped her in her arm
at this moment the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room he was thick set of figure and his hand and foot were large and somewhat clumsy in movement
he was not so finely bred as his sister one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them
mrs vane fixed her eye on him and intensified her smile she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience
she felt sure that the tableau was interesting you might keep some of your kisses for me sibyl_vane i think said the lad with a good natured grumble
ah but you dont like being kissed jim she cried you are a dreadful old bear and she ran across the room and hugged him
james_vane looked into his sister face with tenderness i want you to come out with me for a walk sibyl_vane
my son dont say such dreadful thing murmured mrs vane taking up a tawdry theatrical dress with a sigh and beginning to patch it
i dont suppose i shall ever see this horrid london again i am sure i dont want to she felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group
it would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation why not mother i mean it you pain me my son
i believe there is no society of any kind in the colonies nothing that i would call society so when you have made your fortune you must come back and assert yourself in london
i trust you will return from australia in a position of affluence society muttered the lad i dont want to know anything about that
i should like to make some money to take you and sibyl_vane off the stage i hate it oh jim said sibyl_vane laughing how unkind of you
i was afraid you were going to say good bye to some of your friend to tom hardy who gave you that hideous pipe or ned langton who makes fun of you for smoking it
but are you really going for a walk with me that will be nice it is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon
where shall we go let us go to the park i am too shabby he answered frowning only swell people go to the park
nonsense jim she whispered stroking the sleeve of his coat he hesitated for a moment very well he said at last but dont be too long dressing
she danced out of the door one could hear her singing as she ran upstairs her little foot pattered overhead
he walked up and down the room two or three time then he turned to the still figure in the chair
mother are my thing ready he asked quite ready james_vane she answered keeping her eye on her work
for some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers
her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eye met she used to wonder if he suspected anything the silence for he made no other observation became intolerable to her
she began to complain woman defend themselves by attacking just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders i hope you will be contented james_vane with your sea faring life she said
you must remember that it is your own choice you might have entered a solicitor office solicitors are a very respectable class and in the country often dine with the best families
i hate offices and i hate clerks he replied but you are quite right i have chosen my own life
all i say is watch over sibyl_vane dont let her come to any harm mother you must watch over her james_vane you really talk very strangely
of course i watch over sibyl_vane i hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her
is that right what about that you are speaking about thing you dont understand james_vane in the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention
i myself used to receive many bouquets at one time that was when acting was really understood as for sibyl_vane i do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not
but there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman he is always most polite to me
besides he has the appearance of being rich and the flowers he sends are lovely you dont know his name though said the lad harshly
no answered his mother with a placid expression in her face he has not yet revealed his real name
i think it is quite romantic of him he is probably a member of the aristocracy james_vane bit his lip
watch over sibyl_vane mother he cried watch over her my son you distress me very much sibyl_vane is always under my special care
of course if this gentleman is wealthy there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him i trust he is one of the aristocracy
he has all the appearance of it i must say it might be a most brilliant marriage for sibyl_vane they would make a charming couple
his good look are really quite remarkable everybody notices them the lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window pane with his coarse fingers
he had just turned round to say something when the door opened and sibyl_vane ran in how serious you both are
she cried what is the matter nothing he answered i suppose one must be serious sometimes good bye mother i will have my dinner at five clock
everything is packed except my shirts so you need not trouble good bye my son she answered with a bow of strained stateliness
she was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her and there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid
kiss me mother said the girl her flowerlike lip touched the withered cheek and warmed its frost my child
my child cried mrs vane looking up to the ceiling in search of an imaginary gallery come sibyl_vane said her brother impatiently
the passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who in coarse ill fitting clothes was in the company of such a graceful refined looking girl
he hated his mother affectations they went out into the flickering wind blown sunlight and strolled down the dreary euston road he was like a common gardener walking with a rose
jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger he had that dislike of being stared at which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace
she was thinking of prince_charming and that she might think of him all the more she did not talk of him but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail about the gold he was certain to find about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked red shirted bushrangers
sibyl_vane however was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing her love was trembling in laughter on her lip for he was not to remain a sailor or a supercargo or whatever he was going to be
fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship with the hoarse hump backed waves trying to get in and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands
he was to leave the vessel at melbourne bid a polite good bye to the captain and go off at once to the gold fields
oh no a sailor existence was dreadful before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold
the largest nugget that had ever been discovered and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen
the bushrangers were to attack them three time and be defeated with immense slaughter or no he was not to go to the gold fields at all
he was to be a nice sheep farmer and one evening as he was riding home he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse and give chase and rescue her
of course she would fall in love with him and he with her and they would get married and come home and live in an immense house in london
they were horrid place where man got intoxicated and shot each other in bar room and used bad language yes there were delightful thing in store for him
but he must be very good and not lose his temper or spend his money foolishly she was only a year older than he was but she knew so much more of life
he must be sure also to write to her by every mail and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep
god was very good and would watch over him she would pray for him too and in a few year he would come back quite rich and happy
the lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer he was heart sick at leaving home yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose
inexperienced though he was he had still a strong sense of the danger of sibyl_vane position this young dandy who was making love to her could mean her no good
he was a gentleman and he hated him for that hated him through some curious race instinct for which he could not account and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him
he was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother nature and in that saw infinite peril for sibyl_vane and sibyl_vane happiness
he had something on his mind to ask of her something that he had brooded on for many months of silence
a chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage door had set loose a train of horrible thoughts
children begin by loving their parents as they grow older they judge them sometimes they forgive them his mother he remembered it as if it had been the lash of a hunting crop across his face
you are not listening to a word i am saying jim cried sibyl_vane and i am making the most delightful plans for your future
his brows knit together into a wedge like furrow and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip do say something
what do you want me to say oh that you will be a good boy and not forget us she answered smiling at him
he shrugged his shoulders you are more likely to forget me than i am to forget you sibyl_vane she flushed
what do you mean jim she asked you have a new friend i hear who is he why have you not told me about him
he means you no good stop jim she exclaimed you must not say anything against him i love him
why you dont even know his name answered the lad who is he i have a right to know
he is called prince_charming dont you like the name oh you silly boy you should never forget it if you only saw him you would think him the most wonderful person in the world
some day you will meet him when you come back from australia you will like him so much everybody likes him and i love him
i wish you could come to the theatre to night he is going to be there and i am to play juliet
oh how i shall play it fancy jim to be in love and play juliet to have him sitting there to play for his delight
i am afraid i may frighten the company frighten or enthrall them to be in love is to surpass one self
poor dreadful mr isaacs will be shouting genius to his loafers at the bar he has preached me as a dogma to night he will announce me as a revelation
i feel it and it is all his his only prince_charming my wonderful lover my god of graces but i am poor beside him
poor what does that matter when poverty creeps in at the door love flies in through the window our proverbs want rewriting
they were made in winter and it is summer now spring time for me i think a very dance of blossoms in blue skies
he is a gentleman said the lad sullenly a prince she cried musically what more do you want
he wants to enslave you i shudder at the thought of being free i want you to beware of him
to see him is to worship him to know him is to trust him sibyl_vane you are mad about him
she laughed and took his arm you dear old jim you talk as if you were a hundred some day you will be in love yourself
surely you should be glad to think that though you are going away you leave me happier than i have ever been before
then you will know what it is dont look so sulky life has been hard for us both terribly hard and difficult
but it will be different now you are going to a new world and i have found one here are two chair let us sit down and see the smart people go by
they took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers the tulip beds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire
a white dust tremulous cloud of orris root it seemed hung in the panting air the brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies
she made her brother talk of himself his hopes his prospects he spoke slowly and with effort they passed word to each other as players at a game pass counters
sibyl_vane felt oppressed she could not communicate her joy a faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win
suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lip and in an open carriage with two ladies mr_dorian_gray drove past
after some time she became silent she started to her foot there he is she cried who said jim vane
prince_charming she answered looking after the victoria he jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm show him to me
he exclaimed but at that moment the duke of berwick four in hand came between and when it had left the space clear the carriage had swept out of the park
which is he point him out i must see him he is gone murmured sibyl_vane sadly i wish you had seen him
i wish i had for as sure as there is a god in heaven if he ever does you any wrong i shall kill him
she looked at him in horror he repeated his word they cut the air like a dagger the people round began to gape
a lady standing close to her tittered come away jim come away she whispered he followed her doggedly as she passed through the crowd
he felt glad at what he had said when they reached the achilles statue she turned round there was pity in her eye that became laughter on her lip
she shook her head at him you are foolish jim utterly foolish a bad tempered boy that is all how can you say such horrible thing
you dont know what you are talking about you are simply jealous and unkind ah i wish you would fall in love
love makes people good and what you said was wicked i am sixteen he answered and i know what i am about
mother is no help to you she doesnt understand how to look after you i wish now that i was not going to australia at all
i have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up i would if my articles hadnt been signed oh dont be so serious jim
you are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas mother used to be so fond of acting in i am not going to quarrel with you
i have seen him and oh to see him is perfect happiness we wont quarrel i know you would never harm any one i love would you
not as long as you love him i suppose was the sullen answer i shall love him for ever she cried
and he for ever too he had better she shrank from him then she laughed and put her hand on his arm
he was merely a boy at the marble arch they hailed an omnibus which left them close to their shabby home in the euston road
it was after five clock and sibyl_vane had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting jim insisted that she should do so
he said that he would sooner part with her when their mother was not present she would be sure to make a scene and he detested scenes of every kind
there was jealousy in the lad heart and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who as it seemed to him had come between them
yet when her arm were flung round his neck and her fingers strayed through his hair he softened and kissed her with real affection
in sybil own room they parted there were tears in his eye as he went downstairs his mother was waiting for him below
she grumbled at his unpunctuality as he entered he made no answer but sat down to his meagre meal the flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth
through the rumble of omnibuses and the clatter of street cabs he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him
after some time he thrust away his plate and put his head in his hand he felt that he had a right to know
it should have been told to him before if it was as he suspected leaden with fear his mother watched him
word dropped mechanically from her lip a tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers when the clock struck six he got up and went to the door
then he turned back and looked at her their eye met in hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy it enraged him
mother i have something to ask you he said her eye wandered vaguely about the room she made no answer
tell me the truth i have a right to know were you married to my father she heaved a deep sigh
the terrible moment the moment that night and day for weeks and months she had dreaded had come at last and yet she felt no terror
it was a sigh of relief indeed in some measure it was a disappointment to her the vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer
the situation had not been gradually led up to it was crude it reminded her of a bad rehearsal no she answered wondering at the harsh simplicity of life
my father was a scoundrel then cried the lad clenching his fists she shook her head i knew he was not free
we loved each other very much if he had lived he would have made provision for us dont speak against him my son
he was your father and a gentleman indeed he was highly connected an oath broke from his lip i dont care for myself he exclaimed but dont let sibyl_vane
it is a gentleman isnt it who is in love with her or says he is highly connected too i suppose
for a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman her head drooped she wiped her eye with shaking hand
sibyl_vane has a mother she murmured i had none the lad was touched he went towards her and stooping down he kissed her
i am sorry if i have pained you by asking about my father he said but i could not help it
dont forget that you will have only one child now to look after and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister i will find out who he is track him down and kill him like a dog
the exaggerated folly of the threat the passionate gesture that accompanied it the mad melodramatic word made life seem more vivid to her
i must go now good bye i swear it she was familiar with the atmosphere she breathed more freely and for the first time for many months she really admired her son
she would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale but he cut her short trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for
the lodging house drudge bustled in and out there was the bargaining with the cabman the moment was lost in vulgar details
it was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window as her son drove away
she consoled herself by telling sibyl_vane how desolate she felt her life would be now that she had only one child to look after
she was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted she remembered the phrase it had pleased her of the threat she said nothing
i suppose you have heard the news basil_hallward said lord_henry_wotton that evening as basil_hallward was shown into a little private room at the bristol where dinner had been laid for three
it was vividly and dramatically expressed she felt that they would all laugh at it some day chapter no harry answered the artist giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter
there is hardly a single person in the house of commons worth painting though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing
what is it nothing about politics i hope they dont interest me mr_dorian_gray is engaged to be married said lord_henry_wotton watching him as he spoke
basil_hallward started and then frowned mr_dorian_gray engaged to be married he cried impossible it is perfectly true to whom
to some little actress or other i cant believe it mr_dorian_gray is far too sensible mr_dorian_gray is far too wise not to do foolish thing now and
then my dear basil_hallward marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then harry except in america rejoined lord_henry_wotton languidly
but i didnt say he was married i said he was engaged to be married there is a great difference
i have a distinct remembrance of being married but i have no recollection at all of being engaged i am inclined to think that i never was engaged
but think of mr_dorian_gray birth and position and wealth it would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him
if you want to make him marry this girl tell him that basil_hallward he is sure to do it then
whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing it is always from the noblest motives i hope the girl is good harry
i dont want to see mr_dorian_gray tied to some vile creature who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect
oh she is better than good she is beautiful murmured lord_henry_wotton sipping a glass of vermouth and orange bitters mr_dorian_gray says she is beautiful and he is not often wrong about thing of that kind
your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people it has had that excellent effect amongst others
we are to see her to night if that boy doesnt forget his appointment are you serious quite serious basil_hallward i should be miserable if i thought i should ever be more serious than i am at the present moment
but do you approve of it harry asked the painter walking up and down the room and biting his lip
you cant approve of it possibly it is some silly infatuation i never approve or disapprove of anything now it is an absurd attitude to take towards life
we are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices i never take any notice of what common people say and i never interfere with what charming people do
if a personality fascinates me whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me mr_dorian_gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts juliet and proposes to marry her
why not if he wedded messalina he would be none the less interesting you know i am not a champion of marriage
the real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish and unselfish people are colourless they lack individuality still there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex
they retain their egotism and add to it many other egos they are forced to have more than one life they become more highly organized and to be highly organized is i should fancy the object of man existence
i hope that mr_dorian_gray will make this girl his wife passionately adore her for six months and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else
besides every experience is of value and whatever one may say against marriage it is certainly an experience he would be a wonderful study
you dont mean a single word of all that harry you know you dont if mr_dorian_gray life were spoiled no one would be sorrier than yourself
you are much better than you pretend to be lord_henry_wotton laughed the reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves
we think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us
we praise the banker that we may overdraw our account and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets
the basis of optimism is sheer terror i mean everything that i have said i have the greatest contempt for optimism
as for a spoiled life no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested if you want to mar a nature you have merely to reform it
as for marriage of course that would be silly but there are other and more interesting bonds between man and woman
i will certainly encourage them they have the charm of being fashionable but here is mr_dorian_gray himself he will tell you more than i can
my dear harry my dear basil_hallward you must both congratulate me said the lad throwing off his evening cape with its satin lined wings and shaking each of his friend by the hand in turn
i have never been so happy of course it is sudden all really delightful thing are and yet it seems to me to be the one thing i have been looking for all my life
i hope you will always be very happy mr_dorian_gray said basil_hallward but i dont quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement
and i dont forgive you for being late for dinner broke in lord_henry_wotton putting his hand on the lad shoulder and smiling as he spoke
come let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like and then you will tell us how it all came about
he was flushed with excitement and pleasure and looked extraordinarily handsome you let harry know there is really not much to tell cried mr_dorian_gray as they took their seats at the small round table
after i left you yesterday evening harry i dressed had some dinner at that little italian restaurant in rupert street you introduced me to and went down at eight clock to the theatre
what happened was simply this sibyl_vane was playing rosalind of course the scenery was dreadful and the orlando absurd but sibyl_vane
she wore a moss coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves slim brown cross gartered hose a dainty little green cap with a hawk feather caught in a jewel and a hooded cloak lined with dull red
you should have seen her when she came on in her boy clothes she was perfectly wonderful she had never seemed to me more exquisite
she had all the delicate grace of that tanagra figurine that you have in your studio basil_hallward her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose
as for her acting well you shall see her to night she is simply a born artist i sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled
i forgot that i was in london and in the nineteenth century i was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen
after the performance was over i went behind and spoke to her as we were sitting together suddenly there came into her eye
a look that i had never seen there before my lip moved towards hers we kissed each other i cant describe to you what i felt at that moment
it seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose coloured joy she trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus
then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hand i feel that i should not tell you all this but i cant help it
of course our engagement is a dead secret she has not even told her own mother i dont know what my guardians will say
lord radley is sure to be furious i dont care i shall be of age in less than a year and then i can do what i like
i have been right basil_hallward havent i to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in shakespeare plays
lip that shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear i have had the arm of rosalind around me and kissed juliet on the mouth
yes mr_dorian_gray i suppose you were right said basil_hallward slowly have you seen her to day asked lord_henry_wotton mr_dorian_gray shook his head
i left her in the forest of arden i shall find her in an orchard in verona lord_henry_wotton sipped his champagne in a meditative manner
at what particular point did you mention the word marriage mr_dorian_gray and what did she say in answer perhaps you forgot all about it
my dear harry i did not treat it as a business transaction and i did not make any formal proposal
i told her that i loved her and she said she was not worthy to be my wife not worthy why the whole world is nothing to me compared with her
woman are wonderfully practical murmured lord_henry_wotton much more practical than we are in situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage and they always remind us
basil_hallward laid his hand upon his arm dont harry you have annoyed mr_dorian_gray he is not like other man he would never bring misery upon any one
his nature is too fine for that lord_henry_wotton looked across the table mr_dorian_gray is never annoyed with me he answered
i asked the question for the best reason possible for the only reason indeed that excuses one for asking any question simple curiosity
i have a theory that it is always the woman who propose to us and not we who propose to the woman
except of course in middle class life but then the middle classes are not modern mr_dorian_gray laughed and tossed his head
when you see sibyl_vane you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast a beast without a heart
you are quite incorrigible harry but i dont mind it is impossible to be angry with you i cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he love
i want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine
i love sibyl_vane what is marriage an irrevocable vow you mock at it for that ah dont mock it is an irrevocable vow that i want to take
her trust makes me faithful her belief makes me good when i am with her i regret all that you have taught me
i am changed and the mere touch of sibyl_vane hand makes me forget you and all your wrong fascinating poisonous delightful theories
i become different from what you have known me to be and those are asked lord_henry_wotton helping himself to some salad
oh your theories about life your theories about love your theories about pleasure all your theories in fact harry pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about he answered in his slow melodious voice
but i am afraid i cannot claim my theory as my own it belongs to nature not to me pleasure is nature test her sign of approval
when we are happy we are always good but when we are good we are not always happy ah but what do you mean by good
yes echoed mr_dorian_gray leaning back in his chair and looking at lord_henry_wotton over the heavy clusters of purple lipped irises that stood in the centre of the table what do you mean by good harry
to be good is to be in harmony with one self he replied touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale fine pointed fingers
cried basil_hallward discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others one own life that is the important thing
as for the life of one neighbours if one wishes to be a prig or a puritan one can flaunt one moral views about them but they are not one concern
i consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality
but surely if one life merely for one self harry one pays a terrible price for doing so suggested the painter
besides individualism has really the higher aim modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one age yes we are overcharged for everything nowadays
i should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self denial beautiful sin like beautiful thing are the privilege of the rich
one has to pay in other way but money what sort of way basil_hallward oh i should fancy in remorse in suffering in
well in the consciousness of degradation lord_henry_wotton shrugged his shoulders my dear fellow mediaeval art is charming but mediaeval emotions are out of date
but then the only thing that one can use in fiction are the thing that one has ceased to use in fact
one can use them in fiction of course believe me no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is
i know what pleasure is cried mr_dorian_gray it is to adore some one that is certainly better than being adored he answered toying with some fruits
being adored is a nuisance woman treat us just as humanity treats its gods they worship us and are always bothering us to do something for them
i should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us murmured the lad gravely they create love in our natures
they have a right to demand it back that is quite true mr_dorian_gray cried basil_hallward nothing is ever quite true said lord_henry_wotton
this is interrupted mr_dorian_gray you must admit harry that woman give to man the very gold of their life
woman as some witty frenchman once put it inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out
possibly he sighed but they invariably want it back in such very small change that is the worry harry you are dreadful
i dont know why i like you so much you will always like me mr_dorian_gray he replied will you have some coffee you fellows
waiter bring coffee and fine champagne and some cigarettes no dont mind the cigarettes i have some basil_hallward i cant allow you to smoke cigars
you must have a cigarette a cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure it is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied
what more can one want yes mr_dorian_gray you will always be fond of me i represent to you all the sin you have never had the courage to commit
what nonsense you talk harry cried the lad taking a light from a fire breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table
let us go down to the theatre when sibyl_vane comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life
i have known everything said lord_henry_wotton with a tired look in his eye but i am always ready for a new emotion
she will represent something to you that you have never known i am afraid however that for me at any rate there is no such thing
still your wonderful girl may thrill me i love acting it is so much more real than life let us go
mr_dorian_gray you will come with me i am so sorry basil_hallward but there is only room for two in the brougham
you must follow us in a hansom they got up and put on their coats sipping their coffee standing the painter was silent and preoccupied
he could not bear this marriage and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other thing that might have happened
he drove off by himself as had been arranged and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him
there was a gloom over him after a few minutes they all passed downstairs a strange sense of loss came over him
he felt that mr_dorian_gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past life had come between them
his eye darkened and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eye when the cab drew up at the theatre it seemed to him that he had grown year older
for some reason or other the house was crowded that night and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile
he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility waving his fat jewelled hand and talking at the top of his voice
chapter mr_dorian_gray loathed him more than ever he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban
at least he declared he did and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet
lord_henry_wotton upon the other hand rather liked him basil_hallward amused himself with watching the face in the pit the heat was terribly oppressive and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire
the youth in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side they talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girl who sat beside them
some woman were laughing in the pit their voice were horribly shrill and discordant the sound of the popping of corks came from the bar
what a place to find one divinity in said lord_henry_wotton yes answered mr_dorian_gray it was here
i found her and she is divine beyond all living thing when she acts you will forget everything these common rough people with their coarse face and brutal gestures become quite different when she is on the stage
they sit silently and watch her they weep and laugh as she wills them to do she makes them as responsive as a violin
she spiritualizes them and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one self the same flesh and blood as one self
oh i hope not exclaimed lord_henry_wotton who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera glass dont pay any attention to him mr_dorian_gray said the painter
any one you love must be marvellous and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble
if this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose life have been sordid and ugly if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own she is worthy of all your adoration worthy of the adoration of the world
i understand what you mean and i believe in this girl to spiritualize one age that is something worth doing this marriage is quite right
i did not think so at first but i admit it now the gods made sibyl_vane for you without her you would have been incomplete
thanks basil_hallward answered mr_dorian_gray pressing his hand i knew that you would understand me harry is so cynical he terrifies me
then the curtain rises and you will see the girl to whom i am going to give all my life to whom i have given everything that is good in me
but here is the orchestra it is quite dreadful but it only lasts for about five minutes a quarter of an hour afterwards amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause sibyl_vane stepped on to the stage
yes she was certainly lovely to look at one of the loveliest creatures lord_henry_wotton thought that he had ever seen
a faint blush like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house
there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eye she stepped back a few paces and her lip seemed to tremble
basil_hallward leaped to his foot and began to applaud motionless and as one in a dream sat mr_dorian_gray gazing at her
the scene was the hall of capulet house and romeo in his pilgrim dress had entered with mercutio and his other friend
lord_henry_wotton peered through his glasses murmuring charming charming the band such as it was struck up a few bars of music and the dance began
through the crowd of ungainly shabbily dressed actors sibyl_vane moved like a creature from a finer world her body swayed while she danced as a plant sways in the water
the curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily her hand seemed to be made of cool ivory
yet she was curiously listless she showed no sign of joy when her eye rested on romeo the few word she had to speak good pilgrim
which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hand that pilgrims hand do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss with the brief dialogue that follows were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner
you do wrong your hand too much the voice was exquisite but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false
it was wrong in colour it took away all the life from the verse it made the passion unreal mr_dorian_gray grew pale as he watched her
he was puzzled and anxious neither of his friend dared to say anything to him she seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent
they were horribly disappointed yet they felt that the true test of any juliet is the balcony scene of the second act
they waited for that if she failed there there was nothing in her she looked charming as she came out in the moonlight
that could not be denied but the staginess of her acting was unbearable and grew worse as she went on her gestures became absurdly artificial
she overemphasized everything that she had to say the beautiful passage thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
for that which thou hast heard me speak to night was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to recite by some second rate professor of elocution
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek when she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines
it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens
this bud of love by summer ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet she spoke the word as though they conveyed no meaning to her
although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract to night sweet good night it was not nervousness indeed so far from being nervous she was absolutely self contained
it was simply bad art she was a complete failure even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play
they got restless and began to talk loudly and to whistle the jew manager who was standing at the back of the dress circle stamped and swore with rage
when the second act was over there came a storm of hisses and lord_henry_wotton got up from his chair and put on his coat
the only person unmoved was the girl herself she is quite beautiful mr_dorian_gray he said but she cant act let us go
i am going to see the play through answered the lad in a hard bitter voice i am awfully sorry that i have made you waste an evening harry
i apologize to you both my dear mr_dorian_gray i should think miss vane was ill interrupted basil_hallward we will come some other night
i wish she were ill he rejoined but she seems to me to be simply callous and cold she has entirely altered
last night she was a great artist this evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress dont talk like that about any one you love mr_dorian_gray
love is a more wonderful thing than art they are both simply forms of imitation remarked lord_henry_wotton
but do let us go mr_dorian_gray you must not stay here any longer it is not good for one morals to see bad acting
besides i dont suppose you will want your wife to act so what does it matter if she plays juliet like a wooden doll
she is very lovely and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting she will be a delightful experience
there are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating people who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing
good heavens my dear boy dont look so tragic the secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming
come to the club with basil_hallward and myself we will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of sibyl_vane she is beautiful
what more can you want go away harry cried the lad i want to be alone basil_hallward you must go
his lip trembled and rushing to the back of the box he leaned up against the wall hiding his face in his hand
let us go basil_hallward said lord_henry_wotton with a strange tenderness in his voice and the two young man passed out together
ah cant you see that my heart is breaking the hot tears came to his eye a few moment afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the third act
mr_dorian_gray went back to his seat he looked pale and proud and indifferent the play dragged on and seemed interminable
half of the audience went out tramping in heavy boots and laughing the whole thing was a fiasco the last act was played to almost empty benches
the curtain went down on a titter and some groans as soon as it was over mr_dorian_gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom
the girl was standing there alone with a look of triumph on her face her eye were lit with an exquisite fire
there was a radiance about her her parted lip were smiling over some secret of their own when he entered she looked at him and an expression of infinite joy came over her
how badly i acted to night mr_dorian_gray she cried horribly he answered gazing at her in amazement horribly it was dreadful
are you ill you have no idea what it was you have no idea what i suffered the girl smiled
mr_dorian_gray she answered lingering over his name with long drawn music in her voice as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth
mr_dorian_gray you should have understood but you understand now dont you understand what he asked angrily why i was so bad to night
why i shall always be bad why i shall never act well again he shrugged his shoulders you are ill i suppose
when you are ill you shouldnt act you make yourself ridiculous my friend were bored i was bored she seemed not to listen to him
she was transfigured with joy an ecstasy of happiness dominated her mr_dorian_gray dorian she cried before i knew you acting was the one reality of my life
it was only in the theatre that i lived i thought that it was all true i was rosalind one night and portia the other
the joy of beatrice was my joy and the sorrows of cordelia were mine also i believed in everything the common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike
the painted scenes were my world i knew nothing but shadows and i thought them real you came oh my beautiful love and you freed my soul from prison
to night for the first time in my life i saw through the hollowness the sham the silliness of the empty pageant in which i had always played
to night for the first time i became conscious that the romeo was hideous and old and painted that the moonlight in the orchard was false that the scenery was vulgar and that the word i had to speak were unreal were not my word were not what i wanted to say
you taught me what reality really is you had brought me something higher something of which all art is but a reflection
you had made me understand what love really is my love my love prince_charming prince of life i have grown sick of shadows
you are more to me than all art can ever be what have i to do with the puppets of a play
when i came on to night i could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me i thought that i was going to be wonderful
i found that i could do nothing suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant the knowledge was exquisite to me
i heard them hissing and i smiled what could they know of love such as ours take me away mr_dorian_gray take me away with you where we can be quite alone
i hate the stage i might mimic a passion that i do not feel but i cannot mimic one that burns me like fire
oh mr_dorian_gray dorian you understand now what it signifies even if i could do it it would be profanation for me to play at being in love
you have made me see that he flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face you have killed my love he muttered
she looked at him in wonder and laughed he made no answer she came across to him and with her little fingers stroked his hair
she knelt down and pressed his hand to her lip he drew them away and a shudder ran through him then he leaped up and went to the door
yes he cried you have killed my love you used to stir my imagination now you dont even stir my curiosity
i loved you because you were marvellous because you had genius and intellect because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art
you simply produce no effect you have thrown it all away you are shallow and stupid my god how mad i was to love you
what a fool i have been you are nothing to me now i will never see you again i will never think of you
i will never mention your name you dont know what you were to me once why once oh i cant bear to think of it
i wish i had never laid eye upon you you have spoiled the romance of my life how little you can know of love if you say it mars your art
without your art you are nothing i would have made you famous splendid magnificent the world would have worshipped you and you would have borne my name
what are you now a third rate actress with a pretty face the girl grew white and trembled she clenched her hand together and her voice seemed to catch in her throat
you are not serious mr_dorian_gray she murmured you are acting acting i leave that to you you do it so well he answered bitterly
she rose from her knees and with a piteous expression of pain in her face came across the room to him
she put her hand upon his arm and looked into his eye he thrust her back dont touch me he cried
a low moan broke from her and she flung herself at his foot and lay there like a trampled flower
mr_dorian_gray dorian dont leave me she whispered i am so sorry i didnt act well i was thinking of you all the time
but i will try indeed i will try it came so suddenly across me my love for you i think i should never have known it if you had not kissed me if we had not kissed each other
kiss me again my love dont go away from me i couldnt bear it oh dont go away from me my brother
no never mind he didnt mean it he was in jest but you oh cant you forgive me for to night i will work so hard and try to improve
dont be cruel to me because i love you better than anything in the world after all it is only once that i have not pleased you
but you are quite right mr_dorian_gray i should have shown myself more of an artist it was foolish of me and yet i couldnt help it
she crouched on the floor like a wounded thing and mr_dorian_gray with his beautiful eye looked down at her and his chiselled lip curled in exquisite disdain
oh dont leave me dont leave me a fit of passionate sobbing choked her there is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love
sibyl_vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic her tears and sobs annoyed him i am going he said at last in his calm clear voice
i dont wish to be unkind but i cant see you again you have disappointed me she wept silently and made no answer but crept nearer
her little hand stretched blindly out and appeared to be seeking for him he turned on his heel and left the room
in a few moment he was out of the theatre where he went to he hardly knew he remembered wandering through dimly lit streets past gaunt black shadowed archways and evil looking house
woman with hoarse voice and harsh laughter had called after him drunkards had reeled by cursing and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes
he had seen grotesque children huddled upon door steps and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts as the dawn was just breaking he found himself close to covent garden
the darkness lifted and flushed with faint fires the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street
the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain
he followed into the market and watched the man unloading their waggons a white smocked carter offered him some cherries he thanked him wondered why he refused to accept any money for them and began to eat them listlessly
a long line of boy carrying crates of striped tulips and of yellow and red roses defiled in front of him threading their way through the huge jade green piles of vegetables
under the portico with its grey sun bleached pillars loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girl waiting for the auction to be over
they had been plucked at midnight and the coldness of the moon had entered into them others crowded round the swinging door of the coffee house in the piazza
the heavy cart horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones shaking their bells and trappings some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks
iris necked and pink footed the pigeons ran about picking up seeds after a little while he hailed a hansom and drove home
for a few moment he loitered upon the doorstep looking round at the silent square with its blank close shuttered window and its staring blinds
the sky was pure opal now and the roofs of the house glistened like silver against it from some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising
in the huge gilt venetian lantern spoil of some doge barge that hung from the ceiling of the great oak panelled hall of entrance lights were still burning from three flickering jets thin blue petals of flame they seemed rimmed with white fire
he turned them out and having thrown his hat and cape on the table passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that in his new born feeling for luxury he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at selby royal
as he was turning the handle of the door his eye fell upon the portrait basil_hallward had painted of him
it curled a violet riband through the nacre coloured air he started back as if in surprise then he went on into his own room looking somewhat puzzled
after he had taken the button hole out of his coat he seemed to hesitate finally he came back went over to the picture and examined it
in the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream coloured silk blinds the face appeared to him to be a little changed
the expression looked different one would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth it was certainly strange
he turned round and walking to the window drew up the blind the bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners where they lay shuddering
but the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there to be more intensified even
the quivering ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing
he winced and taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory cupids one of lord_henry_wotton many presents to him glanced hurriedly into its polished depths
no line like that warped his red lip what did it mean he rubbed his eye and came close to the picture and examined it again
there were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered
it was not a mere fancy of his own the thing was horribly apparent he threw himself into a chair and began to think
suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in basil_hallward studio the day the picture had been finished
he had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young and the portrait grow old that his own beauty might be untarnished and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passion and his sin that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood
yes he remembered it perfectly surely his wish had not been fulfilled such thing were impossible it seemed monstrous even to think of them
and yet there was the picture before him with the touch of cruelty in the mouth cruelty had he been cruel
he had dreamed of her as a great artist had given his love to her because he had thought her great
and yet a feeling of infinite regret came over him as he thought of her lying at his foot sobbing like a little child
it was the girl fault not his then she had disappointed him she had been shallow and unworthy he remembered with what callousness he had watched her
why had he been made like that why had such a soul been given to him but he had suffered also
during the three terrible hours that the play had lasted he had lived centuries of pain aeon upon aeon of torture
his life was well worth hers she had marred him for a moment if he had wounded her for an age
besides woman were better suited to bear sorrow than man they lived on their emotions they only thought of their emotions
when they took lovers it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes lord_henry_wotton had told him that and lord_henry_wotton knew what woman were
why should he trouble about sibyl_vane she was nothing to him now but the picture what was he to say of that
it held the secret of his life and told his story it had taught him to love his own beauty would it teach him to loathe his own soul
would he ever look at it again no it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled sense the horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it
suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes man mad the picture had not changed it was folly to think so
yet it was watching him with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight
its blue eye met his own a sense of infinite pity not for himself but for the painted image of himself came over him
it had altered already and would alter more its gold would wither into grey its red and white roses would die
for every sin that he committed a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness but he would not sin the picture changed or unchanged would be to him the visible emblem of conscience
he would not see lord_henry_wotton any more would not at any rate listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil_hallward garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible thing
he would resist temptation he would go back to sibyl_vane make her amends marry her try to love her again
yes it was his duty to do so she must have suffered more than he had poor child he had been selfish and cruel to her
the fascination that she had exercised over him would return they would be happy together his life with her would be beautiful and pure
he got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait shuddering as he glanced at it
how horrible he murmured to himself and he walked across to the window and opened it when he stepped out on to the grass he drew a deep breath
the fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passion he thought only of sibyl_vane a faint echo of his love came back to him
he repeated her name over and over again the birds that were singing in the dew drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her
his valet had crept several time on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late
finally his bell sounded and victor came in softly with a cup of tea and a pile of letters on a small tray of old sevres china and drew back the olive satin curtains with their shimmering blue lining that hung in front of the three tall window
chapter it was long past noon when he awoke monsieur has well slept this morning he said smiling
what clock is it victor asked mr_dorian_gray drowsily one hour and a quarter monsieur how late it was
he sat up and having sipped some tea turned over his letters one of them was from lord_henry_wotton and had been brought by hand that morning
they contained the usual collection of cards invitations to dinner tickets for private views programmes of charity concerts and the like that are showered on fashionable young man every morning during the season
there was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver louis quinze toilet set that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians who were extremely old fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary thing are our only necessities and there were several very courteously worded communications from jermyn street money lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moment notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest
after about ten minutes he got up and throwing on an elaborate dressing gown of silk embroidered cashmere wool passed into the onyx paved bathroom
he hesitated for a moment and then put it aside the others he opened listlessly the cool water refreshed him after his long sleep
a dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice but there was the unreality of a dream about it
as soon as he was dressed he went into the library and sat down to a light french breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to the open window
he seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through it was an exquisite day the warm air seemed laden with spices
a bee flew in and buzzed round the blue dragon bowl that filled with sulphur yellow roses stood before him he felt perfectly happy
suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait and he started too cold for monsieur asked his valet putting an omelette on the table
i shut the window mr_dorian_gray shook his head i am not cold he murmured was it all true
or had it been simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy
had the portrait really changed surely a painted canvas could not alter the thing was absurd it would serve as a tale to tell basil_hallward some day
first in the dim twilight and then in the bright dawn he had seen the touch of cruelty round the warped lip
it would make him smile and yet how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing he almost dreaded his valet leaving the room
when the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go he felt a wild desire to tell him to remain
he knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait he was afraid of certainty as the door was closing behind him he called him back
the man stood waiting for his orders mr_dorian_gray looked at him for a moment i am not at home to any one victor he said with a sigh
then he rose from the table lit a cigarette and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen
the man bowed and retired the screen was an old one of gilt spanish leather stamped and wrought with a rather florid louis quatorze pattern
he scanned it curiously wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man life should he move it aside after all
why not let it stay there what was the use of knowing if the thing was true it was terrible if it was not true why trouble about it
but what if by some fate or deadlier chance eye other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change what should he do if basil_hallward came and asked to look at his own picture
basil_hallward would be sure to do that no the thing had to be examined and at once anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt
he got up and locked both door at least he would be alone when he looked upon the mask of his shame
as he often remembered afterwards and always with no small wonder he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest
then he drew the screen aside and saw himself face to face it was perfectly true the portrait had altered that such a change should have taken place was incredible to him
was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him
and yet it was a fact could it be that what that soul thought they realized that what it dreamed they made true
or was there some other more terrible reason he shuddered and felt afraid and going back to the couch lay there gazing at the picture in sickened horror
one thing however he felt that it had done for him it had made him conscious how unjust how cruel he had been to sibyl_vane
his unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence would be transformed into some nobler passion and the portrait that basil_hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life would be to him what holiness is to some and conscience to others and the fear of god to us all
it was not too late to make reparation for that she could still be his wife there were opiates for remorse drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep
but here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin here was an ever present sign of the ruin man brought upon their soul
he was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering
three clock struck and four and the half hour rang its double chime but mr_dorian_gray did not stir he did not know what to do or what to think
finally he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness
he covered page after page with wild word of sorrow and wilder word of pain there is a luxury in self reproach
when we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us it is the confession not the priest that gives us absolution
when mr_dorian_gray had finished the letter he felt that he had been forgiven suddenly there came a knock to the door and he heard lord_henry_wotton voice outside
my dear boy i must see you let me in at once i cant bear your shutting yourself up like this
yes it was better to let lord_henry_wotton in and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel to part if parting was inevitable
he made no answer at first but remained quite still the knocking still continued and grew louder he jumped up drew the screen hastily across the picture and unlocked the door
i am so sorry for it all mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton as he entered but you must not think too much about it
do you mean about sibyl_vane asked the lad yes of course answered lord_henry_wotton sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves
it is dreadful from one point of view but it was not your fault tell me did you go behind and see her after the play was over
yes i felt sure you had did you make a scene with her i was brutal harry perfectly brutal but it is all right now
i am not sorry for anything that has happened it has taught me to know myself better ah mr_dorian_gray i am so glad you take it in that way
i was afraid i would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours i have got through all that said mr_dorian_gray shaking his head and smiling
i am perfectly happy now i know what conscience is to begin with it is not what you told me it was
it is the divinest thing in us dont sneer at it harry any more at least not before me i want to be good
i cant bear the idea of my soul being hideous a very charming artistic basis for ethics mr_dorian_gray i congratulate you on it
but how are you going to begin by marrying sibyl_vane marrying sibyl_vane cried lord_henry_wotton standing up and looking at him in perplexed amazement
but my dear mr_dorian_gray yes harry i know what you are going to say something dreadful about marriage dont say it
dont ever say thing of that kind to me again two day ago i asked sibyl_vane to marry me i am not going to break my word to her
she is to be my wife your wife mr_dorian_gray didnt you get my letter i wrote to you this morning and sent the note down by my own man
your letter oh yes i remember i have not read it yet harry i was afraid there might be something in it that i wouldnt like
lord_henry_wotton walked across the room and sitting down by mr_dorian_gray took both his hand in his own and held them tightly
you cut life to pieces with your epigrams you know nothing then what do you mean mr_dorian_gray he said my letter dont be frightened was to tell you that sibyl_vane is dead
a cry of pain broke from the lad lip and he leaped to his foot tearing his hand away from lord_henry_wotton grasp
dead sibyl_vane dead it is not true it is a horrible lie how dare you say it it is quite true mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton gravely
it is in all the morning papers i wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till i came
there will have to be an inquest of course and you must not be mixed up in it thing like that make a man fashionable in paris
but in london people are so prejudiced here one should never make one debut with a scandal one should reserve that to give an interest to one old age
i suppose they dont know your name at the theatre if they dont it is all right did any one see you going round to her room
that is an important point mr_dorian_gray did not answer for a few moment he was dazed with horror finally he stammered in a stifled voice harry did you say an inquest
what did you mean by that did sibyl_vane oh harry i cant bear it but be quick tell me everything at once
i have no doubt it was not an accident mr_dorian_gray though it must be put in that way to the public
it seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother about half past twelve or so she said she had forgotten something upstairs
they waited some time for her but she did not come down again they ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing room
she had swallowed something by mistake some dreadful thing they use at theatres i dont know what it was but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it
i should fancy it was prussic acid as she seems to have died instantaneously harry harry it is terrible cried the lad
yes it is very tragic of course but you must not get yourself mixed up in it i see by the standard that she was seventeen
i should have thought she was almost younger than that she looked such a child and seemed to know so little about acting
mr_dorian_gray you mustnt let this thing get on your nerves you must come and dine with me and afterwards we will look in at the opera
it is a patti night and everybody will be there you can come to my sister box she has got some smart woman with her
so i have murdered sibyl_vane said mr_dorian_gray half to himself murdered her as surely as if i had cut her little throat with a knife
and to night i am to dine with you and then go on to the opera and sup somewhere i suppose afterwards
yet the roses are not less lovely for all that the birds sing just as happily in my garden how extraordinarily dramatic life is
if i had read all this in a book harry i think i would have wept over it somehow now that it has happened actually and to me it seems far too wonderful for tears
here is the first passionate love letter i have ever written in my life strange that my first passionate love letter should have been addressed to a dead girl
can they feel i wonder those white silent people we call the dead sibyl_vane can she feel or know or listen
oh harry how i loved her once it seems year ago to me now she was everything to me then came that dreadful night was it really only last night when
she played so badly and my heart almost broke she explained it all to me it was terribly pathetic but i was not moved a bit
i thought her shallow suddenly something happened that made me afraid i cant tell you what it was but it was terrible
i said i would go back to her i felt i had done wrong and now she is dead my god
my god harry what shall i do you dont know the danger i am in and there is nothing to keep me straight
my dear mr_dorian_gray answered lord_henry_wotton taking a cigarette from his case and producing a gold latten matchbox the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life
she would have done that for me she had no right to kill herself it was selfish of her if you had married this girl you would have been wretched
of course you would have treated her kindly one can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing but she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her
and when a woman finds that out about her husband she either becomes dreadfully dowdy or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman husband has to pay for
i say nothing about the social mistake which would have been abject which of course i would not have allowed but i assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure
i suppose it would muttered the lad walking up and down the room and looking horribly pale but i thought it was my duty
it is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right i remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions that they are always made too late
mine certainly were good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws their origin is pure vanity their result is absolutely nil
they give us now and then some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak that is all that can be said for them
harry cried mr_dorian_gray coming over and sitting down beside him why is it that i cannot feel this tragedy as much as i want to
they are simply cheques that man draw on a bank where they have no account i dont think i am heartless
you have done too many foolish thing during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name mr_dorian_gray answered lord_henry_wotton with his sweet melancholy smile
do you the lad frowned i dont like that explanation harry he rejoined but i am glad you dont think i am heartless
i am nothing of the kind i know i am not and yet i must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should
it has all the terrible beauty of a greek tragedy a tragedy in which i took a great part but by which i have not been wounded
it is an interesting question said lord_henry_wotton who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad unconscious egotism an extremely interesting question
it seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play i fancy that the true explanation is this
it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence their absolute incoherence their absurd want of meaning their entire lack of style
they affect us just as vulgarity affects us they give us an impression of sheer brute force and we revolt against that
sometimes however a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our life if these elements of beauty are real the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect
suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors but the spectators of the play or rather we are both
we watch ourselves and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us in the present case what is it that has really happened
some one has killed herself for love of you i wish that i had ever had such an experience it would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life
the people who have adored me there have not been very many but there have been some have always insisted on living on long after i had ceased to care for them or they to care for me
they have become stout and tedious and when i meet them they go in at once for reminiscences that awful memory of woman
what a fearful thing it is and what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals one should absorb the colour of life but one should never remember its details
details are always vulgar i must sow poppies in my garden sighed mr_dorian_gray there is no necessity rejoined his companion
i once wore nothing but violets all through one season as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die
life has always poppies in her hand of course now and then thing linger ultimately however it did die i forget what killed it
i think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me that is always a dreadful moment it fills one with the terror of eternity
i found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question and she insisted on going over the whole thing again and digging up the past and raking up the future
well would you believe it a week ago at lady hampshire i had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel she dragged it out again and assured me that i had spoiled her life
i am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner so i did not feel any anxiety but what a lack of taste she showed
the one charm of the past is that it is the past but woman never know when the curtain has fallen
they always want a sixth act and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it
if they were allowed their own way every comedy would have a tragic ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce
i assure you mr_dorian_gray that not one of the woman i have known would have done for me what sibyl_vane did for you
they are charmingly artificial but they have no sense of art you are more fortunate than i am ordinary woman always console themselves
never trust a woman who wears mauve whatever her age may be or a woman over thirty five who is fond of pink ribbons
some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours it always means that they have a history others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands
they flaunt their conjugal felicity in one face as if it were the most fascinating of sin religion consoles some its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation a woman once told me and i can quite understand it
besides nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner conscience makes egotists of us all yes there is really no end to the consolations that woman find in modern life
indeed i have not mentioned the most important one what is that harry said the lad listlessly oh the obvious consolation
taking some one else admirer when one loses one own in good society that always whitewashes a woman but really mr_dorian_gray how different sibyl_vane must have been from all the woman one meets
there is something to me quite beautiful about her death i am glad i am living in a century when such wonders happen
they make one believe in the reality of the thing we all play with such as romance passion and love
i was terribly cruel to her you forget that i am afraid that woman appreciate cruelty downright cruelty more than anything else
they have wonderfully primitive instincts we have emancipated them but they remain slaves looking for their masters all the same they love being dominated
i am sure you were splendid i have never seen you really and absolutely angry but i can fancy how delightful you looked
and after all you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful but that i see now was absolutely true and it holds the key to everything
you said to me that sibyl_vane represented to you all the heroines of romance that she was desdemona one night and ophelia the other that if she died as juliet she came to life as imogen
what was that harry she will never come to life again now muttered the lad burying his face in his hand
but you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some jacobean tragedy as a wonderful scene from webster or ford or cyril tourneur
no she will never come to life she has played her last part the girl never really lived and so she has never really died
to you at least she was always a dream a phantom that flitted through shakespeare plays and left them lovelier for its presence a reed through which shakespeare music sounded richer and more full of joy
the moment she touched actual life she marred it and it marred her and so she passed away mourn for ophelia if you like
put ashes on your head because cordelia was strangled cry out against heaven because the daughter of brabantio died but dont waste your tears over sibyl_vane
she was less real than they are there was a silence the evening darkened in the room noiselessly and with silver foot the shadows crept in from the garden
the colours faded wearily out of thing after some time mr_dorian_gray looked up you have explained me to myself harry he murmured with something of a sigh of relief
i felt all that you have said but somehow i was afraid of it and i could not express it to myself
how well you know me but we will not talk again of what has happened it has been a marvellous experience
that is all i wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous life has everything in store for you mr_dorian_gray
there is nothing that you with your extraordinary good look will not be able to do but suppose harry i became haggard and old and wrinkled
what then ah then said lord_henry_wotton rising to go then my dear mr_dorian_gray you would have to fight for your victories
as it is they are brought to you no you must keep your good look we live in an age that reads too much to be wise and that thinks too much to be beautiful
we cannot spare you and now you had better dress and drive down to the club we are rather late as it is
i think i shall join you at the opera harry i feel too tired to eat anything what is the number of your sister box
twenty seven i believe it is on the grand tier you will see her name on the door but i am sorry you wont come and dine
i dont feel up to it said mr_dorian_gray listlessly but i am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me
you are certainly my best friend no one has ever understood me as you have we are only at the beginning of our friendship mr_dorian_gray answered lord_henry_wotton shaking him by the hand
as he closed the door behind him mr_dorian_gray touched the bell and in a few minutes victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down
good bye i shall see you before nine thirty i hope remember patti is singing he waited impatiently for him to go
the man seemed to take an interminable time over everything as soon as he had left he rushed to the screen and drew it back
no there was no further change in the picture it had received the news of sibyl_vane death before he had known of it himself
the vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had no doubt appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison whatever it was
it was conscious of the events of life as they occurred or was it indifferent to results did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul
he wondered and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his very eye shuddering as he hoped it
poor sibyl_vane what a romance it had all been she had often mimicked death on the stage then death himself had touched her and taken her with him
how had she played that dreadful last scene had she cursed him as she died no she had died for love of him and love would always be a sacrament to him now
he would not think any more of what she had made him go through on that horrible night at the theatre
when he thought of her it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the world stage to show the supreme reality of love
she had atoned for everything by the sacrifice she had made of her life a wonderful tragic figure tears came to his eye as he remembered her childlike look and winsome fanciful way and shy tremulous grace
he brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture he felt that the time had really come for making his choice
or had his choice already been made yes life had decided that for him life and his own infinite curiosity about life
eternal youth infinite passion pleasure subtle and secret wild joy and wilder sin he was to have all these thing the portrait was to bear the burden of his shame that was all
a feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas
once in boyish mockery of narcissus he had kissed or feigned to kiss those painted lip that now smiled so cruelly at him
morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty almost enamoured of it as it seemed to him at time
was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing to be hidden away in a locked room to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair
was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded the pity of it the pity of it for a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease
and yet who that knew anything about life would surrender the chance of remaining always young however fantastic that chance might be or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught
it had changed in answer to a prayer perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged besides was it really under his control
had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all
if thought could exercise its influence upon a living organism might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic thing
nay without thought or conscious desire might not thing external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passion atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity
but the reason was of no importance he would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power if the picture was to alter it was to alter
that was all why inquire too closely into it for there would be a real pleasure in watching it he would be able to follow his mind into its secret place
this portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors as it had revealed to him his own body so it would reveal to him his own soul
when the blood crept from its face and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eye he would keep the glamour of boyhood
and when winter came upon it he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade
not one pulse of his life would ever weaken like the gods of the greeks he would be strong and fleet and joyous
he drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture smiling as he did so and passed into his bedroom where his valet was already waiting for him
what did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas he would be safe that was everything an hour later he was at the opera and lord_henry_wotton was leaning over his chair
chapter as he was sitting at breakfast next morning basil_hallward was shown into the room i am so glad i have found you mr_dorian_gray he said gravely
i called last night and they told me you were at the opera of course i knew that was impossible
but i wish you had left word where you had really gone to i passed a dreadful evening half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another
i read of it quite by chance in a late edition of the globe that i picked up at the club
i think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first i came here at once and was miserable at not finding you
i cant tell you how heart broken i am about the whole thing i know what you must suffer but where were you
did you go down and see the girl mother for a moment i thought of following you there they gave the address in the paper
somewhere in the euston road isnt it but i was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that i could not lighten
poor woman what a state she must be in and her only child too what did she say about it all
my dear basil_hallward how do i know murmured mr_dorian_gray sipping some pale yellow wine from a delicate gold beaded bubble of venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored
i was at the opera you should have come on there i met lady gwendolen harry sister for the first time
we were in her box she is perfectly charming and patti sang divinely dont talk about horrid subjects if one doesnt talk about a thing it has never happened
it is simply expression as harry says that gives reality to thing i may mention that she was not the woman only child
there is a son a charming fellow i believe but he is not on the stage he is a sailor or something
and now tell me about yourself and what you are painting you went to the opera said basil_hallward speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his voice
you can talk to me of other woman being charming and of patti singing divinely before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in
you went to the opera while sibyl_vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging why man there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers
stop basil_hallward i wont hear it cried mr_dorian_gray leaping to his foot you must not tell me about thing
what is done is done what is past is past you call yesterday the past what has the actual lapse of time got to do with it
it is only shallow people who require year to get rid of an emotion a man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure
i dont want to be at the mercy of my emotions i want to use them to enjoy them and to dominate them
you look exactly the same wonderful boy who day after day used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture
mr_dorian_gray this is horrible something has changed you completely but you were simple natural and affectionate then you were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world
now i dont know what has come over you you talk as if you had no heart no pity in you
the lad flushed up and going to the window looked out for a few moment on the green flickering sun lashed garden
it is all harry influence i see that i owe a great deal to harry basil_hallward he said at last more than i owe to you
you only taught me to be vain well i am punished for that mr_dorian_gray or shall be some day i dont know what you mean basil_hallward he exclaimed turning round
i dont know what you want what do you want i want the mr_dorian_gray i used to paint said the artist sadly
basil_hallward said the lad going over to him and putting his hand on his shoulder you have come too late
yesterday when i heard that sibyl_vane had killed herself killed herself good heavens is there no doubt about that cried basil_hallward looking up at him with an expression of horror
my dear basil_hallward surely you dont think it was a vulgar accident of course she killed herself the elder man buried his face in his hand
how fearful he muttered and a shudder ran through him no said mr_dorian_gray there is nothing fearful about it
it is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age as a rule people who act lead the most commonplace life
they are good husbands or faithful wives or something tedious you know what i mean middle class virtue and all that kind of thing
how different sibyl_vane was she lived her finest tragedy she was always a heroine the last night she played the night you saw her she acted badly because she had known the reality of love
when she knew its unreality she died as juliet might have died she passed again into the sphere of art there is something of the martyr about her
her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom all its wasted beauty but as i was saying you must not think i have not suffered
if you had come in yesterday at a particular moment about half past five perhaps or a quarter to six you would have found me in tears
even harry who was here who brought me the news in fact had no idea what i was going through i suffered immensely
then it passed away i cannot repeat an emotion no one can except sentimentalists and you are awfully unjust basil_hallward you come down here to console me
you remind me of a story harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty year of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed or some unjust law altered i forget exactly what it was
that is charming of you you find me consoled and you are furious how like a sympathetic person finally he succeeded and nothing could exceed his disappointment
and besides my dear old basil_hallward if you really want to console me teach me rather to forget what has happened or to see it from a proper artistic point of view
he had absolutely nothing to do almost died of ennui and became a confirmed misanthrope was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des art
well i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life
i remember picking up a little vellum covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase i love beautiful thing that one can touch and handle
old brocades green bronzes lacquer work carved ivories exquisite surroundings luxury pomp there is much to be got from all these but the artistic temperament that they create or at any rate reveal is still more to me
to become the spectator of one own life as harry says is to escape the suffering of life i know you are surprised at my talking to you like this
you have not realized how i have developed i was a schoolboy when you knew me i am a man now
i have new passion new thoughts new ideas i am different but you must not like me less i am changed but you must always be my friend
of course i am very fond of harry but i know that you are better than he is you are not stronger you are too much afraid of life but you are better
and how happy we used to be together dont leave me basil_hallward and dont quarrel with me i am what i am
there is nothing more to be said the painter felt strangely moved the lad was infinitely dear to him and his personality had been the great turning point in his art
he could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more after all his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away
well mr_dorian_gray he said at length with a sad smile i wont speak to you again about this horrible thing after to day
there was so much in him that was good so much in him that was noble i only trust your name wont be mentioned in connection with it
the inquest is to take place this afternoon have they summoned you mr_dorian_gray shook his head and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word inquest
there was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind they dont know my name he answered
but surely she did only my christian name and that i am quite sure she never mentioned to any one
she told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who i was and that she invariably told them my name was prince_charming
i should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic word
it was pretty of her you must do me a drawing of sibyl_vane basil_hallward i will try and do something mr_dorian_gray if it would please you
but you must come and sit to me yourself again i cant get on without you i can never sit to you again basil_hallward
it is impossible he exclaimed starting back the painter stared at him my dear boy what nonsense he cried
do you mean to say you dont like what i did of you where is it why have you pulled the screen in front of it
let me look at it it is the best thing i have ever done do take the screen away mr_dorian_gray it is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that
i felt the room looked different as i came in my servant has nothing to do with it basil_hallward you dont imagine i let him arrange my room for me
he settles my flowers for me sometimes that is all no i did it myself the light was too strong on the portrait
too strong surely not my dear fellow it is an admirable place for it let me see it and basil_hallward walked towards the corner of the room
a cry of terror broke from mr_dorian_gray lip and he rushed between the painter and the screen basil_hallward he said looking very pale you must not look at it
i dont wish you to not look at my own work you are not serious why shouldnt i look at it
if you try to look at it basil_hallward on my word of honour i will never speak to you again as long as i live
exclaimed basil_hallward laughing i am quite serious i dont offer any explanation and you are not to ask for any
but remember if you touch this screen everything is over between us basil_hallward was thunderstruck he looked at mr_dorian_gray in absolute amazement
he had never seen him like this before the lad was actually pallid with rage his hand were clenched and the pupils of his eye were like disks of blue fire
of course i wont look at it if you dont want me to he said rather coldly turning on his heel and going over towards the window
but really it seems rather absurd that i shouldnt see my own work especially as i am going to exhibit it in paris in the autumn
he was trembling all over mr_dorian_gray dont speak but what is the matter i shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that
so i must see it some day and why not to day to exhibit it you want to exhibit it exclaimed mr_dorian_gray a strange sense of terror creeping over him
was the world going to be shown his secret were people to gape at the mystery of his life that was impossible
georges petit is going to collect all my best picture for a special exhibition in the rue de seze which will open the first week in october
something he did not know what had to be done at once yes i dont suppose you will object to that the portrait will only be away a month
i should think you could easily spare it for that time in fact you are sure to be out of town
and if you keep it always behind a screen you cant care much about it mr_dorian_gray passed his hand over his forehead
there were beads of perspiration there he felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger you told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it he cried
why have you changed your mind you people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have
you cant have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition
the only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless you told harry exactly the same thing he stopped suddenly and a gleam of light came into his eye
he remembered that lord_henry_wotton had said to him once half seriously and half in jest if you want to have a strange quarter of an hour get basil_hallward to tell you why he wont exhibit your picture
he told me why he wouldnt and it was a revelation to me yes perhaps basil_hallward too had his secret
basil_hallward he said coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face we have each of us a secret
he would ask him and try let me know yours and i shall tell you mine what was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture
the painter shuddered in spite of himself mr_dorian_gray if i told you you might like me less than you do and you would certainly laugh at me
i could not bear your doing either of those two thing if you wish me never to look at your picture again i am content
i have always you to look at if you wish the best work i have ever done to be hidden from the world i am satisfied
your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation no basil_hallward you must tell me insisted mr_dorian_gray
i think i have a right to know his feeling of terror had passed away and curiosity had taken its place
he was determined to find out basil_hallward mystery let us sit down mr_dorian_gray said the painter looking troubled let us sit down
have you noticed in the picture something curious something that probably at first did not strike you but that revealed itself to you suddenly
basil_hallward cried the lad clutching the arm of his chair with trembling hand and gazing at him with wild startled eye
and just answer me one question i see you did dont speak wait till you hear what i have to say
mr_dorian_gray from the moment i met you your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me i was dominated soul brain and power by you
you became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artist like an exquisite dream i worshipped you
i grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke i wanted to have you all to myself i was only happy when i was with you
when you were away from me you were still present in my art of course i never let you know anything about this
i only knew that i had seen perfection face to face and that the world had become wonderful to my eye too wonderful perhaps for in such mad worships there is peril the peril of losing them no less than the peril of keeping them
it would have been impossible you would not have understood it i hardly understood it myself weeks and weeks went on and i grew more and more absorbed in you
then came a new development i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour and as adonis with huntsman cloak and polished boar spear
you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water silent silver the marvel of your own face
crowned with heavy lotus blossoms you had sat on the prow of adrian_singleton barge gazing across the green turbid nile and it had all been what art should be unconscious ideal and remote
one day a fatal day i sometimes think i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are not in the costume of dead age but in your own dress and in your own time
whether it was the realism of the method or the mere wonder of your own personality thus directly presented to me without mist or veil i cannot tell
but i know that as i worked at it every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret
i grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry i felt mr_dorian_gray that i had told too much that i had put too much of myself into it
then it was that i resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited you were a little annoyed but then you did not realize all that it meant to me
harry to whom i talked about it laughed at me but i did not mind that when the picture was finished and i sat alone with it i felt that i was right
well after a few day the thing left my studio and as soon as i had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence it seemed to me that i had been foolish in imagining that i had seen anything in it more than that you were extremely good looking and that i could paint
even now i cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates
art is always more abstract than we fancy form and colour tell us of form and colour that is all it often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him
and so when i got this offer from paris i determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition
it never occurred to me that you would refuse i see now that you were right the picture cannot be shown
you must not be angry with me mr_dorian_gray for what i have told you as i said to harry once you are made to be worshipped
mr_dorian_gray drew a long breath the colour came back to his cheeks and a smile played about his lip
yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend
the peril was over he was safe for the time lord_henry_wotton had the charm of being very dangerous but that was all
he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry
was that one of the thing that life had in store it is extraordinary to me mr_dorian_gray said basil_hallward that you should have seen this in the portrait
did you really see it i saw something in it he answered something that seemed to me very curious well you dont mind my looking at the thing now
mr_dorian_gray shook his head you must not ask me that basil_hallward i could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture
you will some day surely never well perhaps you are right and now good bye mr_dorian_gray you have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art
whatever i have done that is good i owe to you ah you dont know what it cost me to tell you all that i have told you
my dear basil_hallward said mr_dorian_gray what have you told me simply that you felt that you admired me too much
that is not even a compliment it was not intended as a compliment it was a confession now that i have made it something seems to have gone out of me
perhaps one should never put one worship into word it was a very disappointing confession why what did you expect mr_dorian_gray
you didnt see anything else in the picture did you there was nothing else to see no there was nothing else to see
why do you ask but you mustnt talk about worship it is foolish you and i are friend basil_hallward and we must always remain so
you have got harry said the painter sadly oh harry cried the lad with a ripple of laughter
harry spends his day in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable just the sort of life i would like to lead
but still i dont think i would go to harry if i were in trouble i would sooner go to you basil_hallward
you will sit to me again impossible you spoil my life as an artist by refusing mr_dorian_gray no man comes across two ideal thing
few come across one i cant explain it to you basil_hallward but i must never sit to you again there is something fatal about a portrait
it has a life of its own i will come and have tea with you that will be just as pleasant
pleasanter for you i am afraid murmured basil_hallward regretfully and now good bye i am sorry you wont let me look at the picture once again
but that cant be helped i quite understand what you feel about it as he left the room mr_dorian_gray smiled to himself
and how strange it was that instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret he had succeeded almost by chance in wresting a secret from his friend
the painter absurd fits of jealousy his wild devotion his extravagant panegyrics his curious reticences he understood them all now and he felt sorry
poor basil_hallward how little he knew of the true reason how much that strange confession explained to him there seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance
he sighed and touched the bell the portrait must be hidden away at all costs he could not run such a risk of discovery again
it had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain even for an hour in a room to which any of his friend had access
chapter when his servant entered he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen
the man was quite impassive and waited for his orders mr_dorian_gray lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it
he could see the reflection of victor face perfectly it was like a placid mask of servility there was nothing to be afraid of there
speaking very slowly he told him to tell the house keeper that he wanted to see her and then to go to the frame maker and ask him to send two of his man round at once
yet he thought it best to be on his guard it seemed to him that as the man left the room his eye wandered in the direction of the screen
after a few moment in her black silk dress with old fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled hand mrs leaf bustled into the library
or was that merely his own fancy he asked her for the key of the schoolroom the old schoolroom mr_dorian_gray she exclaimed
why it is full of dust i must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it it is not fit for you to see sir
it is not indeed i dont want it put straight leaf i only want the key well sir you ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it
why it hasnt been opened for nearly five year not since his lordship died he winced at the mention of his grandfather
he had hateful memories of him that does not matter he answered i simply want to see the place that is all
and here is the key sir said the old lady going over the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hand
give me the key here is the key i ll have it off the bunch in a moment but you dont think of living up there sir and you so comfortable here
no no he cried petulantly thank you leaf that will do she lingered for a few moment and was garrulous over some detail of the household
he sighed and told her to manage thing as she thought best she left the room wreathed in smiles as the door closed mr_dorian_gray put the key in his pocket and looked round the room
his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold a splendid piece of late seventeenth century venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near bologna
yes that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in it had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead
now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own worse than the corruption of death itself something that would breed horrors and yet would never die
what the worm was to the corpse his sin would be to the painted image on the canvas they would mar its beauty and eat away its grace
they would defile it and make it shameful and yet the thing would still live on it would be always alive
he shuddered and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil_hallward the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away
basil_hallward would have helped him to resist lord_henry_wotton influence and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament
it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the sense and that dies when the sense tire
the love that he bore him for it was really love had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual it was such love as michelangelo had known and montaigne and winckelmann and shakespeare himself
yes basil_hallward could have saved him but it was too late now the past could always be annihilated regret denial or forgetfulness could do that
there were passion in him that would find their terrible outlet dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real
he took up from the couch the great purple and gold texture that covered it and holding it in his hand passed behind the screen
but the future was inevitable was the face on the canvas viler than before it seemed to him that it was unchanged and yet his loathing of it was intensified
gold hair blue eye and rose red lip they all were there it was simply the expression that had altered that was horrible in its cruelty
compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke how shallow basil_hallward reproaches about sibyl_vane had been how shallow and of what little account
his own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and calling him to judgement a look of pain came across him and he flung the rich pall over the picture
as he did so a knock came to the door he passed out as his servant entered the persons are here monsieur
he felt that the man must be got rid of at once he must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to
sitting down at the writing table he scribbled a note to lord_henry_wotton asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at eight fifteen that evening
there was something sly about him and he had thoughtful treacherous eye wait for an answer he said handing it to him and show the man in here
in two or three minutes there was another knock and mr hubbard himself the celebrated frame maker of south audley street came in with a somewhat rough looking young assistant
mr hubbard was a florid red whiskered little man whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artist who dealt with him
as a rule he never left his shop he waited for people to come to him but he always made an exception in favour of mr_dorian_gray
there was something about mr_dorian_gray that charmed everybody it was a pleasure even to see him what can i do for you mr_dorian_gray
he said rubbing his fat freckled hand i thought i would do myself the honour of coming round in person
i have just got a beauty of a frame sir picked it up at a sale old florentine came from fonthill i believe
admirably suited for a religious subject mr_dorian_gray i am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round mr hubbard
i shall certainly drop in and look at the frame though i dont go in much at present for religious art but to day i only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me
it is rather heavy so i thought i would ask you to lend me a couple of your man
no trouble at all mr_dorian_gray i am delighted to be of any service to you which is the work of art sir
this replied mr_dorian_gray moving the screen back can you move it covering and all just as it is i dont want it to get scratched going upstairs
there will be no difficulty sir said the genial frame maker beginning with the aid of his assistant to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended
and now where shall we carry it to mr_dorian_gray i will show you the way mr hubbard if you will kindly follow me
or perhaps you had better go in front i am afraid it is right at the top of the house we will go up by the front staircase as it is wider
the elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky and now and then in spite of the obsequious protests of mr hubbard who had the true tradesman spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful mr_dorian_gray put his hand to it so as to help them
he held the door open for them and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent something of a load to carry sir gasped the little man when they reached the top landing
i am afraid it is rather heavy murmured mr_dorian_gray as he unlocked the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eye of man
he had not entered the place for more than four year not indeed since he had used it first as a play room when he was a child and then as a study when he grew somewhat older
it was a large well proportioned room which had been specially built by the last lord kelso for the use of the little grandson whom for his strange likeness to his mother and also for other reason he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance
there was the huge italian cassone with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy
and he wiped his shiny forehead it appeared to mr_dorian_gray to have but little changed there the satinwood book case filled with his dog eared schoolbooks
on the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden while a company of hawkers rode by carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists
how well he remembered it all every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round he recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life and it seemed horrible to him that it was here
the fatal portrait was to be hidden away how little he had thought in those dead day of all that was in store for him
but there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eye as this he had the key and no one else could enter it
beneath its purple pall the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial sodden and unclean what did it matter no one could see it
he himself would not see it why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul he kept his youth that was enough
and besides might not his nature grow finer after all there was no reason that the future should be so full of shame
some love might come across his life and purify him and shield him from those sin that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh those curious unpictured sin whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm
perhaps some day the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth and he might show to the world basil_hallward masterpiece
no that was impossible hour by hour and week by week the thing upon the canvas was growing old it might escape the hideousness of sin but the hideousness of age was in store for it
the hair would lose its brightness the mouth would gape or droop would be foolish or gross as the mouths of old man are
there would be the wrinkled throat the cold blue veined hand the twisted body that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood
the cheeks would become hollow or flaccid yellow crow foot would creep round the fading eye and make them horrible the picture had to be concealed
there was no help for it bring it in mr hubbard please he said wearily turning round i am sorry i kept you so long
i was thinking of something else always glad to have a rest mr_dorian_gray answered the frame maker who was still gasping for breath
where shall we put it sir oh anywhere here this will do i dont want to have it hung up
just lean it against the wall thanks might one look at the work of art sir mr_dorian_gray started it would not interest you mr hubbard he said keeping his eye on the man
he felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life
i shant trouble you any more now i am much obliged for your kindness in coming round not at all not at all mr_dorian_gray
and mr hubbard tramped downstairs followed by the assistant who glanced back at mr_dorian_gray with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face
ever ready to do anything for you sir he had never seen any one so marvellous when the sound of their footsteps had died away mr_dorian_gray locked the door and put the key in his pocket
he felt safe now no one would ever look upon the horrible thing no eye but his would ever see his shame
on reaching the library he found that it was just after five clock and that the tea had been already brought up
on a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre a present from lady radley his guardian wife a pretty professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in cairo was lying a note from lord_henry_wotton and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled
a copy of the third edition of the st james_vane gazette had been placed on the tea tray it was evident that victor had returned
he wondered if he had met the man in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing
he would be sure to miss the picture had no doubt missed it already while he had been laying the tea thing the screen had not been set back and a blank space was visible on the wall
perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room it was a horrible thing to have a spy in one house
he had heard of rich man who had been blackmailed all their life by some servant who had read a letter or overheard a conversation or picked up a card with an address or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace
it was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper and a book that might interest him and that he would be at the club at eight fifteen
he sighed and having poured himself out some tea opened lord_henry_wotton note he opened the st james_vane languidly and looked through it
an actress an inquest was held this morning at the bell tavern hoxton road by mr danby the district coroner on the body of sibyl_vane a young actress recently engaged at the royal theatre holborn
a red pencil mark on the fifth page caught his eye it drew attention to the following paragraph inquest on a verdict of death by misadventure was returned
considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence and that of dr birrell who had made the post mortem examination of the deceased
he frowned and tearing the paper in two went across the room and flung the pieces away how ugly it all was
and how horribly real ugliness made thing he felt a little annoyed with lord_henry_wotton for having sent him the report
and it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil victor might have read it the man knew more than enough english for that
perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something and yet what did it matter what had mr_dorian_gray to do with sibyl_vane death
there was nothing to fear mr_dorian_gray had not killed her his eye fell on the yellow book that lord_henry_wotton had sent him
he went towards the little pearl coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver and taking up the volume flung himself into an arm chair and began to turn over the leaves
what was it he wondered after a few minutes he became absorbed it was the strangest book that he had ever read
it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment and to the delicate sound of flutes the sin of the world were passing in dumb show before him
thing that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him thing of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed
it was a novel without a plot and with only one character being indeed simply a psychological study of a certain young parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passion and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own and to sum up as it were in himself the various moods through which the world spirit had ever passed loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that man have unwisely called virtue as much as those natural rebellions that wise man still call sin
the style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style vivid and obscure at once full of argot and of archaisms of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases that characterizes the work of some of the finest artist of the french school of symbolistes
there were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour the life of the sense was described in the terms of mystical philosophy
one hardly knew at time whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner
it was a poisonous book the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain
the mere cadence of the sentences the subtle monotony of their music so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated produced in the mind of the lad as he passed from chapter to chapter a form of reverie a malady of dreaming that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows
cloudless and pierced by one solitary star a copper green sky gleamed through the window he read on by its wan light till he could read no more
then after his valet had reminded him several time of the lateness of the hour he got up and going into the next room placed the book on the little florentine table that always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner
it was almost nine clock before he reached the club where he found lord_henry_wotton sitting alone in the morning room looking very much bored
i am so sorry harry he cried but really it is entirely your fault that book you sent me so fascinated me that i forgot how the time was going
yes i thought you would like it replied his host rising from his chair i didnt say i liked it harry
i said it fascinated me there is a great difference ah you have discovered that murmured lord_henry_wotton and they passed into the dining room
chapter for year mr_dorian_gray could not free himself from the influence of this book or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it
he procured from paris no less than nine large paper copies of the first edition and had them bound in different colours so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed at time to have almost entirely lost control
the hero the wonderful young parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself
and indeed the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life written before he had lived it
he never knew never indeed had any cause to know that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors and polished metal surfaces and still water which came upon the young parisian so early in his life and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once apparently been so remarkable
it was with an almost cruel joy and perhaps in nearly every joy as certainly in every pleasure cruelty has its place that he used to read the latter part of the book with its really tragic if somewhat overemphasized account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others and the world he had most dearly valued
in one point he was more fortunate than the novel fantastic hero for the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated basil_hallward and many others besides him seemed never to leave him
even those who had heard the most evil thing against him and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through london and became the chatter of the clubs could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him
he had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world man who talked grossly became silent when mr_dorian_gray entered the room
there was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them his mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished
they wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual
often on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friend or thought that they were so he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room open the door with the key that never left him now and stand with a mirror in front of the portrait that basil_hallward had painted of him looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass
he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul
he would examine with minute care and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth wondering sometimes which were the more horrible the signs of sin or the signs of age
the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure he would place his white hand beside the coarse bloated hand of the picture and smile
there were moment indeed at night when lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber or in the sordid room of the little ill famed tavern near the docks which under an assumed name and in disguise it was his habit to frequent he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish
that curiosity about life which lord_henry_wotton had first stirred in him as they sat together in the garden of their friend seemed to increase with gratification
he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs but moment such as these were rare the more he knew the more he desired to know
he had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them yet he was not really reckless at any rate in his relations to society
once or twice every month during the winter and on each wednesday evening while the season lasted he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art
his little dinners in the settling of which lord_henry_wotton always assisted him were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers and embroidered cloths and antique plate of gold and silver
indeed there were many especially among the very young man who saw or fancied that they saw in mr_dorian_gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in eton or oxford day a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world
to them he seemed to be of the company of those whom dante describes as having sought to make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty
and certainly to him life itself was the first the greatest of the art and for it all the other art seemed to be but a preparation
fashion by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal and dandyism which in its own way is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty had of course their fascination for him
his mode of dressing and the particular styles that from time to time he affected had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the mayfair balls and pall mall club window who copied him in everything that he did and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful though to him only half serious fopperies
for while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age and found indeed a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the london of his own day what to imperial neronian rome the author of the satyricon once had been yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel or the knotting of a necktie or the conduct of a cane
he sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles and find in the spiritualizing of the sense its highest realization
the worship of the sense has often and with much justice been decried man feeling a natural instinct of terror about passion and sensations that seem stronger than themselves and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence
but it appeared to mr_dorian_gray that the true nature of the sense had never been understood and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic
like gautier he was one for whom the visible world existed as he looked back upon man moving through history he was haunted by a feeling of loss
there had been mad wilful rejections monstrous forms of self torture and self denial whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which in their ignorance they had sought to escape nature in her wonderful irony driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions
yes there was to be as lord_henry_wotton had prophesied a new hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having in our own day its curious revival
it was to have its service of the intellect certainly yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience
its aim indeed was to be experience itself and not the fruits of experience sweet or bitter as they might be
so much had been surrendered and to such little purpose of the asceticism that deadens the sense as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them it was to know nothing
but it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moment of a life that is itself but a moment
there are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn either after one of those dreamless night that make us almost enamoured of death or one of those night of horror and misshapen joy when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques and that lends to gothic art its enduring vitality this art being one might fancy especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie
gradually white fingers creep through the curtains and they appear to tremble in black fantastic shapes dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there
outside there is the stirring of birds among the leaves or the sound of man going forth to their work or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave
veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted and by degrees the forms and colours of thing are restored to them and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern
the flameless tapers stand where we had left them and beside them lies the half cut book that we had been studying or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball or the letter that we had been afraid to read or that we had read too often
the wan mirrors get back their mimic life nothing seems to us changed out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known
we have to resume it where we had left off and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits or a wild longing it may be that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure a world in which thing would have fresh shapes and colours and be changed or have other secret a world in which the past would have little or no place or survive at any rate in no conscious form of obligation or regret the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain
it was the creation of such world as these that seemed to mr_dorian_gray to be the true object or amongst the true objects of life and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature abandon himself to their subtle influences and then having as it were caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament and that indeed according to certain modern psychologists is often a condition of it
it was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the roman catholic communion and certainly the roman ritual had always a great attraction for him
the daily sacrifice more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the sense as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize
he loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest in his stiff flowered dalmatic slowly and with white hand moving aside the veil of the tabernacle or raising aloft the jewelled lantern shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at time one would fain think is indeed the panis caelestis the bread of angels or robed in the garments of the passion of christ breaking the host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sin
the fuming censers that the grave boy in their lace and scarlet tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him
as he passed out he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to man and woman whispering through the worn grating the true story of their life
but he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system or of mistaking for a house in which to live an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail
mysticism with its marvellous power of making common thing strange to us and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it moved him for a season and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the darwinismus movement in germany and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passion of man to some pearly cell in the brain or some white nerve in the body delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions morbid or healthy normal or diseased
yet as has been said of him before no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself
he felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment he knew that the sense no less than the soul have their spiritual mysteries to reveal
and so he would now study perfumes and the secret of their manufacture distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the east
he saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life and set himself to discover their true relations wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical and in ambergris that stirred one passion and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances and in musk that troubled the brain and in champak that stained the imagination and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes and to estimate the several influences of sweet smelling roots and scented pollen laden flowers of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods of spikenard that sickens of hovenia that makes man mad and of aloes that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul
at another time he devoted himself entirely to music and in a long latticed room with a vermilion and gold ceiling and walls of olive green lacquer he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers or grave yellow shawled tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes while grinning negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and crouching upon scarlet mats slim turbaned indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed or feigned to charm great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders
the harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at time when schubert grace and chopin beautiful sorrows and the mighty harmonies of beethoven himself fell unheeded on his ear
he collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with western civilizations and loved to touch and try them
he had the mysterious juruparis of the rio negro indians that woman are not allowed to look at and that even youth may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging and the earthen jars of the peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds and flutes of human bones such as alfonso de ovalle heard in chile and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness
he had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken the long clarin of the mexicans into which the performer does not blow but through which he inhales the air the harsh ture of the amazon tribes that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees and can be heard it is said at a distance of three leagues the teponaztli that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants the yotl bells of the aztecs that are hung in clusters like grapes and a huge cylindrical drum covered with the skins of great serpents like the one that bernal diaz saw when he went with cortes into the mexican temple and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description
the fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art like nature has her monsters thing of bestial shape and with hideous voice
yet after some time he wearied of them and would sit in his box at the opera either alone or with lord_henry_wotton listening in rapt pleasure to tannhauser and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul
on one occasion he took up the study of jewels and appeared at a costume ball as anne de joyeuse admiral of france in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls
he would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected such as the olive green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver the pistachio coloured peridot rose pink and wine yellow topazes carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous four rayed stars flame red cinnamon stones orange and violet spinels and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire
he loved the red gold of the sunstone and the moonstone pearly whiteness and the broken rainbow of the milky opal
he procured from amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs
this taste enthralled him for year and indeed may be said never to have left him he discovered wonderful stories also about jewels
in alphonso clericalis disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eye of real jacinth and in the romantic history of alexander the conqueror of emathia was said to have found in the vale of jordan snakes with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs
there was a gem in the brain of the dragon philostratus told us and by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain

the ducal hat of charles the rash the last duke of burgundy of his race was hung with pear shaped pearls and studded with sapphires
how exquisite life had once been how gorgeous in its pomp and decoration even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful
then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill room of the northern nations of europe
as he investigated the subject and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful thing
summer followed summer and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many time and night of horror repeated the story of their shame but he was unchanged

he longed to see the curious table napkins wrought for the priest of the sun on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast the mortuary cloth of king chilperic with its three hundred golden bees the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with lions panthers bears dogs forests rocks hunters all in fact that a painter can copy from nature and the coat that charles of orleans once wore on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning madame je suis tout joyeux the musical accompaniment of the word being wrought in gold thread and each note of square shape in those day formed with four pearls
he read of the room that was prepared at the palace at rheims for the use of queen joan of burgundy and was decorated with thirteen hundred and twenty one parrots made in broidery and blazoned with the king arm and five hundred and sixty one butterflies whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arm of the queen the whole worked in gold
where had they passed to catherine de medicis had a mourning bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns
its curtains were of damask with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver
the state bed of sobieski king of poland was made of smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the koran
louis xiv had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen foot high in his apartment its supports were of silver gilt beautifully chased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions
it had been taken from the turkish camp before vienna and the standard of mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy
and so for a whole year he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work getting the dainty delhi muslins finely wrought with gold thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles wings
the dacca gauzes that from their transparency are known in the east as woven air and running water and evening dew strange figured cloths from java elaborate yellow chinese hangings book bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with fleurs de lis birds and images veils of lacis worked in hungary point sicilian brocades and stiff spanish velvets georgian work with its gilt coins and japanese foukousas with their green toned gold and their marvellously plumaged birds
he had a special passion also for ecclesiastical vestments as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the church
in the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the bride of christ who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self inflicted pain
he possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold thread damask figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six petalled formal blossoms beyond which on either side was the pine apple device wrought in seed pearls
the orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the virgin and the coronation of the virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood
another cope was of green velvet embroidered with heart shaped groups of acanthus leaves from which spread long stemmed white blossoms the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals
the orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs among whom was st sebastian
he had chasubles also of amber coloured silk and blue silk and gold brocade and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold figured with representations of the passion and crucifixion of christ and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs de lis altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen and many corporals chalice veils and sudaria
this was italian work of the fifteenth century the morse bore a seraph head in gold thread raised work in the mystic offices to which such thing were put there was something that quickened his imagination
modes by which he could escape for a season from the fear that seemed to him at time to be almost too great to be borne
upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood he had hung with his own hand the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life and in front of it had draped the purple and gold pall as a curtain
for weeks he would not go there would forget the hideous painted thing and get back his light heart his wonderful joyousness his passionate absorption in mere existence
then suddenly some night he would creep out of the house go down to dreadful place near blue gate fields and stay there day after day until he was driven away
on his return he would sit in front of the picture sometimes loathing it and himself but filled at other time with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own
after a few year he could not endure to be long out of england and gave up the villa that he had shared at trouville with lord_henry_wotton as well as the little white walled in house at algiers where they had more than once spent the winter
he hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life and was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the room in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door
for these treasures and everything that he collected in his lovely house were to be to him means of forgetfulness he was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing
it was true that the portrait still preserved under all the foulness and ugliness of the face its marked likeness to himself but what could they learn from that
he would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him he had not painted it what was it to him
how vile and full of shame it looked even if he told them would they believe it yet he was afraid
sometimes when he was down at his great house in nottinghamshire entertaining the fashionable young man of his own rank who were his chief companions and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there
what if it should be stolen the mere thought made him cold with horror surely the world would know his secret then
he was very nearly blackballed at a west end club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member and it was said that on one occasion when he was brought by a friend into the smoking room of the churchill the duke of berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out
perhaps the world already suspected it for while he fascinated many there were not a few who distrusted him curious stories became current about him after he had passed his twenty fifth year
it was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of whitechapel and that he consorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade
his extraordinary absences became notorious and when he used to reappear again in society man would whisper to each other in corners or pass him with a sneer or look at him with cold searching eye as though they were determined to discover his secret
of such insolences and attempted slights he of course took no notice and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner his charming boyish smile and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies for so they termed them that were circulated about him
it was remarked however that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared after a time to shun him
woman who had wildly adored him and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if mr_dorian_gray entered the room
yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eye of many his strange and dangerous charm his great wealth was a certain element of security
society civilized society at least is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating
it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals and in its opinion the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef
and after all it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner or poor wine is irreproachable in his private life
even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half cold entrees as lord_henry_wotton remarked once in a discussion on the subject and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view
for the canons of good society are or should be the same as the canons of art form is absolutely essential to it
it should have the dignity of a ceremony as well as its unreality and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us
is insincerity such a terrible thing i think not it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities
he used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple permanent reliable and of one essence
to him man was a being with myriad life and myriad sensations a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead
he loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture gallery of his country house and look at the various portrait of those whose blood flowed in his veins
here was philip herbert described by francis osborne in his memoires on the reigns of queen elizabeth and king james_vane as one who was caressed by the court for his handsome face which kept him not long company
such at any rate was mr_dorian_gray opinion was it young herbert life that he sometimes led had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own
was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly and almost without cause give utterance in basil_hallward studio to the mad prayer that had so changed his life
here in gold embroidered red doublet jewelled surcoat and gilt edged ruff and wristbands stood sir anthony sherard with his silver and black armour piled at his foot
what had this man legacy been had the lover of giovanna of naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame
were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize here from the fading canvas smiled lady elizabeth devereux in her gauze hood pearl stomacher and pink slashed sleeves
a flower was in her right hand and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses on a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple
there were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes he knew her life and the strange stories that were told about her lovers
had he something of her temperament in him these oval heavy lidded eye seemed to look curiously at him what of george willoughby with his powdered hair and fantastic patches
how evil he looked the face was saturnine and swarthy and the sensual lip seemed to be twisted with disdain delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hand that were so overladen with rings
what of the second lord beckenham the companion of the prince regent in his wildest day and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with mrs fitzherbert
he had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century and the friend in his youth of lord ferrars how proud and handsome he was with his chestnut curls and insolent pose
what passion had he bequeathed the world had looked upon him as infamous he had led the orgies at carlton house
the star of the garter glittered upon his breast beside him hung the portrait of his wife a pallid thin lipped woman in black
her blood also stirred within him how curious it all seemed and his mother with her lady hamilton face and her moist wine dashed lip he knew what he had got from her
he had got from her his beauty and his passion for the beauty of others she laughed at him in her loose bacchante dress
there were vine leaves in her hair the purple spilled from the cup she was holding the carnations of the painting had withered but the eye were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour
yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one own race nearer perhaps in type and temperament many of them and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious
there were time when it appeared to mr_dorian_gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life not as he had lived it in act and circumstance but as his imagination had created it for him as it had been in his brain and in his passion
he felt that he had known them all those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety
they seemed to follow him wherever he went it seemed to him that in some mysterious way their life had been his own
in the seventh chapter he tells how crowned with laurel lest lightning might strike him he had sat as tiberius in a garden at capri reading the shameful book of elephantis while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the flute player mocked the swinger of the censer and as caligula had caroused with the green shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel frontleted horse and as domitian had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors looking round with haggard eye for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his day and sick with that ennui that terrible taedium vitae that comes on those to whom life denies nothing and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silver shod mules been carried through the street of pomegranates to a house of gold and heard man cry on nero caesar as he passed by and as elagabalus had painted his face with colours and plied the distaff among the woman and brought the moon from carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the sun
over and over again mr_dorian_gray used to read this fantastic chapter and the two chapters immediately following in which as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad
filippo duke of milan who slew his wife and painted her lip with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled pietro barbi the venetian known as paul the second who sought in his vanity to assume the title of formosus and whose tiara valued at two hundred

as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of perugia those who had hated him could not choose but weep and atalanta who had cursed him blessed him
the hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had himself known this curious fancy there was a horrible fascination in them all
the renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain
he saw them at night and they troubled his imagination in the day mr_dorian_gray had been poisoned by a book
there were moment when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful
chapter it was on the ninth of november the eve of his own thirty eighth birthday as he often remembered afterwards
he was walking home about eleven clock from lord_henry_wotton where he had been dining and was wrapped in heavy furs as the night was cold and foggy
at the corner of grosvenor square and south audley street a man passed him in the mist walking very fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up
he had a bag in his hand mr_dorian_gray recognized him it was basil_hallward a strange sense of fear for which he could not account came over him
he made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house but basil_hallward had seen him
mr_dorian_gray heard him first stopping on the pavement and then hurrying after him in a few moment his hand was on his arm
mr_dorian_gray what an extraordinary piece of luck i have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine clock
finally i took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed as he let me out i am off to paris by the midnight train and i particularly wanted to see you before i left
i thought it was you or rather your fur coat as you passed me but i wasnt quite sure didnt you recognize me
in this fog my dear basil_hallward why i cant even recognize grosvenor square i believe my house is somewhere about here but i dont feel at all certain about it
i am sorry you are going away as i have not seen you for age but i suppose you will be back soon
i intend to take a studio in paris and shut myself up till i have finished a great picture i have in my head
no i am going to be out of england for six months however it wasnt about myself i wanted to talk
here we are at your door let me come in for a moment i have something to say to you i shall be charmed
but wont you miss your train said mr_dorian_gray languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his latch key
the lamplight struggled out through the fog and basil_hallward looked at his watch i have heaps of time he answered
the train doesnt go till twelve fifteen and it is only just eleven in fact i was on my way to the club to look for you when i met you
you see i shant have any delay about luggage as i have sent on my heavy thing all i have with me is in this bag and i can easily get to victoria in twenty minutes
mr_dorian_gray looked at him and smiled what a way for a fashionable painter to travel a gladstone bag and an ulster
come in or the fog will get into the house and mind you dont talk about anything serious nothing is serious nowadays
at least nothing should be basil_hallward shook his head as he entered and followed mr_dorian_gray into the library there was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth
the lamps were lit and an open dutch silver spirit case stood with some siphons of soda water and large cut glass tumblers on a little marqueterie table
you see your servant made me quite at home mr_dorian_gray he gave me everything i wanted including your best gold tipped cigarettes
he is a most hospitable creature i like him much better than the frenchman you used to have what has become of the frenchman by the bye
mr_dorian_gray shrugged his shoulders i believe he married lady radley maid and has established her in paris as an english dressmaker
anglomania is very fashionable over there now i hear it seems silly of the french doesnt it but do you know he was not at all a bad servant
i never liked him but i had nothing to complain about one often imagines thing that are quite absurd he was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away
have another brandy and soda or would you like hock and seltzer i always take hock and seltzer myself there is sure to be some in the next room
thanks i wont have anything more said the painter taking his cap and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the corner
and now my dear fellow i want to speak to you seriously dont frown like that you make it so much more difficult for me
what is it all about cried mr_dorian_gray in his petulant way flinging himself down on the sofa i hope it is not about myself
i am tired of myself to night i should like to be somebody else it is about yourself answered basil_hallward in his grave deep voice and i must say it to you
i shall only keep you half an hour mr_dorian_gray sighed and lit a cigarette half an hour he murmured
it is not much to ask of you mr_dorian_gray and it is entirely for your own sake that i am speaking
i think it right that you should know that the most dreadful thing are being said against you in london
i dont wish to know anything about them i love scandals about other people but scandals about myself dont interest me
they have not got the charm of novelty they must interest you mr_dorian_gray every gentleman is interested in his good name
you dont want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded of course you have your position and your wealth and all that kind of thing
but position and wealth are not everything mind you i dont believe these rumours at all at least i cant believe them when i see you
sin is a thing that writes itself across a man face it cannot be concealed people talk sometimes of secret vices
if a wretched man has a vice it shows itself in the lines of his mouth the droop of his eyelids the moulding of his hand even
there are no such thing somebody i wont mention his name but you know him came to me last year to have his portrait done
i had never seen him before and had never heard anything about him at the time though i have heard a good deal since
he offered an extravagant price i refused him there was something in the shape of his fingers that i hated i know now that i was quite right in what i fancied about him
his life is dreadful but you mr_dorian_gray with your pure bright innocent face and your marvellous untroubled youth i cant believe anything against you
and yet i see you very seldom and you never come down to the studio now and when i am away from you and i hear all these hideous thing that people are whispering about you
why is it mr_dorian_gray that a man like the duke of berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it
i dont know what to say why is it that so many gentlemen in london will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs
your name happened to come up in conversation in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the dudley
staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes but that you were a man whom no pure minded girl should be allowed to know and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with
you used to be a friend of lord staveley i met him at dinner last week i reminded him that i was a friend of yours and asked him what he meant
he told me he told me right out before everybody it was horrible why is your friendship so fatal to young man
there was that wretched boy in the guards who committed suicide you were his great friend there was sir henry ashton who had to leave england with a tarnished name
you and he were inseparable what about adrian_singleton and his dreadful end what about lord kent only son and his career
i met his father yesterday in st james_vane street he seemed broken with shame and sorrow what about the young duke of perth
you are talking about thing of which you know nothing said mr_dorian_gray biting his lip and with a note of infinite contempt in his voice
what sort of life has he got now what gentleman would associate with him stop basil_hallward you ask me why berwick leaves a room when i enter it
it is because i know everything about his life not because he knows anything about mine with such blood as he has in his veins how could his record be clean
you ask me about henry ashton and young perth did i teach the one his vices and the other his debauchery
if kent silly son takes his wife from the streets what is that to me if adrian_singleton writes his friend name across a bill am i his keeper
the middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinner table and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander
in this country it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him
i know how people chatter in england and what sort of life do these people who pose as being moral lead themselves
my dear fellow you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite mr_dorian_gray cried basil_hallward that is not the question
england is bad enough i know and english society is all wrong that is the reason why i want you to be fine
you have not been fine one has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friend
yours seem to lose all sense of honour of goodness of purity you have filled them with a madness for pleasure
they have gone down into the depths you led them there yes you led them there and yet you can smile as you are smiling now
and there is worse behind i know you and harry are inseparable surely for that reason if for none other you should not have made his sister name a by word
take care basil_hallward you go too far i must speak and you must listen you shall listen when you met lady gwendolen not a breath of scandal had ever touched her
is there a single decent woman in london now who would drive with her in the park why even her children are not allowed to live with her
then there are other stories stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful house and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in london
are they true can they be true when i first heard them i laughed i hear them now and they make me shudder
what about your country house and the life that is led there mr_dorian_gray you dont know what is said about you i wont tell you that i dont want to preach to you
i remember harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that and then proceeded to break his word
i do want to preach to you i want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you
i want you to have a clean name and a fair record i want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with
dont shrug your shoulders like that dont be so indifferent you have a wonderful influence let it be for good not for evil
they say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after
i dont know whether it is so or not how should i know but it is said of you i am told thing that it seems impossible to doubt
he showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at mentone
lord gloucester was one of my greatest friend at oxford your name was implicated in the most terrible confession i ever read
i told him that it was absurd that i knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind
know you i wonder do i know you before i could answer that i should have to see your soul
to see my soul muttered mr_dorian_gray starting up from the sofa and turning almost white from fear yes answered basil_hallward gravely and with deep toned sorrow in his voice to see your soul
but only god can do that a bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lip of the younger man
you shall see it yourself to night he cried seizing a lamp from the table come it is your own handiwork
why shouldnt you look at it you can tell the world all about it afterwards if you choose nobody would believe you
if they did believe you they would like me all the better for it i know the age better than you do though you will prate about it so tediously
come i tell you you have chattered enough about corruption now you shall look on it face to face there was the madness of pride in every word he uttered
he felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous memory of what he had done
he stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner yes he continued coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into his stern eye i shall show you my soul
you shall see the thing that you fancy only god can see basil_hallward started back this is blasphemy mr_dorian_gray he cried
you must not say thing like that they are horrible and they dont mean anything you think so
he laughed again i know so as for what i said to you to night i said it for your good
you know i have been always a stanch friend to you dont touch me finish what you have to say
a twisted flash of pain shot across the painter face he paused for a moment and a wild feeling of pity came over him
after all what right had he to pry into the life of mr_dorian_gray if he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him how much he must have suffered
then he straightened himself up and walked over to the fire place and stood there looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame
i am waiting basil_hallward said the young man in a hard clear voice he turned round what i have to say is this he cried
you must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you if you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end i shall believe you
deny them mr_dorian_gray deny them cant you see what i am going through my god dont tell me that you are bad and corrupt and shameful
mr_dorian_gray smiled there was a curl of contempt in his lip come upstairs basil_hallward he said quietly
i keep a diary of my life from day to day and it never leaves the room in which it is written
i shall show it to you if you come with me i shall come with you mr_dorian_gray if you wish it
i see i have missed my train that makes no matter i can go to morrow but dont ask me to read anything to night
all i want is a plain answer to my question that shall be given to you upstairs i could not give it here
you will not have to read long chapter he passed out of the room and began the ascent basil_hallward following close behind
they walked softly as man do instinctively at night the lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase a rising wind made some of the window rattle
when they reached the top landing mr_dorian_gray set the lamp down on the floor and taking out the key turned it in the lock
you insist on knowing basil_hallward he asked in a low voice yes i am delighted he answered smiling
then he added somewhat harshly you are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me
you have had more to do with my life than you think and taking up the lamp he opened the door and went in
a cold current of air passed them and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange
he shuddered shut the door behind you he whispered as he placed the lamp on the table basil_hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression
a faded flemish tapestry a curtained picture an old italian cassone and an almost empty book case that was all that it seemed to contain besides a chair and a table
as mr_dorian_gray was lighting a half burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes
the room looked as if it had not been lived in for year a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting there was a damp odour of mildew
so you think that it is only god who sees the soul basil_hallward draw that curtain back and you will see mine
the voice that spoke was cold and cruel you are mad mr_dorian_gray or playing a part muttered basil_hallward frowning
then i must do it myself said the young man and he tore the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground
an exclamation of horror broke from the painter lip as he saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him
you wont there was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing good heavens it was mr_dorian_gray own face that he was looking at
the horror whatever it was had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty there was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth
the sodden eye had kept something of the loveliness of their blue the noble curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat
yes it was mr_dorian_gray himself but who had done it he seemed to recognize his own brushwork and the frame was his own design
the idea was monstrous yet he felt afraid he seized the lighted candle and held it to the picture in the left hand corner was his own name traced in long letters of bright vermilion
it was some foul parody some infamous ignoble satire he had never done that still it was his own picture he knew it and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice
his own picture what did it mean why had it altered he turned and looked at mr_dorian_gray with the eye of a sick man
his mouth twitched and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate he passed his hand across his forehead it was dank with clammy sweat
the young man was leaning against the mantelshelf watching him with that strange expression that one sees on the face of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting
there was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy there was simply the passion of the spectator with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eye
he had taken the flower out of his coat and was smelling it or pretending to do so what does this mean
year ago when i was a boy said mr_dorian_gray crushing the flower in his hand you met me flattered me and taught me to be vain of my good look
one day you introduced me to a friend of yours who explained to me the wonder of youth and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty
in a mad moment that even now i dont know whether i regret or not i made a wish perhaps you would call it a prayer
cried basil_hallward at last his own voice sounded shrill and curious in his ears i remember it oh how well i remember it
no the thing is impossible the room is damp mildew has got into the canvas the paints i used had some wretched mineral poison in them
i tell you the thing is impossible ah what is impossible murmured the young man going over to the window and leaning his forehead against the cold mist stained glass
you told me you had destroyed it i was wrong it has destroyed me i dont believe it is my picture
cant you see your ideal in it said mr_dorian_gray bitterly my ideal as you call it as you called it
there was nothing evil in it nothing shameful you were to me such an ideal as i shall never meet again
this is the face of a satyr it is the face of my soul christ what a thing i must have worshipped
it has the eye of a devil each of us has heaven and hell in him basil_hallward cried mr_dorian_gray with a wild gesture of despair
if it is true he exclaimed and this is what you have done with your life why you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be
basil_hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it my god he held the light up again to the canvas and examined it
the surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it it was from within apparently that the foulness and horror had come
through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away the rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful
his hand shook and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and lay there sputtering he placed his foot on it and put it out
then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his hand
good god mr_dorian_gray what a lesson what an awful lesson there was no answer but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window
pray mr_dorian_gray pray he murmured what is it that one was taught to say in one boyhood lead us not into temptation
forgive us our sin wash away our iniquities let us say that together the prayer of your pride has been answered
the prayer of your repentance will be answered also i worshipped you too much i am punished for it you worshipped yourself too much
we are both punished mr_dorian_gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear dimmed eye it is too late basil_hallward he faltered
it is never too late mr_dorian_gray let us kneel down and try if we cannot remember a prayer isnt there a verse somewhere though your sin be as scarlet yet i will make them as white as snow
those word mean nothing to me now hush dont say that you have done enough evil in your life
mr_dorian_gray glanced at the picture and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred for basil_hallward came over him as though it had been suggested to him by the image on the canvas whispered into his ear by those grinning lip
the mad passion of a hunted animal stirred within him and he loathed the man who was seated at the table more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything
my god dont you see that accursed thing leering at us he glanced wildly around something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced him
it was a knife that he had brought up some day before to cut a piece of cord and had forgotten to take away with him
his eye fell on it he knew what it was he moved slowly towards it passing basil_hallward as he did so
as soon as he got behind him he seized it and turned round basil_hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise
he rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear crushing the man head down on the table and stabbing again and again
there was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood three time the outstretched arm shot up convulsively waving grotesque stiff fingered hand in the air
he stabbed him twice more but the man did not move something began to trickle on the floor he waited for a moment still pressing the head down
then he threw the knife on the table and listened he could hear nothing but the drip drip on the threadbare carpet
he opened the door and went out on the landing the house was absolutely quiet no one was about for a few seconds he stood bending over the balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness
the thing was still seated in the chair straining over the table with bowed head and humped back and long fantastic arm
had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on the table one would have said that the man was simply asleep
then he took out the key and returned to the room locking himself in as he did so how quickly it had all been done
the wind had blown the fog away and the sky was like a monstrous peacock tail starred with myriads of golden eye
he looked down and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on the door of the silent house
he felt strangely calm and walking over to the window opened it and stepped out on the balcony the crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner and then vanished
a woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the railings staggering as she went now and then she stopped and peered back
once she began to sing in a hoarse voice the policeman strolled over and said something to her she stumbled away laughing
a bitter blast swept across the square the gas lamps flickered and became blue and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches to and fro
he shivered and went back closing the window behind him having reached the door he turned the key and opened it
he did not even glance at the murdered man he felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realize the situation
the friend who had painted the fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his life
it was a rather curious one of moorish workmanship made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished steel and studded with coarse turquoises
that was enough then he remembered the lamp perhaps it might be missed by his servant and questions would be asked
he hesitated for a moment then he turned back and took it from the table he could not help seeing the dead thing
how still it was how horribly white the long hand looked it was like a dreadful wax image having locked the door behind him he crept quietly downstairs
the woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain he stopped several time and waited no everything was still
it was merely the sound of his own footsteps when he reached the library he saw the bag and coat in the corner
he unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting a press in which he kept his own curious disguises and put them into it
they must be hidden away somewhere he could easily burn them afterwards then he pulled out his watch it was twenty minutes to two
he sat down and began to think every year every month almost man were strangled in england for what he had done there had been a madness of murder in the air
some red star had come too close to the earth and yet what evidence was there against him basil_hallward had left the house at eleven
no one had seen him come in again most of the servants were at selby royal his valet had gone to bed
paris yes it was to paris that basil_hallward had gone and by the midnight train as he had intended with his curious reserved habits it would be months before any suspicions would be roused
months everything could be destroyed long before then a sudden thought struck him he put on his fur coat and hat and went out into the hall
there he paused hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the bull eye reflected in the window
he waited and held his breath after a few moment he drew back the latch and slipped out shutting the door very gently behind him
then he began ringing the bell in about five minutes his valet appeared half dressed and looking very drowsy i am sorry to have had to wake you up francis he said stepping in
but i had forgotten my latch key what time is it ten minutes past two sir answered the man looking at the clock and blinking
ten minutes past two how horribly late you must wake me at nine to morrow i have some work to do
all right sir did any one call this evening mr basil_hallward sir he stayed here till eleven and then he went away to catch his train
oh i am sorry i didnt see him did he leave any message no sir except that he would write to you from paris if he did not find you at the club
that will do francis dont forget to call me at nine to morrow no sir the man shambled down the passage in his slippers
mr_dorian_gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library for a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room biting his lip and thinking
then he took down the blue book from one of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves alan_campbell hertford street mayfair
at nine clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters
yes that was the man he wanted chapter mr_dorian_gray was sleeping quite peacefully lying on his right side with one hand underneath his cheek
the man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke and as he opened his eye a faint smile passed across his lip as though he had been lost in some delightful dream
he looked like a boy who had been tired out with play or study yet he had not dreamed at all
his night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain but youth smiles without any reason it is one of its chiefest charms
he turned round and leaning upon his elbow began to sip his chocolate the mellow november sun came streaming into the room
the sky was bright and there was a genial warmth in the air it was almost like a morning in may
gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent blood stained foot into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness
he winced at the memory of all that he had suffered and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for basil_hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him and he grew cold with passion
the dead man was still sitting there too and in the sunlight now how horrible that was such hideous thing were for the darkness not for the day
there were sin whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passion and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy greater than any joy they brought or could ever bring to the sense
he felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad but this was not one of them
it was a thing to be driven out of the mind to be drugged with poppies to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself
when the half hour struck he passed his hand across his forehead and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and scarf pin and changing his rings more than once
he spent a long time also over breakfast tasting the various dishes talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at selby and going through his correspondence
at some of the letters he smiled three of them bored him one he read several time over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face
after he had drunk his cup of black coffee he wiped his lip slowly with a napkin motioned to his servant to wait and going over to the table sat down and wrote two letters
that awful thing a woman memory as lord_henry_wotton had once said one he put in his pocket the other he handed to the valet
take this round to hertford street francis and if mr alan_campbell is out of town get his address
as soon as he was alone he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper drawing first flowers and bits of architecture and then human face
suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to basil_hallward he frowned and getting up went over to the book case and took out a volume at hazard
he was determined that he would not think about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he should do so
when he had stretched himself on the sofa he looked at the title page of the book it was gautier emaux et camees charpentier japanese paper edition with the jacquemart etching
the binding was of citron green leather with a design of gilt trellis work and dotted pomegranates it had been given to him by adrian_singleton
as he turned over the pages his eye fell on the poem about the hand of lacenaire the cold yellow hand du supplice encore mal lavee with its downy red hairs and its doigts de faune
he glanced at his own white taper fingers shuddering slightly in spite of himself and passed on till he came to those lovely stanzas upon venice sur une gamme chromatique le sein de perles ruisselant la venus de adriatique sort de eau son corps rose et blanc
les domes sur azur des ondes suivant la phrase au pur contour enflent comme des gorges rondes que souleve un soupir amour
esquif aborde et me depose jetant son amarre au pilier devant une facade rose sur le marbre un escalier how exquisite they were
as one read them one seemed to be floating down the green water way of the pink and pearl city seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains
the mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise blue that follow one as one pushes out to the lido
the sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the opal and iris throated birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed campanile or stalk with such stately grace through the dim dust stained arcades
leaning back with half closed eye he kept saying over and over to himself devant une facade rose sur le marbre un escalier
he remembered the autumn that he had passed there and a wonderful love that had stirred him to mad delightful follies
but venice like oxford had kept the background for romance and to the true romantic background was everything or almost everything
the whole of venice was in those two lines there was romance in every place basil_hallward had been with him part of the time and had gone wild over tintoret
poor basil_hallward what a horrible way for a man to die he sighed and took up the volume again and tried to forget
he read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little cafe at smyrna where the hadjis sit counting their amber beads and
the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other he read of the obelisk in the place de la concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot lotus covered nile where there are sphinxes and rose red ibises and white vultures with gilded claws and crocodiles with small beryl eye that crawl over the green steaming mud he began to brood over those verses which drawing music from kiss stained marble tell of that curious statue that gautier compares to a contralto voice the monstre charmant that couches in the porphyry room of the louvre
but after a time the book fell from his hand he grew nervous and a horrible fit of terror came over him
what if alan_campbell should be out of england day would elapse before he could come back perhaps he might refuse to come
what could he do then every moment was of vital importance they had been great friend once five year before almost inseparable indeed
then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end when they met in society now it was only mr_dorian_gray who smiled alan_campbell never did
he was an extremely clever young man though he had no real appreciation of the visible art and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from mr_dorian_gray
at cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory and had taken a good class in the natural science tripos of his year
indeed he was still devoted to the study of chemistry and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long greatly to the annoyance of his mother who had set her heart on his standing for parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions
his dominant intellectual passion was for science he was an excellent musician however as well and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs
in fact it was music that had first brought him and mr_dorian_gray together music and that indefinable attraction that mr_dorian_gray seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished and indeed exercised often without being conscious of it
they had met at lady berkshire the night that rubinstein played there and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on
for eighteen months their intimacy lasted alan_campbell was always either at selby royal or in grosvenor square to him as to many others mr_dorian_gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life
but suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that alan_campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which mr_dorian_gray was present
he had changed too was strangely melancholy at time appeared almost to dislike hearing music and would never himself play giving as his excuse when he was called upon that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise
every day he seemed to become more interested in biology and his name appeared once or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious experiments
whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew and this was certainly true this was the man mr_dorian_gray was waiting for
every second he kept glancing at the clock as the minutes went by he became horribly agitated at last he got up and began to pace up and down the room looking like a beautiful caged thing
time seemed to him to be crawling with foot of lead while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice
he knew what was waiting for him there saw it indeed and shuddering crushed with dank hand his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into their cave
the brain had its own food on which it battened and the imagination made grotesque by terror twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving masks
he took long stealthy strides his hand were curiously cold the suspense became unbearable it was useless then suddenly time stopped for him
yes that blind slow breathing thing crawled no more and horrible thoughts time being dead raced nimbly on in front and dragged a hideous future from its grave and showed it to him
he stared at it its very horror made him stone at last the door opened and his servant entered he turned glazed eye upon him
mr alan_campbell sir said the man a sigh of relief broke from his parched lip and the colour came back to his cheeks
ask him to come in at once francis he felt that he was himself again his mood of cowardice had passed away
in a few moment alan_campbell walked in looking very stern and rather pale his pallor being intensified by his coal black hair and dark eyebrows
the man bowed and retired alan_campbell this is kind of you i thank you for coming i had intended never to enter your house again mr_dorian_gray
but you said it was a matter of life and death his voice was hard and cold he spoke with slow deliberation
he kept his hand in the pockets of his astrakhan coat and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted
there was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on mr_dorian_gray yes it is a matter of life and death alan_campbell and to more than one person
sit down alan_campbell took a chair by the table and mr_dorian_gray sat opposite to him the two man eye met
after a strained moment of silence he leaned across and said very quietly but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for alan_campbell in a locked room at the top of this house a room to which nobody but myself has access a dead man is seated at a table
in mr_dorian_gray there was infinite pity he knew that what he was going to do was dreadful he has been dead ten hours now
dont stir and dont look at me like that who the man is why he died how he died are matters that do not concern you
what you have to do is this stop mr_dorian_gray i dont want to know anything further whether what you have told me is true or not true doesnt concern me
i entirely decline to be mixed up in your life keep your horrible secret to yourself they dont interest me any more
alan_campbell they will have to interest you this one will have to interest you i am awfully sorry for you alan_campbell
but i cant help myself you are the one man who is able to save me i am forced to bring you into the matter
i have no option alan_campbell you are scientific you know about chemistry and thing of that kind you have made experiments
what you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left
nobody saw this person come into the house indeed at the present moment he is supposed to be in paris he will not be missed for months
you alan_campbell you must change him and everything that belongs to him into a handful of ashes that i may scatter in the air
when he is missed there must be no trace of him found here you are mad mr_dorian_gray ah i was waiting for you to call me mr_dorian_gray
you are mad i tell you mad to imagine that i would raise a finger to help you mad to make this monstrous confession
i will have nothing to do with this matter whatever it is do you think i am going to peril my reputation for you
what is it to me what devil work you are up to it was suicide alan_campbell i am glad of that
but who drove him to it you i should fancy do you still refuse to do this for me of course i refuse
i will have absolutely nothing to do with it i dont care what shame comes on you you deserve it all
i should not be sorry to see you disgraced publicly disgraced how dare you ask me of all man in the world to mix myself up in this horror
i should have thought you knew more about people characters your friend lord_henry_wotton cant have taught you much about psychology whatever else he has taught you
nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you you have come to the wrong man go to some of your friend
dont come to me alan_campbell it was murder i killed him you dont know what he had made me suffer whatever my life is he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than
poor harry has had he may not have intended it the result was the same murder good god mr_dorian_gray is that what you have come to
i shall not inform upon you it is not my business besides without my stirring in the matter you are certain to be arrested
nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid but i will have nothing to do with it you must have something to do with it
wait wait a moment listen to me only listen alan_campbell all i ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment
if in some hideous dissecting room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject
you go to hospitals and dead house and the horrors that you do there dont affect you you would not turn a hair
on the contrary you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world or gratifying intellectual curiosity or something of that kind
you would not believe that you were doing anything wrong what i want you to do is merely what you have often done before
indeed to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at and remember it is the only piece of evidence against me
if it is discovered i am lost and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me i have no desire to help you
you forget that i am simply indifferent to the whole thing it has nothing to do with me alan_campbell i entreat you
think of the position i am in just before you came i almost fainted with terror you may know terror yourself some day
no dont think of that look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view you dont inquire where the dead thing on which you experiment come from
dont inquire now i have told you too much as it is but i beg of you to do this we were friend once alan_campbell
dont speak about those day mr_dorian_gray they are dead the dead linger sometimes the man upstairs will not go away he is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arm
alan_campbell alan if you dont come to my assistance i am ruined why they will hang me alan_campbell dont you understand
they will hang me for what i have done there is no good in prolonging this scene i absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter
it is insane of you to ask me you refuse yes i entreat you alan_campbell it is useless the same look of pity came into mr_dorian_gray eye
then he stretched out his hand took a piece of paper and wrote something on it he read it over twice folded it carefully and pushed it across the table
having done this he got up and went over to the window alan_campbell looked at him in surprise and then took up the paper and opened it
as he read it his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair a horrible sense of sickness came over him
after two or three minutes of terrible silence mr_dorian_gray turned round and came and stood behind him putting his hand upon his shoulder
he felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow i am so sorry for you alan_campbell he murmured but you leave me no alternative
i have a letter written already here it is you see the address if you dont help me i must send it
if you dont help me i will send it you know what the result will be but you are going to help me
it is impossible for you to refuse now i tried to spare you you will do me the justice to admit that
you were stern harsh offensive you treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me no living man at any rate
i bore it all now it is for me to dictate terms alan_campbell buried his face in his hand and a shudder passed through him
yes it is my turn to dictate terms alan_campbell you know what they are the thing is quite simple come dont work yourself into this fever
the thing has to be done face it and do it a groan broke from alan_campbell lip and he shivered all over
the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony each of which was too terrible to be borne
he felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him
the hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead it was intolerable it seemed to crush him come alan_campbell you must decide at once
i cannot do it he said mechanically as though word could alter thing you must you have no choice
dont delay he hesitated a moment is there a fire in the room upstairs yes there is a gas fire with asbestos
i shall have to go home and get some thing from the laboratory no alan_campbell you must not leave the house
write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the thing back to you
alan_campbell scrawled a few lines blotted them and addressed an envelope to his assistant mr_dorian_gray took the note up and read it carefully
then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet with orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the thing with him
as the hall door shut alan_campbell started nervously and having got up from the chair went over to the chimney piece he was shivering with a kind of ague
for nearly twenty minutes neither of the man spoke a fly buzzed noisily about the room and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer
as the chime struck one alan_campbell turned round and looking at mr_dorian_gray saw that his eye were filled with tears
there was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him you are infamous absolutely infamous he muttered
hush alan_campbell you have saved my life said mr_dorian_gray your life good heavens what a life that is you have gone from corruption to corruption and now you have culminated in crime
in doing what i am going to do what you force me to do it is not of your life that i am thinking
ah alan_campbell murmured mr_dorian_gray with a sigh i wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that i have for you
after about ten minutes a knock came to the door and the servant entered carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps
he turned away as he spoke and stood looking out at the garden alan_campbell made no answer shall i leave the thing here sir
he asked alan_campbell yes said mr_dorian_gray and i am afraid francis that i have another errand for you
you must go down to richmond at once see harden personally and tell him to send twice as many orchids as i ordered and to have as few white one as possible
what is the name of the man at richmond who supplies selby with orchids harden sir yes harden in fact i dont want any white one
it is a lovely day francis and richmond is a very pretty place otherwise i wouldnt bother you about it no trouble sir
at what time shall i be back mr_dorian_gray looked at alan_campbell how long will your experiment take alan_campbell he said in a calm indifferent voice
the presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage alan_campbell frowned and bit his lip
it will take about five hours he answered it will be time enough then if you are back at half past seven francis
or stay just leave my thing out for dressing you can have the evening to yourself i am not dining at home so i shall not want you
thank you sir said the man leaving the room now alan_campbell there is not a moment to be lost how heavy this chest is
i ll take it for you you bring the other thing he spoke rapidly and in an authoritative manner alan_campbell felt dominated by him
they left the room together when they reached the top landing mr_dorian_gray took out the key and turned it in the lock
then he stopped and a troubled look came into his eye he shuddered i dont think i can go in alan_campbell he murmured
it is nothing to me i dont require you said alan_campbell coldly mr_dorian_gray half opened the door as he did so he saw the face of his portrait leering in the sunlight
he remembered that the night before he had forgotten for the first time in his life to hide the fatal canvas and was about to rush forward when he drew back with a shudder
what was that loathsome red dew that gleamed wet and glistening on one of the hand as though the canvas had sweated blood
how horrible it was more horrible it seemed to him for the moment than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred but was still there as he had left it
he heaved a deep breath opened the door a little wider and with half closed eye and averted head walked quickly in determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man
on the floor in front of it the torn curtain was lying then stooping down and taking up the gold and purple hanging he flung it right over the picture
there he stopped feeling afraid to turn round and his eye fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him
he heard alan_campbell bringing in the heavy chest and the irons and the other thing that he had required for his dreadful work
he began to wonder if he and basil_hallward had ever met and if so what they had thought of each other
he turned and hurried out just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that alan_campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face
leave me now said a stern voice behind him as he was going downstairs he heard the key being turned in the lock
it was long after seven when alan_campbell came back into the library he was pale but absolutely calm i have done what you asked me to do he muttered
and now good bye let us never see each other again you have saved me from ruin alan_campbell i cannot forget that said mr_dorian_gray simply
as soon as alan_campbell had left he went upstairs there was a horrible smell of nitric acid in the room but the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone
that evening at eight thirty exquisitely dressed and wearing a large button hole of parma violets mr_dorian_gray was ushered into lady_narborough drawing room by bowing servants
his forehead was throbbing with maddened nerves and he felt wildly excited but his manner as he bent over his hostess hand was as easy and graceful as ever
certainly no one looking at mr_dorian_gray that night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age
those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin nor those smiling lip have cried out on god and goodness
he himself could not help wondering at the calm of his demeanour and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life
it was a small party got up rather in a hurry by lady_narborough who was a very clever woman with what lord_henry_wotton used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness
she had proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors and having buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum which she had herself designed and married off her daughters to some rich rather elderly man she devoted herself now to the pleasure of french fiction french cookery and french esprit when she could get it
mr_dorian_gray was one of her especial favourites and she always told him that she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life
i know my dear i should have fallen madly in love with you she used to say and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake
chapter perhaps one never seems so much at one ease as when one has to play a part it is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time
as it was our bonnets were so unbecoming and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind that i never had even a flirtation with anybody
however that was all lady_narborough fault he was dreadfully short sighted and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything
the fact was as she explained to mr_dorian_gray behind a very shabby fan one of her married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her and to make matters worse had actually brought her husband with her
her guests this evening were rather tedious i think it is most unkind of her my dear she whispered
of course i go and stay with them every summer after i come from homburg but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes and besides i really wake them up
they get up early because they have so much to do and go to bed early because they have so little to think about
there has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of queen elizabeth and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner
you dont know what an existence they lead down there it is pure unadulterated country life you shant sit next either of them
you shall sit by me and amuse me mr_dorian_gray murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room yes it was certainly a tedious party
two of the people he had never seen before and the others consisted of ernest harrowden one of those middle aged mediocrities so common in london clubs who have no enemies but are thoroughly disliked by their friend lady ruxton an overdressed woman of forty seven with a hooked nose who was always trying to get herself compromised but was so peculiarly plain that to her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against her mrs erlynne a pushing nobody with a delightful lisp and venetian red hair lady alice chapman his hostess daughter a dowdy dull girl with one of those characteristic british face that once seen are never remembered and her husband a red cheeked white whiskered creature who like so many of his class was under the impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas
gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the mauve draped mantelshelf exclaimed how horrid of lord_henry_wotton to be so late
he was rather sorry he had come till lady_narborough looking at the great ormolu i sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to disappoint me
it was some consolation that harry was to be there and when the door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some insincere apology he ceased to feel bored
lady_narborough kept scolding him for what she called an insult to poor adolphe who invented the menu specially for you and
but at dinner he could not eat anything plate after plate went away untasted now and then lord_henry_wotton looked across at him wondering at his silence and abstracted manner
from time to time the butler filled his glass with champagne he drank eagerly and his thirst seemed to increase
mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton at last as the chaud froid was being handed round what is the matter with you to night you are quite out of sorts
i believe he is in love cried lady_narborough and that he is afraid to tell me for fear i should be jealous
dear lady_narborough murmured mr_dorian_gray smiling i have not been in love for a whole week not in fact since madame de ferrol left town
he is quite right i certainly should how you man can fall in love with that woman exclaimed the old lady
i really cannot understand it it is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl lady_narborough said lord_henry_wotton
she is the one link between us and your short frocks she does not remember my short frocks at all lord_henry_wotton
she is still decolletee he answered taking an olive in his long fingers and when she is in a very smart gown she look like an edition de luxe of a bad french novel
but i remember her very well at vienna thirty year ago and how decolletee she was then she is really wonderful and full of surprises
her capacity for family affection is extraordinary when her third husband died her hair turned quite gold from grief how can you harry cried mr_dorian_gray
it is a most romantic explanation laughed the hostess but her third husband lord_henry_wotton you dont mean to say ferrol is the fourth
certainly lady_narborough i dont believe a word of it well ask mr_dorian_gray he is one of her most intimate friend
is it true mr_dorian_gray she assures me so lady_narborough said mr_dorian_gray i asked her whether like marguerite de navarre she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle
she told me she didnt because none of them had had any hearts at all four husbands upon my word that is trop de zele
trop audace i tell her said mr_dorian_gray oh she is audacious enough for anything my dear and what is ferrol like
i dont know him the husbands of very beautiful woman belong to the criminal classes said lord_henry_wotton sipping his wine
lady_narborough hit him with her fan lord_henry_wotton i am not at all surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked
but what world says that asked lord_henry_wotton elevating his eyebrows it can only be the next world this world and i are on excellent terms
everybody i know says you are very wicked cried the old lady shaking her head lord_henry_wotton looked serious for some moment
it is perfectly monstrous he said at last the way people go about nowadays saying thing against one behind one back that are absolutely and entirely true
but really if you all worship madame de ferrol in this ridiculous way i shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion
isnt he incorrigible cried mr_dorian_gray leaning forward in his chair i hope so said his hostess laughing you will never marry again lady_narborough broke in lord_henry_wotton
you were far too happy when a woman marries again it is because she detested her first husband when a man marries again it is because he adored his first wife
woman try their luck man risk theirs lady_narborough wasnt perfect cried the old lady if he had been you would not have loved him my dear lady was the rejoinder
woman love us for our defects if we have enough of them they will forgive us everything even our intellects
you will never ask me to dinner again after saying this i am afraid lady_narborough but it is quite true
of course it is true lord_henry_wotton if we woman did not love you for your defects where would you all be
not one of you would ever be married you would be a set of unfortunate bachelors not however that that would alter you much
nowadays all the married man live like bachelors and all the bachelors like married man fin de siecle murmured lord_henry_wotton
fin du globe answered his hostess i wish it were fin du globe said mr_dorian_gray with a sigh
life is a great disappointment ah my dear cried lady_narborough putting on her gloves dont tell me that you have exhausted life
lord_henry_wotton is very wicked and i sometimes wish that i had been but you are made to be good you look so good
when a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him i must find you a nice wife lord_henry_wotton dont you think that mr_dorian_gray should get married
i am always telling him so lady_narborough said lord_henry_wotton with a bow well we must look out for a suitable match for him
i shall go through debrett carefully to night and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies with their age lady_narborough asked mr_dorian_gray
i want it to be what the morning post calls a suitable alliance and i want you both to be happy
of course with their age slightly edited but nothing must be done in a hurry what nonsense people talk about happy marriages exclaimed lord_henry_wotton
a man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her ah what a cynic you are
cried the old lady pushing back her chair and nodding to lady ruxton you must come and dine with me soon again
you are really an admirable tonic much better than what sir andrew prescribes for me you must tell me what people you would like to meet though
i want it to be a delightful gathering i like man who have a future and woman who have a past he answered
or do you think that would make it a petticoat party i fear so she said laughing as she stood up
a thousand pardons my dear lady ruxton she added i didnt see you hadnt finished your cigarette never mind lady_narborough
i smoke a great deal too much i am going to limit myself for the future pray dont lady ruxton said lord_henry_wotton
moderation is a fatal thing enough is as bad as a meal more than enough is as good as a feast
lady ruxton glanced at him curiously you must come and explain that to me some afternoon lord_henry_wotton it sounds a fascinating theory she murmured as she swept out of the room
now mind you dont stay too long over your politics and scandal cried lady_narborough from the door if you do we are sure to squabble upstairs
the man laughed and mr chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the table and came up to the top
mr_dorian_gray changed his seat and went and sat by lord_henry_wotton mr chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the situation in the house of commons
he guffawed at his adversaries the word doctrinaire word full of terror to the british mind reappeared from time to time between his explosions
the inherited stupidity of the race sound english common sense he jovially termed it was shown to be the proper bulwark for society
an alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory he hoisted the union jack on the pinnacles of thought a smile curved lord_henry_wotton lip and he turned round and looked at mr_dorian_gray
are you better my dear fellow he asked you seemed rather out of sorts at dinner i am quite well harry
i am tired that is all you were charming last night the little duchess is quite devoted to you she tells me she is going down to selby
she has promised to come on the twentieth is monmouth to be there too oh yes harry he bores me dreadfully almost as much as he bores her
she is very clever too clever for a woman she lacks the indefinable charm of weakness it is the foot of clay that make the gold of the image precious
her foot are very pretty but they are not foot of clay white porcelain foot if you like they have been through the fire and what fire does not destroy it hardens
i believe according to the peerage it is ten year but ten year with monmouth must have been like eternity with time thrown in
she has had experiences how long has she been married asked mr_dorian_gray an eternity she tells me who else is coming
oh the willoughbys lord rugby and his wife our hostess geoffrey_clouston the usual set i have asked lord grotrian
i like him said lord_henry_wotton a great many people dont but i find him charming he atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over educated
he is a very modern type i dont know if he will be able to come harry he may have to go to monte carlo with his father
ah what a nuisance people people are try and make him come by the way mr_dorian_gray you ran off very early last night
you left before eleven what did you do afterwards did you go straight home mr_dorian_gray glanced at him hurriedly and frowned
no harry he said at last i did not get home till nearly three did you go to the club
yes he answered then he bit his lip no i dont mean that i didnt go to the club
i walked about i forget what i did how inquisitive you are harry you always want to know what one has been doing
i always want to forget what i have been doing i came in at half past two if you wish to know the exact time
i had left my latch key at home and my servant had to let me in if you want any corroborative evidence on the subject you can ask him
lord_henry_wotton shrugged his shoulders my dear fellow as if i cared let us go up to the drawing room no sherry thank you mr chapman
something has happened to you mr_dorian_gray tell me what it is you are not yourself to night dont mind me harry i am irritable and out of temper
i shall come round and see you to morrow or next day make my excuses to lady_narborough i shant go upstairs
i shall go home i must go home all right mr_dorian_gray i dare say i shall see you to morrow at tea time
as he drove back to his own house he was conscious that the sense of terror he thought he had strangled had come back to him
the duchess is coming i will try to be there harry he said leaving the room lord_henry_wotton casual questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment and he wanted his nerve still
thing that were dangerous had to be destroyed he winced he hated the idea of even touching them yet it had to be done
he realized that and when he had locked the door of his library he opened the secret press into which he had thrust basil_hallward coat and bag
a huge fire was blazing he piled another log on it the smell of the singeing clothes and burning leather was horrible
at the end he felt faint and sick and having lit some algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier he bathed his hand and forehead with a cool musk scented vinegar
it took him three quarters of an hour to consume everything suddenly he started his eye grew strangely bright and he gnawed nervously at his underlip
between two of the window stood a large florentine cabinet made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis
he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed
his breath quickened a mad craving came over him he lit a cigarette and then threw it away his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek
at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying went over to it and having unlocked it touched some hidden spring
but he still watched the cabinet a triangular drawer passed slowly out his fingers moved instinctively towards it dipped in and closed on something
it was a small chinese box of black and gold dust lacquer elaborately wrought the sides patterned with curved waves and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads
he opened it inside was a green paste waxy in lustre the odour curiously heavy and persistent he hesitated for some moment with a strangely immobile smile upon his face
then shivering though the atmosphere of the room was terribly hot he drew himself up and glanced at the clock it was twenty minutes to twelve
as midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air mr_dorian_gray dressed commonly and with a muffler wrapped round his throat crept quietly out of his house
he put the box back shutting the cabinet door as he did so and went into his bedroom in bond street he found a hansom with a good horse
he hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address the man shook his head it is too far for me he muttered
all right sir answered the man you will be there in an hour and after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly towards the river
here is a sovereign for you said mr_dorian_gray you shall have another if you drive fast chapter
a cold rain began to fall and the blurred street lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist the public house were just closing and dim man and woman were clustering in broken groups round their door
lying back in the hansom with his hat pulled over his forehead mr_dorian_gray watched with listless eye the sordid shame of the great city and now and then he repeated to himself the word that lord_henry_wotton had said to him on the first day they had met to cure the soul by means of the sense and the sense by means of the soul
from some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter in others drunkards brawled and screamed yes that was the secret
there were opium dens where one could buy oblivion dens of horror where the memory of old sin could be destroyed by the madness of sin that were new
he had often tried it and would try it again now the moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull
from time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it the gas lamps grew fewer and the streets more narrow and gloomy
once the man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile a steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles
the sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a grey flannel mist to cure the soul by means of the sense and the sense by means of the soul
how the word rang in his ears his soul certainly was sick to death was it true that the sense could cure it
for that there was no atonement but though forgiveness was impossible forgetfulness was possible still and he was determined to forget to stamp the thing out to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one
innocent blood had been spilled what could atone for that ah indeed what right had basil_hallward to have spoken to him as he had done
who had made him a judge over others he had said thing that were dreadful horrible not to be endured on and on plodded the hansom going slower it seemed to him at each step
he thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster the hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him
his throat burned and his delicate hand twitched nervously together he struck at the horse madly with his stick the driver laughed and whipped up
he laughed in answer and the man was silent the way seemed interminable and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider
the monotony became unbearable and as the mist thickened he felt afraid then they passed by lonely brickfields the fog was lighter here and he could see the strange bottle shaped kilns with their orange fanlike tongues of fire
a dog barked as they went by and far away in the darkness some wandering sea gull screamed the horse stumbled in a rut then swerved aside and broke into a gallop
after some time they left the clay road and rattled again over rough paven streets most of the window were dark but now and then fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind
he watched them curiously they moved like monstrous marionettes and made gestures like live thing he hated them a dull rage was in his heart
as they turned a corner a woman yelled something at them from an open door and two man ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards
certainly with hideous iteration the bitten lip of mr_dorian_gray shaped and reshaped those subtle word that dealt with soul and sense till he had found in them the full expression as it were of his mood and justified by intellectual approval passion that without such justification would still have dominated his temper
from cell to cell of his brain crept the one thought and the wild desire to live most terrible of all man appetites quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre
ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made thing real became dear to him now for that very reason
the driver beat at them with his whip it is said that passion makes one think in a circle ugliness was the one reality
the coarse brawl the loathsome den the crude violence of disordered life the very vileness of thief and outcast were more vivid in their intense actuality of impression than all the gracious shapes of art the dreamy shadows of song
they were what he needed for forgetfulness in three day he would be free suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane
over the low roofs and jagged chimney stacks of the house rose the black masts of ships wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards
this will do he answered and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him he walked quickly in the direction of the quay
somewhere about here sir aint it he asked huskily through the trap mr_dorian_gray started and peered round here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman
the light shook and splintered in the puddles a red glare came from an outward bound steamer that was coaling the slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh
he hurried on towards the left glancing back now and then to see if he was being followed in about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories
in one of the top window stood a lamp he stopped and gave a peculiar knock after a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked
the door opened quietly and he went in without saying a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as he passed
at the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the street
he dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as if it had once been a third rate dancing saloon
shrill flaring gas jets dulled and distorted in the fly blown mirrors that faced them were ranged round the walls greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them making quivering disks of light
the floor was covered with ochre coloured sawdust trampled here and there into mud and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor
some malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove playing with bone counters and showing their white teeth as they chattered
in one corner with his head buried in his arm a sailor sprawled over a table and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard woman mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust
he thinks he got red ants on him laughed one of them as mr_dorian_gray passed by the man looked at her in terror and began to whimper
at the end of the room there was a little staircase leading to a darkened chamber as mr_dorian_gray hurried up its three rickety steps the heavy odour of opium met him
when he entered a young man with smooth yellow hair who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner
he heaved a deep breath and his nostrils quivered with pleasure you here adrian_singleton muttered mr_dorian_gray where else should i be
he answered listlessly none of the chaps will speak to me now i thought you had left england
darlington is not going to do anything my brother paid the bill at last george doesnt speak to me either
i dont care he added with a sigh as long as one has this stuff one doesnt want friend i think i have had too many friend
mr_dorian_gray winced and looked round at the grotesque thing that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses the twisted limbs the gaping mouths the staring lustreless eye fascinated him
he knew in what strange heavens they were suffering and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy
they were better off than he was he was prisoned in thought memory like a horrible malady was eating his soul away
from time to time he seemed to see the eye of basil_hallward looking at him yet he felt he could not stay
the presence of adrian_singleton troubled him he wanted to be where no one would know who he was he wanted to escape from himself
i am going on to the other place he said after a pause on the wharf yes that mad cat is sure to be there
they wont have her in this place now mr_dorian_gray shrugged his shoulders i am sick of woman who love one
woman who hate one are much more interesting besides the stuff is better much the same i like it better
come and have something to drink i must have something i dont want anything murmured the young man never mind
a half caste in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster grinned a hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them
adrian_singleton rose up wearily and followed mr_dorian_gray to the bar the woman sidled up and began to chatter mr_dorian_gray turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to adrian_singleton
a crooked smile like a malay crease writhed across the face of one of the woman we are very proud to night she sneered
for god sake dont talk to me cried mr_dorian_gray stamping his foot on the ground what do you want
two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman sodden eye then flickered out and left them dull and glazed
money here it is dont ever talk to me again she tossed her head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers
her companion watched her enviously it no use sighed adrian_singleton i dont care to go back what does it matter
i am quite happy here you will write to me if you want anything wont you said mr_dorian_gray after a pause
perhaps good night then good night answered the young man passing up the steps and wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief
as he drew the curtain aside a hideous laugh broke from the painted lip of the woman who had taken his money
mr_dorian_gray walked to the door with a look of pain in his face there goes the devil bargain she hiccoughed in a hoarse voice
curse you he answered dont call me that she snapped her fingers prince_charming is what you like to be called aint it
she yelled after him the drowsy sailor leaped to his foot as she spoke and looked wildly round the sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear
his meeting with adrian_singleton had strangely moved him and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door as basil_hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult
he rushed out as if in pursuit mr_dorian_gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain he bit his lip and for a few seconds his eye grew sad
yet after all what did it matter to him one day were too brief to take the burden of another errors on one shoulders
each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it the only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault
there are moment psychologists tell us when the passion for sin or for what the world calls sin so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body as every cell of the brain seems to be instinct with fearful impulses
one had to pay over and over again indeed in her dealings with man destiny never closed her accounts man and woman at such moment lose the freedom of their will
choice is taken from them and conscience is either killed or if it life at all life but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm
they move to their terrible end as automatons move for all sin as theologians weary not of reminding us are sin of disobedience
callous concentrated on evil with stained mind and soul hungry for rebellion mr_dorian_gray hastened on quickening his step as he went but as he darted aside into a dim archway that had served him often as a short cut to the ill famed place where he was going he felt himself suddenly seized from behind and before he had time to defend himself he was thrust back against the wall with a brutal hand round his throat
when that high spirit that morning star of evil fell from heaven it was as a rebel that he fell he struggled madly for life and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening fingers away
in a second he heard the click of a revolver and saw the gleam of a polished barrel pointing straight at his head and the dusky form of a short thick set man facing him
what do you want he gasped keep quiet said the man if you stir i shoot you
you are mad what have i done to you you wrecked the life of sibyl_vane was the answer and sibyl_vane was my sister
she killed herself i know it her death is at your door i swore i would kill you in return for year i have sought you
i had no clue no trace the two people who could have described you were dead i knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you
i heard it to night by chance make your peace with god for to night you are going to die mr_dorian_gray grew sick with fear
i never knew her he stammered i never heard of her you are mad you had better confess your sin for as sure as i am james_vane you are going to die
there was a horrible moment mr_dorian_gray did not know what to say or do down on your knees growled the man
i give you one minute to make your peace no more i go on board to night for india and i must do my job first
one minute that all mr_dorian_gray arm fell to his side paralysed with terror he did not know what to do
suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain stop he cried how long ago is it since your sister died
quick tell me eighteen year said the man why do you ask me what do year matter eighteen year laughed mr_dorian_gray with a touch of triumph in his voice
eighteen year set me under the lamp and look at my face james_vane hesitated for a moment not understanding what was meant
dim and wavering as was the wind blown light yet it served to show him the hideous error as it seemed into which he had fallen for the face of the man he had sought to kill
then he seized mr_dorian_gray and dragged him from the archway had all the bloom of boyhood all the unstained purity of youth
he seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers hardly older if older indeed at all than his sister had been when they had parted so many year ago
it was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life he loosened his hold and reeled back
my god my god he cried and i would have murdered you mr_dorian_gray drew a long breath you have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime my man he said looking at him sternly
let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hand forgive me sir muttered james_vane
you had better go home and put that pistol away or you may get into trouble said mr_dorian_gray turning on his heel and going slowly down the street
i was deceived a chance word i heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track james_vane stood on the pavement in horror
after a little while a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps
he was trembling from head to foot he felt a hand laid on his arm and looked round with a start
it was one of the woman who had been drinking at the bar why didnt you kill him she hissed out putting haggard face quite close to his
i knew you were following him when you rushed out from daly you fool you should have killed him he has lots of money and he as bad as bad
he is not the man i am looking for he answered and i want no man money i want a man life
the man whose life i want must be nearly forty now this one is little more than a boy thank god i have not got his blood upon my hand
the woman gave a bitter laugh little more than a boy she sneered why man it nigh on eighteen year since prince_charming made me what i am
you lie cried james_vane she raised her hand up to heaven before god i am telling the truth she cried
before god strike me dumb if it aint so he is the worst one that comes here they say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face
it nigh on eighteen year since i met him he hasnt changed much since then i have though she added with a sickly leer
you swear this i swear it came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth but dont give me away to him she whined i am afraid of him
let me have some money for my night lodging he broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street but mr_dorian_gray had disappeared
a week later mr_dorian_gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth who with her husband a jaded looking man of sixty was amongst his guests
it was tea time and the mellow light of the huge lace covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding
her white hand were moving daintily among the cups and her full red lip were smiling at something that mr_dorian_gray had whispered to her
when he looked back the woman had vanished also chapter lord_henry_wotton was lying back in a silk draped wicker chair looking at them
lady_narborough pretending to listen to the duke description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection
on a peach coloured divan sat three young man in elaborate smoking suits were handing tea cakes to some of the woman the house party consisted of twelve people and there were more expected to arrive on the next day
what are you two talking about said lord_henry_wotton strolling over to the table and putting his cup down
i hope mr_dorian_gray has told you about my plan for rechristening everything gladys it is a delightful idea but i dont want to be rechristened harry rejoined the duchess looking up at him with her wonderful eye
i am quite satisfied with my own name and i am sure mr_dorian_gray should be satisfied with his
my dear gladys i would not alter either name for the world they are both perfect i was thinking chiefly of flowers
yesterday i cut an orchid for my button hole it was a marvellous spotted thing as effective as the seven deadly sin
in a thoughtless moment i asked one of the gardeners what it was called he told me it was a fine specimen of robinsoniana or something dreadful of that kind
it is a sad truth but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely name to thing name are everything i never quarrel with actions
my one quarrel is with word that is the reason i hate vulgar realism in literature the man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one
it is the only thing he is fit for then what should we call you harry she asked his name is prince paradox said mr_dorian_gray
i recognize him in a flash exclaimed the duchess i wont hear of it laughed lord_henry_wotton sinking into a chair
from a label there is no escape i refuse the title royalties may not abdicate fell as a warning from pretty lip
you wish me to defend my throne then yes i give the truths of to morrow i prefer the mistakes of to day she answered
you disarm me gladys he cried catching the wilfulness of her mood of your shield harry not of your spear
i never tilt against beauty he said with a wave of his hand that is your error harry believe me
you value beauty far too much how can you say that i admit that i think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good
but on the other hand no one is more ready than i am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly
ugliness is one of the seven deadly sin then cried the duchess what becomes of your simile about the orchid
ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues gladys you as a good tory must not underrate them beer the bible and the seven deadly virtues have made our england what she is
you dont like your country then she asked i live in it that you may censure it the better
would you have me take the verdict of europe on it he inquired what do they say of us
that tartuffe has emigrated to england and opened a shop is that yours harry i give it to you i could not use it
it is too true you need not be afraid our countrymen never recognize a description they are practical
they are more cunning than practical when they make up their ledger they balance stupidity by wealth and vice by hypocrisy
still we have done great thing great thing have been thrust on us gladys we have carried their burden only as far as the stock exchange
she shook her head i believe in the race she cried it represents the survival of the pushing
it has development decay fascinates me more what of art she asked it is a malady love an illusion
religion the fashionable substitute for belief you are a sceptic never scepticism is the beginning of faith
what are you to define is to limit give me a clue threads snap you would lose your way in the labyrinth
you bewilder me let us talk of some one else our host is a delightful topic year ago he was christened prince_charming
ah dont remind me of that cried mr_dorian_gray our host is rather horrid this evening answered the duchess colouring
i believe he thinks that monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly
well i hope he wont stick pins into you duchess laughed mr_dorian_gray oh my maid does that already mr_dorian_gray when she is annoyed with me
and what does she get annoyed with you about duchess for the most trivial thing mr_dorian_gray i assure you
usually because i come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that i must be dressed by half past eight
how unreasonable of her you should give her warning i darent mr_dorian_gray why she invents hats for me
you remember the one i wore at lady hilstone garden party you dont but it is nice of you to pretend that you do
well she made it out of nothing all good hats are made out of nothing like all good reputations gladys interrupted lord_henry_wotton
every effect that one produces gives one an enemy to be popular one must be a mediocrity not with woman said the duchess shaking her head and woman rule the world
we woman as some one says love with our ears just as you man love with your eye if you ever love at all
i assure you we cant bear mediocrities it seems to me that we never do anything else murmured mr_dorian_gray
ah then you never really love mr_dorian_gray answered the duchess with mock sadness my dear gladys cried lord_henry_wotton
how can you say that romance life by repetition and repetition converts an appetite into an art besides each time that one love is the only time one has ever loved
we can have in life but one great experience at best and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible
difference of object does not alter singleness of passion it merely intensifies it even when one has been wounded by it harry asked the duchess after a pause
especially when one has been wounded by it answered lord_henry_wotton the duchess turned and looked at mr_dorian_gray with a curious expression in her eye
what do you say to that mr_dorian_gray she inquired mr_dorian_gray hesitated for a moment then he threw his head back and laughed
i always agree with harry duchess even when he is wrong harry is never wrong duchess and does his philosophy make you happy
i have never searched for happiness who wants happiness i have searched for pleasure and found it mr_dorian_gray often
too often the duchess sighed i am searching for peace she said and if i dont go and dress i shall have none this evening
let me get you some orchids duchess cried mr_dorian_gray starting to his foot and walking down the conservatory you are flirting disgracefully with him said lord_henry_wotton to his cousin
you had better take care he is very fascinating if he were not there would be no battle
greek meets greek then i am on the side of the trojans they fought for a woman they were defeated
there are worse thing than capture she answered you gallop with a loose rein pace gives life was the riposte
i shall write it in my diary to night what that a burnt child love the fire i am not even singed
my wings are untouched you use them for everything except flight courage has passed from man to woman it is a new experience for us
you have a rival who he laughed lady_narborough he whispered she perfectly adores him you fill me with apprehension
the appeal to antiquity is fatal to us who are romanticists romanticists you have all the methods of science
man have educated us but not explained you describe us as a sex was her challenge sphinxes without secret
she looked at him smiling how long mr_dorian_gray is she said let us go and help him i have not yet told him the colour of my frock
ah you must suit your frock to his flowers gladys that would be a premature surrender romantic art begins with its climax
i must keep an opportunity for retreat in the parthian manner they found safety in the desert i could not do that
woman are not always allowed a choice he answered but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall
and with fear in his eye lord_henry_wotton rushed through the flapping palms to find mr_dorian_gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon
everybody started up the duchess stood motionless in horror he was carried at once into the blue drawing room and laid upon one of the sofas
after a short time he came to himself and looked round with a dazed expression what has happened he asked
oh i remember am i safe here harry he began to tremble my dear mr_dorian_gray answered lord_henry_wotton you merely fainted
that was all you must have overtired yourself you had better not come down to dinner i will take your place
no i will come down he said struggling to his foot i would rather come down i must not be alone
there was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his manner as he sat at table but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him when he remembered that pressed against the window of the conservatory like a white handkerchief he had seen the face of james_vane watching him
the next day he did not leave the house and indeed spent most of the time in his own room sick with a wild terror of dying and yet indifferent to life itself
he went to his room and dressed chapter the consciousness of being hunted snared tracked down had begun to dominate him
the dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets
when he closed his eye he saw again the sailor face peering through the mist stained glass and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart
but perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him
if the tapestry did but tremble in the wind he shook actual life was chaos but there was something terribly logical in the imagination
it was the imagination that set remorse to dog the foot of sin it was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood
in the common world of fact the wicked were not punished nor the good rewarded success was given to the strong failure thrust upon the weak
that was all besides had any stranger been prowling round the house he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers
had any foot marks been found on the flower beds the gardeners would have reported it yes it had been merely fancy sibyl_vane brother had not come back to kill him
he had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea from him at any rate he was safe
why the man did not know who he was could not know who he was the mask of youth had saved him
and yet if it had been merely an illusion how terrible it was to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms and give them visible form and make them move before one
what sort of life would his be if day and night shadows of his crime were to peer at him from silent corners to mock him from secret place to whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep
as the thought crept through his brain he grew pale with terror and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder
oh in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend how ghastly the mere memory of the scene
he saw it all again each hideous detail came back to him with added horror out of the black cave of time terrible and swathed in scarlet rose the image of his sin
when lord_henry_wotton came in at six clock he found him crying as one whose heart will break it was not till the third day that he ventured to go out
there was something in the clear pine scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life
his own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm
but it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change with subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so
their strong passion must either bruise or bend they either slay the man or themselves die shallow sorrows and shallow love live on
besides he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror stricken imagination and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt
after breakfast he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden and then drove across the park to join the shooting party
the love and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude the crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass
at the corner of the pine wood he caught sight of sir geoffrey_clouston the duchess brother jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun
he jumped from the cart and having told the groom to take the mare home made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth
the sky was an inverted cup of blue metal a thin film of ice bordered the flat reed grown lake have you had good sport geoffrey_clouston
he asked not very good mr_dorian_gray i think most of the birds have gone to the open i dare say it will be better after lunch when we get to new ground
the keen aromatic air the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom
mr_dorian_gray strolled along by his side he was dominated by the carelessness of happiness by the high indifference of joy
suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them with black tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward started a hare
sir geoffrey_clouston put his gun to his shoulder but there was something in the animal grace of movement that strangely charmed mr_dorian_gray and he cried out at once dont shoot it geoffrey_clouston
it bolted for a thicket of alders let it live what nonsense mr_dorian_gray laughed his companion and as the hare bounded into the thicket he fired
there were two cries heard the cry of a hare in pain which is dreadful the cry of a man in agony which is worse
good heavens i have hit a beater exclaimed sir geoffrey_clouston what an ass the man was to get in front of the guns
stop shooting there he called out at the top of his voice a man is hurt the head keeper came running up with a stick in his hand
where sir where is he he shouted at the same time the firing ceased along the line here answered sir geoffrey_clouston angrily hurrying towards the thicket
why on earth dont you keep your man back spoiled my shooting for the day mr_dorian_gray watched them as they plunged into the alder clump brushing the lithe swinging branches aside
in a few moment they emerged dragging a body after them into the sunlight he turned away in horror it seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went
he heard sir geoffrey_clouston ask if the man was really dead and the affirmative answer of the keeper the wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with face
there was the trampling of myriad foot and the low buzz of voice a great copper breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead
after a few moment that were to him in his perturbed state like endless hours of pain he felt a hand laid on his shoulder
he started and looked round mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton i had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to day
it would not look well to go on i wish it were stopped for ever harry he answered bitterly the whole thing is hideous and cruel
is the man he could not finish the sentence i am afraid so rejoined lord_henry_wotton he got the whole charge of shot in his chest
he must have died almost instantaneously come let us go home they walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking
then mr_dorian_gray looked at lord_henry_wotton and said with a heavy sigh it is a bad omen harry a very bad omen
what is asked lord_henry_wotton oh this accident i suppose my dear fellow it cant be helped it was the man own fault
why did he get in front of the guns besides it is nothing to us it is rather awkward for geoffrey_clouston of course
it does not do to pepper beaters it makes people think that one is a wild shot and geoffrey_clouston is not he shoots very straight
but there is no use talking about the matter mr_dorian_gray shook his head it is a bad omen harry
i feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us to myself perhaps he added passing his hand over his eye with a gesture of pain
the elder man laughed the only horrible thing in the world is ennui mr_dorian_gray that is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness
but we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner i must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed
as for omens there is no such thing as an omen destiny does not send us heralds she is too wise or too cruel for that
besides what on earth could happen to you mr_dorian_gray you have everything in the world that a man can want there is no one who would not be delighted to change place with you
there is no one with whom i would not change place harry dont laugh like that i am telling you the truth
the wretched peasant who has just died is better off than i am i have no terror of death it is the coming of death that terrifies me
its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me good heavens dont you see a man moving behind the trees there watching me waiting for me
lord_henry_wotton looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was pointing yes he said smiling i see the gardener waiting for you
i suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to night how absurdly nervous you are my dear fellow
you must come and see my doctor when we get back to town mr_dorian_gray heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching
the man touched his hat glanced for a moment at lord_henry_wotton in a hesitating manner and then produced a letter which he handed to his master
her grace told me to wait for an answer he murmured mr_dorian_gray put the letter into his pocket tell her grace that i am coming in he said coldly
the man turned round and went rapidly in the direction of the house how fond woman are of doing dangerous thing laughed lord_henry_wotton
it is one of the qualities in them that i admire most a woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on
how fond you are of saying dangerous thing harry in the present instance you are quite astray i like the duchess very much but i dont love her
and the duchess love you very much but she likes you less so you are excellently matched you are talking scandal harry and there is never any basis for scandal
the basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty said lord_henry_wotton lighting a cigarette you would sacrifice anybody harry for the sake of an epigram
the world goes to the altar of its own accord was the answer i wish i could love cried mr_dorian_gray with a deep note of pathos in his voice
but i seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire i am too much concentrated on myself my own personality has become a burden to me
i want to escape to go away to forget it was silly of me to come down here at all i think i shall send a wire to harvey to have the yacht got ready
on a yacht one is safe safe from what mr_dorian_gray you are in some trouble why not tell me what it is
you know i would help you i cant tell you harry he answered sadly and i dare say it is only a fancy of mine
this unfortunate accident has upset me i have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me
what nonsense i hope it is but i cant help feeling it ah here is the duchess looking like artemis in a tailor made gown
you see we have come back duchess i have heard all about it mr_dorian_gray she answered poor geoffrey_clouston is terribly upset
and it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare how curious yes it was very curious i dont know what made me say it
some whim i suppose it looked the loveliest of little live thing but i am sorry they told you about the man
it is a hideous subject it is an annoying subject broke in lord_henry_wotton it has no psychological value at all
now if geoffrey_clouston had done the thing on purpose how interesting he would be i should like to know some one who had committed a real murder
how horrid of you harry cried the duchess isnt it mr_dorian_gray harry mr_dorian_gray is ill again he is going to faint
mr_dorian_gray drew himself up with an effort and smiled it is nothing duchess he murmured my nerves are dreadfully out of order
that is all i am afraid i walked too far this morning i didnt hear what harry said was it very bad
you must tell me some other time i think i must go and lie down you will excuse me wont you
they had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to the terrace as the glass door closed behind mr_dorian_gray lord_henry_wotton turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eye
are you very much in love with him he asked she did not answer for some time but stood gazing at the landscape
i wish i knew she said at last he shook his head knowledge would be fatal it is the uncertainty that charms one
a mist makes thing wonderful one may lose one way all way end at the same point my dear gladys
what is that disillusion it was my debut in life she sighed it came to you crowned
i am tired of strawberry leaves they become you only in public you would miss them said lord_henry_wotton
i will not part with a petal monmouth has ears old age is dull of hearing has he never been jealous
i wish he had been he glanced about as if in search of something what are you looking for
she inquired the button from your foil he answered you have dropped it she laughed i have still the mask
it makes your eye lovelier was his reply she laughed again her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit
upstairs in his own room mr_dorian_gray was lying on a sofa with terror in every tingling fibre of his body
the dreadful death of the unlucky beater shot in the thicket like a wild animal had seemed to him to pre figure death for himself also
life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear he had nearly swooned at what lord_henry_wotton had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting
at five clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his thing for the night express to town and to have the brougham at the door by eight thirty
he was determined not to sleep another night at selby royal it was an ill omened place death walked there in the sunlight
then he wrote a note to lord_henry_wotton telling him that he was going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in his absence
as he was putting it into the envelope a knock came to the door and his valet informed him that the head keeper wished to see him
the grass of the forest had been spotted with blood he frowned and bit his lip send him in he muttered after some moment hesitation
drawer and spread it out before him i suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning thornton
he said taking up a pen yes sir answered the gamekeeper was the poor fellow married had he any people dependent on him
if so i should not like them to be left in want and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary
asked mr_dorian_gray looking bored we dont know who he is sir that is what i took the liberty of coming to you about
dont know who he is said mr_dorian_gray listlessly what do you mean wasnt he one of your man no sir
never saw him before seems like a sailor sir the pen dropped from mr_dorian_gray hand and he felt as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating
a sailor he cried out did you say a sailor yes sir he look as if he had been a sort of sailor tattooed on both arm and that kind of thing
was there anything found on him said mr_dorian_gray leaning forward and looking at the man with startled eye anything that would tell his name
some money sir not much and a six shooter there was no name of any kind a decent looking man sir but rough like a sort of sailor we think
mr_dorian_gray started to his foot a terrible hope fluttered past him he clutched at it madly where is the body he exclaimed
quick i must see it at once it is in an empty stable in the home farm sir the folk dont like to have that sort of thing in their house
they say a corpse brings bad luck the home farm go there at once and meet me tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round
in less than a quarter of an hour mr_dorian_gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go
no never mind i ll go to the stables myself it will save time the trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path
once the mare swerved at a white gate post and nearly threw him he lashed her across the neck with his crop
she cleft the dusky air like an arrow the stones flew from her hoofs at last he reached the home farm
two man were loitering in the yard he leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them in the farthest stable a light was glimmering
something seemed to tell him that the body was there and he hurried to the door and put his hand upon the latch
there he paused for a moment feeling that he was on the brink of a discovery that would either make or mar his life
on a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers
then he thrust the door open and entered a spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face a coarse candle stuck in a bottle sputtered beside it
he felt that his could not be the hand to take the handkerchief away and called out to one of the farm servants to come to him
mr_dorian_gray shuddered take that thing off the face i wish to see it he said clutching at the door post for support
when the farm servant had done so he stepped forward a cry of joy broke from his lip the man who had been shot in the thicket was james_vane
he stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body as he rode home his eye were full of tears for he knew he was safe
there is no use your telling me that you are going to be good cried lord_henry_wotton dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled with rose water
chapter you are quite perfect pray dont change mr_dorian_gray shook his head no harry i have done too many dreadful thing in my life
i am not going to do any more i began my good actions yesterday where were you yesterday in the country harry
i was staying at a little inn by myself my dear boy said lord_henry_wotton smiling anybody can be good in the country
there are no temptations there that is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to
there are only two way by which man can reach it one is by being cultured the other by being corrupt
country people have no opportunity of being either so they stagnate culture and corruption echoed mr_dorian_gray i have known something of both
it seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together for i have a new ideal harry i am going to alter
i think i have altered you have not yet told me what your good action was or did you say you had done more than one
asked his companion as he spilled into his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and through a perforated shell shaped spoon snowed white sugar upon them
i can tell you harry it is not a story i could tell to any one else i spared somebody
it sounds vain but you understand what i mean she was quite beautiful and wonderfully like sibyl_vane i think it was that which first attracted me to her
you remember sibyl_vane dont you how long ago that seems well hetty was not one of our own class of course
she was simply a girl in a village but i really loved her i am quite sure that i loved her
all during this wonderful may that we have been having i used to run down and see her two or three time a week
yesterday she met me in a little orchard the apple blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair and she was laughing we were to have gone away together this morning at dawn
i should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure mr_dorian_gray interrupted lord_henry_wotton
suddenly i determined to leave her as flowerlike as i had found her but i can finish your idyll for you
you gave her good advice and broke her heart that was the beginning of your reformation harry you are horrible you mustnt say these dreadful thing
hetty heart is not broken of course she cried and all that but there is no disgrace upon her she can live like perdita in her garden of mint and marigold
and weep over a faithless florizel said lord_henry_wotton laughing as he leaned back in his chair my dear mr_dorian_gray you have the most curiously boyish moods
do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank i suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman
well the fact of having met you and loved you will teach her to despise her husband and she will be wretched
from a moral point of view i cannot say that i think much of your great renunciation even as a beginning it is poor
besides how do you know that hetty isnt floating at the present moment in some starlit mill pond with lovely water lilies round her like ophelia
i cant bear this harry you mock at everything and then suggest the most serious tragedies i am sorry i told you now
as i rode past the farm this morning i saw her white face at the window like a spray of jasmine
dont let us talk about it any more and dont try to persuade me that the first good action i have done for year the first little bit of self sacrifice i have ever known is really a sort of sin
i dont care what you say to me i know i was right in acting as i did poor hetty i want to be better
i am going to be better tell me something about yourself what is going on in town i have not been to the club for day
i should have thought they had got tired of that by this time said mr_dorian_gray pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly
my dear boy they have only been talking about it for six weeks and the british public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months
the people are still discussing poor basil_hallward disappearance they have been very fortunate lately however they have had my own divorce case and alan_campbell suicide
scotland yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for paris by the midnight train on the ninth of november was poor basil_hallward and the french police declare that basil_hallward never arrived in paris at all
now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist i suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in san francisco
it is an odd thing but every one who disappears is said to be seen at san francisco it must be a delightful city and possess all the attractions of the next world
what do you think has happened to basil_hallward asked mr_dorian_gray holding up his burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could discuss the matter so calmly
i have not the slightest idea if basil_hallward chooses to hide himself it is no business of mine
if he is dead i dont want to think about him death is the only thing that ever terrifies me i hate it
because said lord_henry_wotton passing beneath his nostrils the gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box one can survive everything nowadays except that
why said the younger man wearily death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away
let us have our coffee in the music room mr_dorian_gray you must play chopin to me the man with whom my wife ran away played chopin exquisitely
poor victoria i was very fond of her the house is rather lonely without her of course married life is merely a habit a bad habit
but then one regrets the loss even of one worst habits perhaps one regrets them the most they are such an essential part of one personality
mr_dorian_gray said nothing but rose from the table and passing into the next room sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys
after the coffee had been brought in he stopped and looking over at lord_henry_wotton said harry did it ever occur to you that basil_hallward was murdered
lord_henry_wotton yawned basil_hallward was very popular and always wore a waterbury watch why should he have been murdered
he was not clever enough to have enemies of course he had a wonderful genius for painting but a man can paint like velasquez and yet be as dull as possible
he only interested me once and that was when he told me year ago that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art
basil_hallward was really rather dull i was very fond of basil_hallward said mr_dorian_gray with a note of sadness in his voice
but dont people say that he was murdered oh some of the papers do it does not seem to me to be at all probable
i know there are dreadful place in paris but basil_hallward was not the sort of man to have gone to them
he had no curiosity it was his chief defect what would you say harry if i told you that i had murdered basil_hallward
said the younger man he watched him intently after he had spoken i would say my dear fellow that you were posing for a character that doesnt suit you
all crime is vulgar just as all vulgarity is crime it is not in you mr_dorian_gray to commit a murder i am sorry if i hurt your vanity by saying so but i assure you it is true
crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders i dont blame them in the smallest degree i should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations
a method of procuring sensations do you think then that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again
dont tell me that oh anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often cried lord_henry_wotton laughing
that is one of the most important secret of life i should fancy however that murder is always a mistake one should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner
i wish i could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest but i cant
but let us pass from poor basil_hallward i dare say he fell into the seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal
i see him lying now on his back under those dull green waters with the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair
yes i should fancy that was his end do you know i dont think he would have done much more good work
mr_dorian_gray heaved a sigh and lord_henry_wotton strolled across the room and began to stroke the head of a curious java parrot a large grey plumaged bird with pink crest and tail that was balancing itself upon a bamboo perch
as his pointed fingers touched it it dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black glasslike eye and began to sway backwards and forwards
during the last ten year his painting had gone off very much yes he continued turning round and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket his painting had quite gone off
it seemed to me to have lost something it had lost an ideal when you and he ceased to be great friend he ceased to be a great artist
what was it separated you i suppose he bored you if so he never forgave you it a habit bores have
by the way what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you i dont think i have ever seen it since he finished it
i remember your telling me year ago that you had sent it down to selby and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way
oh you never got it back what a pity it was really a masterpiece i remember i wanted to buy it
since then his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative british artist
i wish i had now it belonged to basil_hallward best period did you advertise for it you should i forget said mr_dorian_gray
i suppose i did but i never really liked it i am sorry i sat for it the memory of the thing is hateful to me
why do you talk of it it used to remind me of those curious lines in some play hamlet i think how do they run like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart
yes that is what it was like lord_henry_wotton laughed if a man treats life artistically his brain is his heart he answered sinking into an arm chair
mr_dorian_gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano like the painting of a sorrow he repeated a face without a heart
by the way mr_dorian_gray he said after a pause what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose how does the quotation run his own soul
the elder man lay back and looked at him with half closed eye the music jarred and mr_dorian_gray started and stared at his friend
my dear fellow said lord_henry_wotton elevating his eyebrows in surprise i asked you because i thought you might be able to give me an answer
why do you ask me that harry that is all i was going through the park last sunday and close by the marble arch
there stood a little crowd of shabby looking people listening to some vulgar street preacher as i passed by i heard the man yelling out that question to his audience
a wet sunday an uncouth christian in a mackintosh a ring of sickly white face under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lip it was really very good in its way quite a suggestion
it struck me as being rather dramatic london is very rich in curious effects of that kind i thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul but that man had not
i am afraid however he would not have understood me dont harry the soul is a terrible reality it can be bought and sold and bartered away
it can be poisoned or made perfect there is a soul in each one of us i know it do you feel quite sure of that mr_dorian_gray
quite sure ah then it must be an illusion the thing one feels absolutely certain about are never true
that is the fatality of faith and the lesson of romance how grave you are dont be so serious what have you or i to do with the superstitions of our age
play me a nocturne mr_dorian_gray and as you play tell me in a low voice how you have kept your youth
no we have given up our belief in the soul play me something you must have some secret i am only ten year older than you are and i am wrinkled and worn and yellow
you are really wonderful mr_dorian_gray you have never looked more charming than you do to night you remind me of the day i saw you first
you were rather cheeky very shy and absolutely extraordinary you have changed of course but not in appearance i wish you would tell me your secret
to get back my youth i would do anything in the world except take exercise get up early or be respectable
youth there is nothing like it it absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth the only people to whose opinions i listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself
they seem in front of me life has revealed to them her latest wonder as for the aged i always contradict the aged
if you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday they solemnly give you the opinions current in when people wore high stocks believed in everything and knew absolutely nothing
i wonder did chopin write it at majorca with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes
i do it on principle how lovely that thing you are playing is it is marvellously romantic what a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative
dont stop i want music to night it seems to me that you are the young apollo and that i am marsyas listening to you
i have sorrows mr_dorian_gray of my own that even you know nothing of the tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young
i am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity ah mr_dorian_gray how happy you are what an exquisite life you have had
you have drunk deeply of everything you have crushed the grapes against your palate nothing has been hidden from you and it has all been to you no more than the sound of music
it has not marred you you are still the same i am not the same harry yes you are the same
i wonder what the rest of your life will be dont spoil it by renunciations at present you are a perfect type
dont make yourself incomplete you are quite flawless now you need not shake your head you know you are besides mr_dorian_gray dont deceive yourself
life is a question of nerves and fibres and slowly built up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams
but a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play i tell you mr_dorian_gray that it is on thing like these that our life depend
life is not governed by will or intention you may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong browning writes about that somewhere but our own sense will imagine them for us
there are moment when the odour of lilas blanc passes suddenly across me and i have to live the strangest month of my life over again
i wish i could change place with you mr_dorian_gray the world has cried out against us both but it has always worshipped you
it always will worship you you are the type of what the age is searching for and what it is afraid it has found
i am so glad that you have never done anything never carved a statue or painted a picture or produced anything outside of yourself
life has been your art you have set yourself to music your day are your sonnets mr_dorian_gray rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair
yes life has been exquisite he murmured but i am not going to have the same life harry and you must not say these extravagant thing to me
you dont know everything about me i think that if you did even you would turn from me you laugh dont laugh
why have you stopped playing mr_dorian_gray go back and give me the nocturne over again look at that great honey coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air
she is waiting for you to charm her and if you play she will come closer to the earth you wont
let us go to the club then it has been a charming evening and we must end it charmingly there is some one at white who wants immensely to know you young lord poole bournemouth eldest son
he has already copied your neckties and has begged me to introduce him to you he is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you
i hope not said mr_dorian_gray with a sad look in his eye but i am tired to night harry i shant go to the club
it is nearly eleven and i want to go to bed early do stay you have never played so well as to night
there was something in your touch that was wonderful it had more expression than i had ever heard from it before
it is because i am going to be good he answered smiling i am a little changed already
you cannot change to me mr_dorian_gray said lord_henry_wotton you and i will always be friend yet you poisoned me with a book once
i should not forgive that harry promise me that you will never lend that book to any one it does harm
you will soon be going about like the converted and the revivalist warning people against all the sin of which you have grown tired
my dear boy you are really beginning to moralize you are much too delightful to do that besides it is no use
you and i are what we are and will be what we will be as for being poisoned by a book there is no such thing as that
art has no influence upon action it annihilates the desire to act it is superbly sterile the book that the world calls immoral are book that show the world its own shame
that is all but we wont discuss literature come round to morrow i am going to ride at eleven we might go together and i will take you to lunch afterwards with lady branksome
she is a charming woman and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying mind you come

i thought you would be her clever tongue gets on one nerves well in any case be here at eleven must i really come harry
certainly the park is quite lovely now i dont think there have been such lilacs since the year i met you
very well i shall be here at eleven said mr_dorian_gray good night harry as he reached the door he hesitated for a moment as if he had something more to say
it was a lovely night so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and did not even put his silk scarf
then he sighed and went out chapter round his throat as he strolled home smoking his cigarette two young man in evening dress passed him
he heard one of them whisper to the other that is mr_dorian_gray he remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out or stared at or talked about
half the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was
he had often told the girl whom he had lured to love him that he was poor and she had believed him
he had told her once that he was wicked and she had laughed at him and answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly
he was tired of hearing his own name now what a laugh she had just like a thrush singing and how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large hats
she knew nothing but she had everything that he had lost when he reached home he found his servant waiting up for him
he sent him to bed and threw himself down on the sofa in the library and began to think over some of the thing that lord_henry_wotton had said to him
he felt a wild longing for the unstained purity of his boyhood his rose white boyhood as lord_henry_wotton had once called it
he knew that he had tarnished himself filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy that he had been an evil influence to others and had experienced a terrible joy in being so and that of the life that had crossed his own it had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame
was it really true that one could never change but was it all irretrievable was there no hope for him ah
in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that the portrait should bear the burden of his day and he keep the unsullied splendour of eternal youth
all his failure had been due to that better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure swift penalty along with it
not forgive us our sin but smite us for our iniquities should be the prayer of man to a most just god
the curiously carved mirror that lord_henry_wotton had given to him so many year ago now was standing on the table and the white limbed cupids laughed round it as of old
he took it up as he had done on that night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture and with wild tear dimmed eye looked into its polished shield
there was purification in punishment once some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter ending with these idolatrous word
the world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold the curves of your lip rewrite history the phrases came back to his memory and he repeated them over and over to himself
then he loathed his own beauty and flinging the mirror on the floor crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel
it was his beauty that had ruined him his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for but for those two thing his life might have been free from stain
his beauty had been to him but a mask his youth but a mockery what was youth at best a green an unripe time a time of shallow moods and sickly thoughts
why had he worn its livery youth had spoiled him it was better not to think of the past nothing could alter that
it was of himself and of his own future that he had to think james_vane was hidden in a nameless grave in selby churchyard
alan_campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to know
the excitement such as it was over basil_hallward disappearance would soon pass away it was already waning he was perfectly safe there
nor indeed was it the death of basil_hallward that weighed most upon his mind it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him
basil_hallward had painted the portrait that had marred his life he could not forgive him that it was the portrait that had done everything
basil_hallward had said thing to him that were unbearable and that he had yet borne with patience the murder had been simply the madness of a moment
as for alan_campbell his suicide had been his own act he had chosen to do it it was nothing to him
a new life that was what he wanted that was what he was waiting for surely he had begun it already
he had spared one innocent thing at any rate he would never again tempt innocence he would be good as he thought of hetty merton he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed
surely it was not still so horrible as it had been perhaps if his life became pure he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face
perhaps the signs of evil had already gone away he would go and look he took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs
as he unbarred the door a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young looking face and lingered for a moment about his lip
yes he would be good and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him
he went in quietly locking the door behind him as was his custom and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait
he felt as if the load had been lifted from him already a cry of pain and indignation broke from him
he could see no change save that in the eye there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite
the thing was still loathsome more loathsome if possible than before and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter and more like blood newly spilled
then he trembled had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed or the desire for a new sensation as lord_henry_wotton had hinted with his mocking laugh
or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do thing finer than we are ourselves or perhaps all these
and why was the red stain larger than it had been it seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers
there was blood on the painted foot as though the thing had dripped blood even on the hand that had not held the knife
confess did it mean that he was to confess to give himself up and be put to death he laughed he felt that the idea was monstrous
besides even if he did confess who would believe him there was no trace of the murdered man anywhere everything belonging to him had been destroyed
he himself had burned what had been below stairs the world would simply say that he was mad they would shut him up if he persisted in his story
yet it was his duty to confess to suffer public shame and to make public atonement there was a god who called upon man to tell their sin to earth as well as to heaven
nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin his sin he shrugged his shoulders
the death of basil_hallward seemed very little to him he was thinking of hetty merton for it was an unjust mirror this mirror of his soul that he was looking at
vanity curiosity hypocrisy had there been nothing more in his renunciation than that there had been something more at least he thought so
but who could tell no there had been nothing more through vanity he had spared her in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness
for curiosity sake he had tried the denial of self he recognized that now but this murder was it to dog him all his life
was he always to be burdened by his past was he really to confess never there was only one bit of evidence left against him
the picture itself that was evidence he would destroy it why had he kept it so long once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old
of late he had felt no such pleasure it had kept him awake at night when he had been away he had been filled with terror lest other eye should look upon it
it had brought melancholy across his passion its mere memory had marred many moment of joy it had been like conscience to him
yes it had been conscience he would destroy it he looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed basil_hallward
he had cleaned it many time till there was no stain left upon it it was bright and glistened as it had killed the painter so it would kill the painter work and all that that meant
it would kill the past and when that was dead he would be free it would kill this monstrous soul life and without its hideous warnings he would be at peace
he seized the thing and stabbed the picture with it there was a cry heard and a crash the cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their room
two gentlemen who were passing in the square below stopped and looked up at the great house they walked on till they met a policeman and brought him back
the man rang the bell several time but there was no answer except for a light in one of the top window the house was all dark
after a time he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched whose house is that constable asked the elder of the two gentlemen
mr_dorian_gray sir answered the policeman they looked at each other as they walked away and sneered one of them was sir henry ashton uncle
inside in the servants part of the house the half clad domestics were talking in low whispers to each other old mrs leaf was crying and wringing her hand
francis was as pale as death after about a quarter of an hour he got the coachman and one of the footmen and crept upstairs
they knocked but there was no reply they called out everything was still finally after vainly trying to force the door they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony
when they entered they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty
the window yielded easily their bolts were old lying on the floor was a dead man in evening dress with a knife in his heart
he was withered wrinkled and loathsome of visage it was not till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was
