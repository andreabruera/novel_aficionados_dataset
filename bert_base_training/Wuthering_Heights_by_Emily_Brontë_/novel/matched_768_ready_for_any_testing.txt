language english ccx pglaf org wuthering heights chapter i i have just returned from a visit to my landlord the solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with
in all england i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society
this is certainly a beautiful country a perfect misanthropist heaven and mr_heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us
he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eye withdraw so suspiciously under their brow as i rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still further in his waistcoat as i announced my name
i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross_grange
a capital fellow mr_heathcliff i said a nod was the answer mr_lockwood your new tenant sir i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts
thrushcross_grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing i should not allow any one to inconvenience me if i could hinder it walk in
the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the word and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself
when he saw my horse breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court joseph take mr_lockwood horse and bring up some wine
here we have the whole establishment of domestics i suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order no wonder the grass grows up between the flags and cattle are the only hedge cutters
he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent
joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy the lord help us wuthering heights is the name of mr_heathcliff dwelling
pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all time indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun
happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow window are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones
before passing the threshold i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys i detected the date and the name hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw
i would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium
one stop brought us into the family sitting room without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house pre eminently
it includes kitchen and parlour generally but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and i observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls
one end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof
the latter had never been under drawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it
above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of horse pistols and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge
the floor was of smooth white stone the chairs high backed primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade
in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge liver coloured bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses
the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters
such an individual seated in his arm chair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six mile among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner
wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather but mr_heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living
he is a dark skinned gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose
tells me it is nothing of the sort i know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling to manifestations of mutual kindliness
possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of under bred pride i have a sympathetic chord within that he ll love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again
mr_heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reason for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would be acquaintance to those which actuate me
no i running on too fast i bestow my own attributes over liberally on him let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar
my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one
while enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eye as long as she took no notice of me
i never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a return the sweetest of all imaginable looks
i confess it with shame shrunk icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and farther till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp
and what did i do by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved i alone can appreciate
i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch
you better let the dog alone growled mr_heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot
my caress provoked a long guttural gnarl she not accustomed to be spoiled not kept for a pet then striding to a side door he shouted again joseph
joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me vis a vis the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep dogs who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements
not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees
this proceeding aroused the whole hive half a dozen four footed fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre
i felt my heels and coat laps peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in re establishing peace
mr_heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i dont think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping
happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch a lusty dame with tucked up gown bare arms and fire flushed cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying pan and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene
i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us what the devil is the matter he asked eyeing me in a manner that i could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment
what the devil indeed i muttered the herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours sir
they wont meddle with persons who touch nothing he remarked putting the bottle before me and restoring the displaced table
you might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers the dogs do right to be vigilant take a glass of wine
no thank you not bitten are you if i had been i would have set my signet on the biter
mr_heathcliff countenance relaxed into a grin come come he said you are flurried mr_lockwood here take a little wine
guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that i and my dogs i am willing to own hardly know how to receive them
i bowed and returned the pledge beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs besides i felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense since his humour took that turn
he probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement
i found him very intelligent on the topics we touched and before i went home i was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to morrow
your health sir he evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion i shall go notwithstanding it is astonishing how sociable i feel myself compared with him
i had half a mind to spend it by my study fire instead of wading through heath and mud to wuthering heights
on coming up from dinner however b i dine between twelve and one clock the housekeeper a matronly lady taken as a fixture along with the house could not or would not comprehend my request that i might be served at five on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention and stepping into the room i saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal scuttles and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders
this spectacle drove me back immediately i took my hat and after a four mile walk arrived at mr_heathcliff garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower
on that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost and the air made me shiver through every limb
being unable to remove the chain i jumped over and running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes knocked vainly for admittance till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled
chapter ii yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold wretched inmates i ejaculated mentally you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality
at least i would not keep my door barred in the day time i dont care i will get in so resolved i grasped the latch and shook it vehemently
vinegar faced joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn what are ye for he shoutedt maister down it fowld
go round by th end ot laith if ye went to spake to him is there nobody inside to open the door
i hallooed responsively there nobbutt missis and shoo ll not oppent an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght
why cannot you tell her whom i am eh joseph nor ne me i ll hae no hend wit muttered the head vanishing
i seized the handle to essay another trial when a young man without coat and shouldering a pitchfork appeared in the yard behind
he hailed me to follow him and after marching through a wash house and a paved area containing a coal shed pump and pigeon cot we at length arrived in the huge warm cheerful apartment where i was formerly received
it glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire compounded of coal peat and wood and near the table laid for a plentiful evening meal i was pleased to observe the missis an individual whose existence i had never previously suspected
the snow began to drive thickly i bowed and waited thinking she would bid me take a seat she looked at me leaning back in her chair and remained motionless and mute
i afraid mrs mr_heathcliff the door must bear the consequence of your servants leisure attendance i had hard work to make them hear me
i stared she stared also at any rate she kept her eye on me in a cool regardless manner exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable
rough weather i remarked she never opened her mouth sit down said the young man gruffly he ll be in soon
i obeyed and hemmed and called the villain juno who deigned at this second interview to move the extreme tip of her tail in token of owning my acquaintance
a beautiful animal i commenced again do you intend parting with the little ones madam they are not mine said the amiable hostess more repellingly than mr_heathcliff himself could have replied
ah your favourites are among these i continued turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats a strange choice of favourites
she observed scornfully unluckily it was a heap of dead rabbits i hemmed once more and drew closer to the hearth repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening
you should not have come out she said rising and reaching from the chimney piece two of the painted canisters her position before was sheltered from the light now i had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance
she was slender and apparently scarcely past girlhood an admirable form and the most exquisite little face that i have ever had the pleasure of beholding small features very fair flaxen ringlets or rather golden hanging loose on her delicate neck and eye had they been agreeable in expression that would have been irresistible fortunately for my susceptible heart the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation singularly unnatural to be detected there
the canisters were almost out of her reach i made a motion to aid her she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold
i dont want your help she snapped i can get them for myself i beg your pardon i hastened to reply
she demanded tying an apron over her neat black frock and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot
were you asked to tea i shall be glad to have a cup i answered were you asked she repeated
she flung the tea back spoon and all and resumed her chair in a pet her forehead corrugated and her red under lip pushed out like a child ready to cry
meanwhile the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment and erecting himself before the blaze looked down on me from the corner of his eye for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us
i began to doubt whether he were a servant or not his dress and speech were both rude entirely devoid of the superiority observable in mr and mrs mr_heathcliff his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks and his hand were embrowned like those of a common labourer still his bearing was free almost haughty and he showed none of a domestic assiduity in attending on the lady of the house
in the absence of clear proofs of his condition i deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct and five minutes afterwards the entrance of mr_heathcliff relieved me in some measure from my uncomfortable state
no i said half smiling you are the proper person to ask me you see sir i am come according to promise
i exclaimed assuming the cheerful and i fear i shall be weather bound for half an hour if you can afford me shelter during that space
he said shaking the white flakes from his clothes i wonder you should select the thick of a snow storm to ramble about in
people familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings and i can tell you there is no chance of a change at present
perhaps i can get a guide among your lads and he might stay at the grange till morning could you spare me one
half an hour do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes no i could not
are you going to mak the tea demanded he of the shabby coat shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady
oh indeed well then i must trust to my own sagacity umph is he to have any she asked appealing to mr_heathcliff
get it ready will you was the answer uttered so savagely that i started the tone in which the word were said revealed a genuine bad nature
i no longer felt inclined to call mr_heathcliff a capital fellow when the preparations were finished he invited me with now sir bring forward your chair
and we all including the rustic youth drew round the table an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal i thought if i had caused the cloud it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it
they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn and it was impossible however ill tempered they might be that the universal scowl they wore was their every day countenance
it is strange i began in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend mr_heathcliff yet i ll venture to say that surrounded by your family and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart
my amiable lady he interrupted with an almost diabolical sneer on his face where is she my amiable lady mrs mr_heathcliff your wife i mean
well yes oh you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights even when her body is gone
i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife
one was about forty a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining year
then it flashed upon me the clown at my elbow who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hand may be her husband mr_heathcliff junior of course
here is the consequence of being buried alive she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed
is that it perceiving myself in a blunder i attempted to correct it the other did not look seventeen a sad pity i must beware how i cause her to regret her choice
the last reflection may seem conceited it was not my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive i knew through experience that i was tolerably attractive
he turned as he spoke a peculiar look in her direction a look of hatred unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not like those of other people interpret the language of his soul
mrs mr_heathcliff is my daughter in law said mr_heathcliff corroborating my surmise ah certainly i see now you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy i remarked turning to my neighbour
but he seemed to recollect himself presently and smothered the storm in a brutal curse muttered on my behalf which however i took care not to notice
unhappy in your conjectures sir observed my host we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy her mate is dead
this was worse than before the youth grew crimson and clenched his fist with every appearance of a meditated assault i said she was my daughter in law therefore she must have married my son
mr_heathcliff smiled again as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him
and this young man is not my son assuredly my name is hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw growled the other and i counsel you to respect it
he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible
i ve shown no disrespect was my reply laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle
the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame and more than neutralised the glowing physical comforts round me and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time
the business of eating being concluded and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation i approached a window to examine the weather
a sorrowful sight i saw dark night coming down prematurely and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow
i dont think it possible for me to get home now without a guide i could not help exclaiming the roads will be buried already and if they were bare i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance
hareton_earnshaw drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch they ll be covered if left in the fold all night and put a plank before them said mr_heathcliff
there was no reply to my question and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs and mrs mr_heathcliff leaning over the fire diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney piece as she restored the tea canister to its place
the former when he had deposited his burden took a critical survey of the room and in cracked tones grated out aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i idleness un war when all on ems goan out
how must i do i continued with rising irritation bud yah re a nowt and it no use talking yah ll niver mend yer ill ways but goa raight tot divil like
i imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me and sufficiently enraged stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door
yer mother afore ye mrs mr_heathcliff however checked me by her answer you scandalous old hypocrite she replied are you not afraid of being carried away bodily whenever you mention the devil name
look here joseph she continued taking a long dark book from a shelf i ll show you how far i ve progressed in the black art
i warn you to refrain from provoking me or i ll ask your abduction as a special favour stop i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it
the red cow didnt die by chance and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations oh wicked wicked
gasped the elder may the lord deliver us from evil no reprobate you are a castaway be off or i ll hurt you seriously
i ll have you all modelled in wax and clay and the first who passes the limits i fix shall i ll not say what he shall be done to
the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eye and joseph trembling with sincere horror hurried out praying and ejaculating wicked as he went
i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun and now that we were alone i endeavoured to interest her in my distress
but you ll see go i looking at you mrs mr_heathcliff i said earnestly you must excuse me for troubling you i presume because with that face i sure you cannot help being good hearted
do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london
take the road you came she answered ensconcing herself in a chair with a candle and the long book open before her
then if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow your conscience wont whisper that it is partly your fault
it is brief advice but as sound as i can give how so i cannot escort you they wouldnt let me go to the end of the garden wall
i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried
i want you to tell me my way not to show it or else to persuade mr_heathcliff to give me a guide
you who there is himself catherine_earnshaw zillah joseph and i which would you have are there no boys at the farm
no those are all then it follows that i am compelled to stay that you may settle with your host
i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried mr_heathcliff stern voice from the kitchen entrance
as to staying here i dont keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton_earnshaw or joseph if you do i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied
a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch
i have nothing to do with it no no with this insult my patience was at an end i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against catherine_earnshaw in my haste
it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other
at first the young man appeared about to befriend me i ll go with him as far as the park he said
you ll go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore and who is to look after the horses eh
a man life is of more consequence than one evening neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs mr_heathcliff more kindly than i expected
then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr_heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply
not at your command retorted hareton_earnshaw if you set store on him you better be quiet hearken hearken shoo cursing on em
he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern
muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering maister maister he stalingt lanthern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat
on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from mr_heathcliff and hareton_earnshaw put the copestone on my rage and humiliation
fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant master pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me out on their peril to keep me one minute longer with several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear
the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still mr_heathcliff laughed and still i scolded
i dont know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer
hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar
she thought that some of them had been laying violent hand on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel
well mr catherine_earnshaw she cried i wonder what you ll have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very door stones
i see this house will never do for me look att poor lad he fair choking wisht wisht you mun nt go on so
come in and i ll cure that there now hold ye still with these word she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen
mr_heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof
he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed
while leading the way upstairs she recommended that i should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly
she did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious
chapter iii i asked the reason too stupefied to be curious myself i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed
the whole furniture consisted of a chair a clothes press and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach window
having approached this structure i looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of old fashioned couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself
i slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of mr_heathcliff and every one else
the ledge where i placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint
this writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and small catherine_earnshaw here and there varied to catherine_earnshaw mr_heathcliff and then again to catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff
in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window and continued spelling over catherine_earnshaw mr_heathcliff mrs_linton_heathcliff till my eye closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as spectres the air swarmed with catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name i discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf skin
i snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee
it was a testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a fly leaf bore the inscription catherine_earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back
in fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table i shut it and took up another and another till i had examined all
catherine_earnshaw library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen and ink commentary at least the appearance of one covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left
at the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend joseph rudely yet powerfully sketched
some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine_earnshaw and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics
an awful sunday commenced the paragraph beneath i wish my father were back again mr_hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to mr_heathcliff is atrocious
all day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while mr_hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire doing anything but reading their bibles i ll answer for it mr_heathcliff myself and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake
the service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending what done already
on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners
and i are going to rebel we took our initiatory step this evening a vain idea you forget you have a master here says the tyrant
i ll demolish the first who puts me out of temper i insist on perfect sobriety and silence oh boy was that you
frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her husband knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the hour foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of
frances darling pull his hair as you go by i heard him snap his fingers we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser
i had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes joseph on an errand from the stables
he tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croakst maister nobbut just buried and sabbath not ered undt sound ot gospel
still i yer lugs and ye darr be laiking shame on ye sit ye down ill childer there good books eneugh if ye ll read em
saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the far off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon us
sit ye down and think yer sowls i could not bear the employment i took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing i hated a good book
mr_heathcliff kicked his to the same place then there was a hubbub maister mr_hindley shouted our chaplain maister coom hither
miss_cathy riven th back off th helmet salvation un mr_heathcliff pawsed his fit intot first part ot brooad way to destruction
it fair flaysome that ye let em go on this gait ech th owd man wad ha laced em properly but he goan
mr_hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where joseph asseverated owd nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent
i reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter
a pleasant suggestion and then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy verified we cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here
i suppose catherine_earnshaw fulfilled her project for the next sentence took up another subject she waxed lachrymose
how little did i dream that mr_hindley would ever make me cry so she wrote my head aches till i cannot keep it on the pillow and still i cant give over
mr_hindley calls him a vagabond and wont let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and i must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders
poor mr_heathcliff he has been blaming our father how dared he for treating too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place
i began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print
i saw a red ornamented title seventy time seven and the first of the seventy first a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabez branderham in the chapel of gimmerden sough
and while i was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what jabez branderham would make of his subject i sank back in bed and fell asleep
alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night
i dont remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering i began to dream almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality
the snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a pilgrim staff telling me that i could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a heavy headed cudgel which i understood to be so denominated
for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence
i thought it was morning and i had set out on my way home with joseph for a guide then a new idea flashed across me
i was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous jabez branderham preach from the text seventy time seven and either joseph the preacher or
i had committed the first of the seventy first and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated we came to the chapel
i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there
the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the clergyman stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets
what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin
however in my dream jabez had a full and attentive congregation and he preached good god where he searched for them i cannot tell
he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion
they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously oh how weary i grow how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived
how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eye and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done
at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabez branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon
sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety head of your discourse
i was condemned to hear all out finally he reached the first of the seventy first seventy time seven time have i plucked up my hat and been about to depart seventy time seven time
have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat the four hundred and ninety first is too much fellow martyrs have at him
drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more thou art the man
cried jabez after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion seventy time seven time didst thou gapingly contort thy visage
seventy time seven did i take counsel with my soul lo this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the seventy first is come
with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their pilgrim staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in self defence commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his
brethren execute upon him the judgment written such honour have all his saints in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces
presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings every man hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me
merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes
i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before
this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved to silence it if possible and
and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played jabez part in the row i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement
the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless
i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little ice cold hand
the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me in let me in
who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff it replied shiveringly why did i think of mrs_linton_heathcliff
i had read catherine_earnshaw twenty time for mrs_linton_heathcliff i come home i lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a child face looking through the window
terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in
and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in
the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer
i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on
begone i shouted i ll never let you in not if you beg for twenty year it is twenty year mourned the voice twenty year
i ve been a waif for twenty year thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward
to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed
i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself
i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew mr_heathcliff accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet
at last he said in a half whisper plainly not expecting an answer is any one here with this intention i turned and opened the panels
mr_heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him
the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up
it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further
i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare
i sorry i disturbed you oh god confound you mr_lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady
and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions
who was it i ve a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments
i should not care if you did mr_heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense
well it is swarming with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den
lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for heaven sake dont repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut
what do you mean asked mr_heathcliff and what are you doing if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me
i returned i not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabez branderham akin to you on the mother side
she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty year a just punishment for her mortal transgressions i ve no doubt
scarcely were these word uttered when i recollected the association of mr_heathcliff with catherine_earnshaw name in the book which had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened
i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to add the truth is sir i passed the first part of the night
and that minx catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff or catherine_earnshaw or however she was called she must have been a changeling wicked little soul in here i stopped afresh
i was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself
i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that window ledge a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or
what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered mr_heathcliff with savage vehemence how how dare you under my roof god
i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control
he mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage mr_heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it
not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looked at my watch and soliloquised on the length of the night not three clock yet
i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion i could have taken oath it had been six
always at nine in winter and rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arm shadow dashing a tear from his eye mr_lockwood he added you may go into my room you ll only be in the way coming down stairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me
i ll walk in the yard till daylight and then i ll be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion
time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight and for me too i replied i now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town
a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself delightful company muttered mr_heathcliff take the candle and go where you please
keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the house juno mounts sentinel there and nay you can only ramble about the steps and passages
i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense
he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears
i shall join you directly but away with you i ll come in two minutes come in come in he sobbed
the spectre showed a spectre ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light
there was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension
i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle
miss_cathy do come oh do once more oh my heart darling hear me this time catherine_earnshaw at last nothing was stirring except a brindled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew
two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other
any one invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap
he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a three inch pipe with tobacco
my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away
i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came
a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw was performing his orison sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts
he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat
we were both of us nodding ere the ascent to his garret i suppose i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him
he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality
it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs mr_heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze
she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eye and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face
he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene with poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan
and you you worthless he broke out as i entered turning to his daughter in law and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash
i was surprised to see mr_heathcliff there also there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their bread you live on my charity
you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight do you hear damnable jade i ll put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse
put your trash away and find something to do answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair
but i ll not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please mr_heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight
having no desire to be entertained by a cat and dog combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute
each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities mr_heathcliff placed his fists out of temptation in his pockets mrs mr_heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay
i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice
that was not long my landlord halloed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor
it was well he did for the whole hill back was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my yesterday walk left pictured in my mind
i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road
our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the porter lodge is untenanted as yet
the distance from the gate to the grange is two mile i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow
we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate
at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights
my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains
now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged up stairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment
i who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse and thanked my stars that at length i had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable i weak wretch after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude was finally compelled to strike my colours and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment i desired mrs ellen_dean when she brought in supper to sit down while i ate it hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk
i bid them be quiet chapter iv what vain weathercocks we are you have lived here a considerable time i commenced did you not say sixteen year
eighteen sir i came when the mistress was married to wait on her after she died the master retained me for his housekeeper
indeed there ensued a pause she was not a gossip i feared unless about her own affairs and those could hardly interest me
however having studied for an interval with a fist on either knee and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance she ejaculated ah time are greatly changed since then
yes i remarked you ve seen a good many alterations i suppose i have and troubles too she said
and that pretty girl widow i should like to know her history whether she be a native of the country or as is more probable an exotic that the surly indigenae will not recognise for kin
with this intention i asked mrs ellen_dean why mr_heathcliff let thrushcross_grange and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior
oh i ll turn the talk on my landlord family i thought to myself a good subject to start is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order
yes yes he rich enough to live in a finer house than this but he very near close handed and if he had meant to flit to thrushcross_grange as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more
i inquired rich sir she returned he has nobody knows what money and every year it increases it is strange people should be so greedy when they are alone in the world
he had a son it seems yes he had one he is dead and that young lady mrs mr_heathcliff is his widow
yes where did she come from originally why sir she is my late master daughter catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff was her maiden name
i nursed her poor thing i did wish mr_heathcliff would remove here and then we might have been together again
what catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff i exclaimed astonished but a minute reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly catherine_earnshaw then i continued my predecessor name was mrs_linton_heathcliff
it was and who is that catherine_earnshaw hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw who lives with mr_heathcliff are they relations no he is the late mrs_linton_heathcliff nephew
the young lady cousin then yes and her husband was her cousin also one on the mother the other on the father side
are they an old family very old sir and hareton_earnshaw is the last of them as our miss_cathy is of us i mean of the lintons
mr_heathcliff married mr mrs_linton_heathcliff sister i see the house at wuthering heights has catherine_earnshaw carved over the front door have you been to wuthering heights
i beg pardon for asking but i should like to hear how she is mrs mr_heathcliff she looked very well and very handsome yet i think not very happy
oh dear i dont wonder and how did you like the master a rough fellow rather mrs ellen_dean is not that his character
rough as a saw edge and hard as whinstone the less you meddle with him the better he must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl
it a cuckoo sir i know all about it except where he was born and who were his parents and how he got his money at first
the unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated
do you know anything of his history and hareton_earnshaw has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock well mrs ellen_dean it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours
i feel i shall not rest if i go to bed so be good enough to sit and chat an hour
oh certainly sir i ll just fetch a little sewing and then i ll sit as long as you please but you ve caught cold
the worthy woman bustled off and i crouched nearer the fire my head felt hot and the rest of me chill moreover i was excited almost to a pitch of foolishness through my nerves and brain
this caused me to feel not uncomfortable but rather fearful as i am still of serious effects from the incidents of to day and yesterday
she returned presently bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work and having placed the former on the hob drew in her seat evidently pleased to find me so companionable
i saw you shivering and you must have some gruel to drive it out before i came to live here she commenced waiting no farther invitation to her story
i was almost always at wuthering heights because my mother had nursed mr_hindley catherine_earnshaw that was hareton_earnshaw father and i got used to playing with the child i ran errands too and helped to make hay and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to
catherine_earnshaw the old master came down stairs dressed for a journey and after he had told joseph what was to be done during the day he turned to mr_hindley and miss_cathy and me for i sat eating my porridge with them and he said speaking to his son now my bonny man i going to liverpool to day what shall i bring you
you may choose what you like only let it be little for i shall walk there and back sixty mile each way that is a long spell
mr_hindley named a fiddle and then he asked miss_cathy she was hardly six year old but she could ride any horse in the stable and she chose a whip
one fine summer morning it was the beginning of harvest i remember mr he did not forget me for he had a kind heart though he was rather severe sometimes
he promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears and then he kissed his child said good bye and set off
it seemed a long while to us all the three days of his absence and often did little miss_cathy ask when he would be home
mrs catherine_earnshaw expected him by supper time on the third evening and she put the meal off hour after hour there were no signs of his coming however and at last the child got tired of running down to the gate to look
then it grew dark she would have had them to bed but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up and just about eleven clock the door latch was raised quietly and in stepped the master
he threw himself into a chair laughing and groaning and bid them all stand off for he was nearly killed he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms
and at the end of it to be flighted to death he said opening his great coat which he held bundled up in his arms
you must en take it as a gift of god though it as dark almost as if it came from the devil
we crowded round and over miss_cathy head i had a peep at a dirty ragged black haired child big enough both to walk and talk indeed its face looked older than catherine_earnshaw yet when it was set on its feet it only stared round and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand
i was frightened and mrs catherine_earnshaw was ready to fling it out of door she did fly up asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for
see here wife i was never so beaten with anything in my life but what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad
the master tried to explain the matter but he was really half dead with fatigue and all that i could make out amongst her scolding was a tale of his seeing it starving and houseless and as good as dumb in the streets of liverpool where he picked it up and inquired for its owner
not a soul knew to whom it belonged he said and his money and time being both limited he thought it better to take it home with him at once than run into vain expenses there because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it
well the conclusion was that my mistress grumbled herself calm and mr catherine_earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean things and let it sleep with the child
mr_hindley and miss_cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored then both began searching their father pockets for the presents he had promised them
the former was a boy of fourteen but when he drew out what had been a fiddle crushed to morsels in the great coat he blubbered aloud and miss_cathy when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing earning for her pains a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners
they entirely refused to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sense so i put it on the landing of the stairs hoping it might be gone on the morrow
by chance or else attracted by hearing his voice it crept to mr catherine_earnshaw door and there he found it on quitting his chamber
inquiries were made as to how it got there i was obliged to confess and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house
on coming back a few days afterwards for i did not consider my banishment perpetual i found they had christened him mr_heathcliff it was the name of a son who died in childhood and it has served him ever since both for christian and surname
miss_cathy and he were now very thick but mr_hindley hated him and to say the truth i did the same and we plagued and went on with him shamefully for i wasnt reasonable enough to feel my injustice and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged
he seemed a sullen patient child hardened perhaps to ill treatment he would stand mr_hindley blows without winking or shedding a tear and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eye as if he had hurt himself by accident and nobody was to blame
this was mr_heathcliff first introduction to the family this endurance made old catherine_earnshaw furious when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child as he called him
he took to mr_heathcliff strangely believing all he said for that matter he said precious little and generally the truth and petting him up far above miss_cathy who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite
so from the very beginning he bred bad feeling in the house and at mrs catherine_earnshaw death which happened in less than two year after the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend and mr_heathcliff as a usurper of his parent affections and his privileges and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries
i sympathised a while but when the child fell ill of the measles and i had to tend them and take on me the cares of a woman at once i changed my idea
mr_heathcliff was dangerously sick and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow i suppose he felt i did a good deal for him and he hadnt wit to guess that i was compelled to do it
however i will say this he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over the difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial
miss_cathy and her brother harassed me terribly he was as uncomplaining as a lamb though hardness not gentleness made him give little trouble
he got through and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me and praised me for my care
i was vain of his commendations and softened towards the being by whose means i earned them and thus mr_hindley lost his last ally
still i couldnt dote on mr_heathcliff and i wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy who never to my recollection repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude
he was not insolent to his benefactor he was simply insensible though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes
as an instance i remember mr catherine_earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair and gave the lads each one
mr_heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discovered it he said to mr_hindley you must exchange horses with me i dont like mine and if you wont i shall tell your father of the three thrashings you ve given me this week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder
you better do it at once he persisted escaping to the porch they were in the stable you will have to and if i speak of these blows you ll get them again with interest
mr_hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him over the ears off dog cried mr_hindley threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay
throw it he replied standing still and then i ll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of door as soon as he died and see whether he will not turn you out directly
mr_hindley threw it hitting him on the breast and down he fell but staggered up immediately breathless and white and had not i prevented it he would have gone just so to the master and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him intimating who had caused it
take my colt gipsy then said young catherine_earnshaw and i pray that he may break your neck take him and be damned you beggarly interloper
and wheedle my father out of all he has only afterwards show him what you are imp of satan and take that
mr_heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall he was passing behind it when mr_hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled ran away as fast as he could
i was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up and went on with his intention exchanging saddles and all and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned before he entered the house
i persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted
he complained so seldom indeed of such stirs as these that i really thought him not vindictive i was deceived completely as you will hear
he had been active and healthy yet his strength left him suddenly and when he was confined to the chimney corner he grew grievously irritable
i hope he ll kick out your brains chapter in the course of time mr catherine_earnshaw began to fail a nothing vexed him and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits
this was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon or domineer over his favourite he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seeming to have got into his head the notion that because he liked mr_heathcliff all hated and longed to do him an ill turn
it was a disadvantage to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humoured his partiality and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child pride and black tempers
still it became in a manner necessary twice or thrice mr_hindley manifestation of scorn while his father was near roused the old man to a fury he seized his stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it
at last our curate we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little lintons and earnshaws and farming his bit of land himself advised that the young man should be sent to college and mr catherine_earnshaw agreed though with a heavy spirit for he
said mr_hindley was nought and would never thrive as where he wandered i hoped heartily we should have peace now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed
i fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements as he would have it that it did really you know sir it was in his sinking frame
we might have got on tolerably notwithstanding but for two people miss_cathy and joseph the servant you saw him i daresay up yonder
he was and is yet most likely the wearisomest self righteous pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours
by his knack of sermonising and pious discoursing he contrived to make a great impression on mr catherine_earnshaw and the more feeble the master became the more influence he gained
he encouraged him to regard mr_hindley as a reprobate and night after night he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against mr_heathcliff and catherine_earnshaw always minding to flatter catherine_earnshaw weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter
certainly she had ways with her such as i never saw a child take up before and she put all of us past our patience fifty time and oftener in a day from the hour she came down stairs till the hour she went to bed we had not a minute security that she wouldnt be in mischief
her spirits were always at high water mark her tongue always going singing laughing and plaguing everybody who would not do the same
he was relentless in worrying him about his soul concerns and about ruling his child rigidly a wild wicked slip she was
and after all i believe she meant no harm for when once she made you cry in good earnest it seldom happened that she would not keep you company and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her
but she had the bonniest eye the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish she was much too fond of mr_heathcliff
the greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him yet she got chided more than any of us on his account
in play she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress using her hand freely and commanding her companions she did so to me but i would not bear slapping and ordering and so i let her know
now mr catherine_earnshaw did not understand jokes from his child he had always been strict and grave with them and catherine_earnshaw on her part had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime
his peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once and she defying us with her bold saucy look and her ready word turning joseph religious curses into ridicule baiting me and doing just what her father hated most showing how her pretended insolence which he thought real had more power over mr_heathcliff than his kindness how the boy would do her bidding in anything and his only when it suited his own inclination
after behaving as badly as possible all day she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night nay miss_cathy the old man would say i cannot love thee thou rt worse than thy brother
go say thy prayers child and ask god pardon i doubt thy mother and i must rue that we ever reared thee
that made her cry at first and then being repulsed continually hardened her and she laughed if i told her to say she was sorry for her faults and beg to be forgiven
but the hour came at last that ended mr catherine_earnshaw troubles on earth he died quietly in his chair one october evening seated by the fire side
a high wind blustered round the house and roared in the chimney it sounded wild and stormy yet it was not cold and we were all together
i a little removed from the hearth busy at my knitting and joseph reading his bible near the table for the servants generally sat in the house then after their work was done
miss_cathy had been sick and that made her still she leant against her father knee and mr_heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap
i remember the master before he fell into a doze stroking her bonny hair it pleased him rarely to see her gentle and saying why canst thou not always be a good lass miss_cathy
and she turned her face up to his and laughed and answered why cannot you always be a good man father
but as soon as she saw him vexed again she kissed his hand and said she would sing him to sleep
she began singing very low till his fingers dropped from hers and his head sank on his breast then i told her to hush and not stir for fear she should wake him
we all kept as mute as mice a full half hour and should have done so longer only joseph having finished his chapter got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed
he stepped forward and called him by name and touched his shoulder but he would not move so he took the candle and looked at him
i thought there was something wrong as he set down the light and seizing the child each by an arm whispered them to frame up stairs and make little din they might pray alone that evening he had summut to do
i shall bid father good night first said catherine_earnshaw putting her arms round his neck before we could hinder her the poor thing discovered her loss directly she screamed out oh
i joined my wail to theirs loud and bitter but joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven
he dead mr_heathcliff he dead and they both set up a heart breaking cry he told me to put on my cloak and run to gimmerton_kirk for the doctor and the parson
however i went through wind and rain and brought one the doctor back with me the other said he would come in the morning
i could not guess the use that either would be of then leaving joseph to explain matters i ran to the child room
i saw they had never lain down though it was past midnight but they were calmer and did not need me to console them
the little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than i could have hit on no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did in their innocent talk and while i sobbed and listened i could not help wishing we were all there safe together
chapter vi mr_hindley came home to the funeral and a thing that amazed us and set the neighbours gossiping right and left he brought a wife with him
what she was and where she was born he never informed us probably she had neither money nor name to recommend her or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father
every object she saw the moment she crossed the threshold appeared to delight her and every circumstance that took place about her except the preparing for the burial and the presence of the mourners
i thought she was half silly from her behaviour while that went on she ran into her chamber and made me come with her though i should have been dressing the child and there she sat shivering and clasping her hand and asking repeatedly are they gone yet
then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black and started and trembled and at last fell a weeping and when i asked what was the matter answered she didnt know but she felt so afraid of dying
their door was ajar she was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account i imagined her as little likely to die as myself
she was rather thin but young and fresh complexioned and her eye sparkled as bright as diamonds i did remark to be sure
that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes but i knew nothing of what these symptoms portended and had no impulse to sympathise with her
we dont in general take to foreigners here mr_lockwood unless they take to us first young catherine_earnshaw was altered considerably in the three year of his absence
he had grown sparer and lost his colour and spoke and dressed quite differently and on the very day of his return he told joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back kitchen and leave the house for him
indeed he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace at the pewter dishes and delf case and dog kennel and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort and so dropped the intention
she expressed pleasure too at finding a sister among her new acquaintance and she prattled to catherine_earnshaw and kissed her and ran about with her and gave her quantities of presents at the beginning
a few word from her evincing a dislike to mr_heathcliff were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy
he drove him from their company to the servants deprived him of the instructions of the curate and insisted that he should labour out of door instead compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm
mr_heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first because miss_cathy taught him what she learnt and worked or played with him in the fields
they both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved and what they did so they kept clear of him
he would not even have seen after their going to church on sundays only joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves and that reminded him to order mr_heathcliff a flogging and catherine_earnshaw a fast from dinner or supper
but it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at
the curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for catherine_earnshaw to get by heart and joseph might thrash mr_heathcliff till his arm ached they forgot everything the minute they were together again at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge and many a time i ve cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily and i not daring to speak a syllable for fear of losing the small power i still retained over the unfriended creatures
one sunday evening it chanced that they were banished from the sitting room for making a noise or a light offence of the kind and when i went to call them to supper i could discover them nowhere
we searched the house above and below and the yard and stables they were invisible and at last mr_hindley in a passion told us to bolt the door and swore nobody should let them in that night
the household went to bed and i too anxious to lie down opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken though it rained determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition should they return
her affection tired very soon however and when she grew peevish mr_hindley became tyrannical in a while i distinguished steps coming up the road and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate
i threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking mr catherine_earnshaw by knocking there was mr_heathcliff by himself
it gave me a start to see him alone where is miss catherine_earnshaw i cried hurriedly no accident i hope
at thrushcross_grange he answered and i would have been there too but they had not the manners to ask me to stay
well you will catch it i said you ll never be content till you re sent about your business what in the world led you wandering to thrushcross_grange
i bid him beware of rousing the master and while he undressed and i waited to put out the candle he continued miss_cathy and i escaped from the wash house to have a ramble at liberty and getting a glimpse of the grange light
we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners while their father and mother sat eating and drinking and singing and laughing and burning their eye out before the fire
let me get off my wet clothes and i ll tell you all about it nelly_dean he replied do you think they do
or reading sermons and being catechised by their manservant and set to learn a column of scripture names if they dont answer properly probably not i responded
they are good child no doubt and dont deserve the treatment you receive for your bad conduct dont cant nelly_dean he said nonsense
we ran from the top of the heights to the park without stopping catherine_earnshaw completely beaten in the race because she was barefoot
we crept through a broken hedge groped our way up the path and planted ourselves on a flower plot under the drawing room window
you ll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to morrow the light came from thence they had not put up the shutters and the curtains were only half closed
both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement and clinging to the ledge and we saw ah
it was beautiful a splendid place carpeted with crimson and crimson covered chairs and tables and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre and shimmering with little soft tapers
old mr and mrs_linton_heathcliff were not there mr_edgar and his sisters had it entirely to themselves shouldnt they have been happy
we should have thought ourselves in heaven and now guess what your good child were doing isabella_linton i believe she is eleven
a year younger than miss_cathy lay screaming at the farther end of the room shrieking as if witches were running red hot needles into her
mr_edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently and in the middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping which from their mutual accusations we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them
to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair and each begin to cry because both after struggling to get it refused to take it
when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine_earnshaw wanted or find us by ourselves seeking entertainment in yelling and sobbing and rolling on the ground divided by the whole room
i not exchange for a thousand lives my condition here for mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff at thrushcross_grange not if i might have the privilege of flinging joseph off the highest gable and painting the house front with mr_hindley blood
the idiots that was their pleasure we laughed outright at the petted things we did despise them hush hush i interrupted
still you have not told me mr_heathcliff how catherine_earnshaw is left behind i told you we laughed he answered
the lintons heard us and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door there was silence and then a cry oh mamma mamma
we made frightful noises to terrify them still more and then we dropped off the ledge because somebody was drawing the bars and we felt we had better flee
oh papa oh mamma come here oh papa oh they really did howl out something in that way i had miss_cathy by the hand and was urging her on when all at once she fell down
run mr_heathcliff run she whispered they have let the bull dog loose and he holds me the devil had seized her ankle
nelly_dean i heard his abominable snorting she did not yell out no she would have scorned to do it if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow
i did though i vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in christendom and i got a stone and thrust it between his jaws and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat
a beast of a servant came up with a lantern at last shouting keep fast skulker keep fast he changed his note however when he saw skulker game
the dog was throttled off his huge purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver
the man took miss_cathy up she was sick not from fear i certain but from pain he carried her in i followed grumbling execrations and vengeance
skulker has caught a little girl sir he replied and there a lad here he added making a clutch at me who looks an out and outer
very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the door to the gang after all were asleep that they might murder us at their ease
what prey robert hallooed mrs_linton_heathcliff from the entrance hold your tongue you foul mouthed thief you you shall go to the gallows for this
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff sir dont lay by your gun no no robert said the old fool the rascals knew that yesterday was my rent day they thought to have me cleverly
come in i ll furnish them a reception there john fasten the chain give skulker some water jenny to beard a magistrate in his stronghold and on the sabbath too
dont be afraid it is but a boy yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once before he shows his nature in acts as well as features
he pulled me under the chandelier and mrs_linton_heathcliff placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hand in horror
where will their insolence stop oh my dear mary look here the cowardly child crept nearer also isabella_linton lisping frightful thing
put him in the cellar papa he exactly like the son of the fortune teller that stole my tame pheasant isnt he mr_edgar while they examined me miss_cathy came round she heard the last speech and laughed
mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff after an inquisitive stare collected sufficient wit to recognise her they see us at church you know though we seldom meet them elsewhere
that miss catherine_earnshaw he whispered to his mother and look how skulker has bitten her how her foot bleeds
miss catherine_earnshaw nonsense cried the dame miss catherine_earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy and yet my dear the child is in mourning surely it is and she may be lamed for life
what culpable carelessness in her brother exclaimed mr mrs_linton_heathcliff turning from me to catherine_earnshaw i ve understood from shielders that was the curate sir that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism
i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made in his journey to liverpool a little lascar or an american or spanish castaway
but who is this where did she pick up this companion oho a wicked boy at all events remarked the old lady and quite unfit for a decent house
did you notice his language mrs_linton_heathcliff i shocked that my child should have heard it i recommenced cursing dont be angry nelly_dean and so robert was ordered to take me off
i refused to go without miss_cathy he dragged me into the garden pushed the lantern into my hand assured me that mr catherine_earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour and bidding me march directly secured the door again
the curtains were still looped up at one corner and i resumed my station as spy because if catherine_earnshaw had wished to return i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments unless they let her out
mrs_linton_heathcliff took off the grey cloak of the dairy maid which we had borrowed for our excursion shaking her head and expostulating with her i suppose she was a young lady and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine
then the woman servant brought a basin of warm water and washed her feet and mr mrs_linton_heathcliff mixed a tumbler of negus and isabella_linton emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap and mr_edgar stood gaping at a distance
afterwards they dried and combed her beautiful hair and gave her a pair of enormous slippers and wheeled her to the fire and i left her as merry as she could be dividing her food between the little dog and skulker whose nose she pinched as he ate and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eye of the lintons a dim reflection from her own enchanting face
i saw they were full of stupid admiration she is so immeasurably superior to them to everybody on earth is she not nelly_dean there will more come of this business than you reckon on i answered covering him up and extinguishing the light
she sat on the sofa quietly you are incurable mr_heathcliff and mr_hindley will have to proceed to extremities see if he wont
and then mr mrs_linton_heathcliff to mend matters paid us a visit himself on the morrow and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family that he was stirred to look about him in earnest
mr_heathcliff received no flogging but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine_earnshaw should ensure a dismissal and mrs catherine_earnshaw undertook to keep her sister in law in due restraint when she returned home employing art not force with force she would have found it impossible
my word came truer than i desired the luckless adventure made catherine_earnshaw furious chapter vii miss_cathy stayed at thrushcross_grange five weeks till christmas
the mistress visited her often in the interval and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her self respect with fine clothes and flattery which she took readily so that instead of a wild hatless little savage jumping into the house and rushing to squeeze us all breathless there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hand that she might sail in
by that time her ankle was thoroughly cured and her manners much improved mr_hindley lifted her from her horse exclaiming delightedly why miss_cathy you are quite a beauty
i should scarcely have known you you look like a lady now isabella_linton mrs_linton_heathcliff is not to be compared with her is she frances
isabella_linton has not her natural advantages replied his wife but she must mind and not grow wild again here ellen_dean help miss catherine_earnshaw off with her things
i removed the habit and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock white trousers and burnished shoes and while her eye sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments
i was all flour making the christmas cake and it would not have done to give me a hug and then she looked round for mr_heathcliff
mr and mrs catherine_earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting thinking it would enable them to judge in some measure what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends
stay dear you will disarrange your curls let me untie your hat she kissed me gently mr_heathcliff was hard to discover at first
but i even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy and bid him wash himself once a week and child of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water
therefore not to mention his clothes which had seen three months service in mire and dust and his thick uncombed hair the surface of his face and hand was dismally beclouded
if he were careless and uncared for before catherine_earnshaw absence he had been ten time more so since nobody he might well skulk behind the settle on beholding
such a bright graceful damsel enter the house instead of a rough headed counterpart of himself as he expected is mr_heathcliff not here
mr_heathcliff you may come forward cried mr_hindley enjoying his discomfiture and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself
she demanded pulling off her gloves and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors you may come and wish miss catherine_earnshaw welcome like the other servants
miss_cathy catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment flew to embrace him she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second and then stopped and drawing back burst into a laugh exclaiming why how very black and cross
you look and how how funny and grim but that because i used to mr_edgar and isabella_linton mrs_linton_heathcliff well mr_heathcliff have you forgotten me
she had some reason to put the question for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance and kept him immovable
shake hand mr_heathcliff said mr catherine_earnshaw condescendingly once in a way that is permitted i shall not replied the boy finding his tongue at last i shall not stand to be laughed at
i shall not bear it and he would have broken from the circle but miss_cathy seized him again i did not mean to laugh at you she said i could not hinder myself
mr_heathcliff shake hand at least what are you sulky for it was only that you looked odd if you wash your face and brush your hair it will be all right but you are so dirty
she gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own and also at her dress which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his
you neednt have touched me he answered following her eye and snatching away his hand i shall be as dirty as i please and i like to be dirty and i will be dirty
with that he dashed headforemost out of the room amid the merriment of the master and mistress and to the serious disturbance of catherine_earnshaw who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper
after playing lady maid to the new comer and putting my cakes in the oven and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires befitting christmas eve i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols all alone regardless of joseph affirmations that he considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs
he had retired to private prayer in his chamber and mr and mrs catherine_earnshaw were engaging missy attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little lintons as an acknowledgment of their kindness
they had invited them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights and the invitation had been accepted on one condition mrs_linton_heathcliff begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy
i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices and admired the shining kitchen utensils the polished clock decked in holly the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper and above all the speckless purity of my particular care the scoured and well swept floor
i gave due inward applause to every object and then i remembered how old catherine_earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied and call me a cant lass and slip a shilling into my hand as a christmas box and from that i went on to think of his fondness for mr_heathcliff and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad situation now and from singing i changed my mind to crying
it struck me soon however there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them i got up and walked into the court to seek him
he was not far i found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable and feeding the other beasts according to custom
i said the kitchen is so comfortable and joseph is up stairs make haste and let me dress you smart before miss_cathy comes out and then you can sit together with the whole hearth to yourselves and have a long chatter till bedtime
under these circumstances i remained solitary make haste mr_heathcliff he proceeded with his task and never turned his head towards me
come are you coming i continued there a little cake for each of you nearly enough and you ll need half an hour donning
i waited five minutes but getting no answer left him catherine_earnshaw supped with her brother and sister in law joseph and i joined at an unsociable meal seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other
his cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies he managed to continue work till nine clock and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber
miss_cathy sat up late having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one but he was gone and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him and then went back
in the morning he rose early and as it was a holiday carried his ill humour on to the moors not re appearing till the family were departed for church
he hung about me for a while and having screwed up his courage exclaimed abruptly nelly_dean make me decent i going to be good
fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit high time mr_heathcliff i said you have grieved catherine_earnshaw she sorry
she ever came home i daresay it looks as if you envied her because she is more thought of than you
the notion of envying catherine_earnshaw was incomprehensible to him but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough did she say she was grieved
he inquired looking very serious she cried when i told her you were off again this morning well i cried last night he returned and i had more reason to cry than she
yes you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach said i proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves
you must go up and offer to kiss her and say you know best what to say only do it heartily and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress
and now though i have dinner to get ready i ll steal time to arrange you so that mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff shall look quite a doll beside you and that he does
you are younger and yet i ll be bound you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders you could knock him down in a twinkling dont you feel that you could
but if you be ashamed of your touchiness you must ask pardon mind when she comes in mr_heathcliff face brightened a moment then it was overcast afresh and he sighed
i wish i had light hair and a fair skin and was dressed and behaved as well and had a chance of being as rich as he will be
and cried for mamma at every turn i added and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you and sat at home all day for a shower of rain
but nelly_dean if i knocked him down twenty time that wouldnt make him less handsome or me more so oh mr_heathcliff you are showing a poor spirit
do you mark those two lines between your eye and those thick brow that instead of rising arched sink in the middle and that couple of black fiends so deeply buried who never open their window boldly but lurk glinting under them like devil spies
wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles to raise your lids frankly and change the fiends to confident innocent angels suspecting and doubting nothing and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes
dont get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its dessert and yet hates all the world as well as the kicker for what it suffers
come to the glass and i ll let you see what you should wish in other word i must wish for mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff great blue eye and even forehead he replied
a good heart will help you to a bonny face my lad i continued if you were a regular black and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly
i do and that wont help me to them and now that we ve done washing and combing and sulking tell me whether you dont think yourself rather handsome
who knows but your father was emperor of china and your mother an indian queen each of them able to buy up with one week income wuthering heights and thrushcross_grange together
i ll tell you i do you re fit for a prince in disguise and you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to england
were i in your place i would frame high notions of my birth and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer
so i chattered on and mr_heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court
he ran to the window and i to the door just in time to behold the two lintons descend from the family carriage smothered in cloaks and furs and the earnshaws dismount from their horses they often rode to church in winter
catherine_earnshaw took a hand of each of the child and brought them into the house and set them before the fire which quickly put colour into their white faces
i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour and he willingly obeyed but ill luck would have it that as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side mr_hindley opened it on the other
they met and the master irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful or perhaps eager to keep his promise to mrs_linton_heathcliff shoved him back with a sudden thrust and angrily bade joseph keep the fellow out of the room send him into the garret till dinner is over
nay sir i could not avoid answering he ll touch nothing not he and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we
he ll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit if left alone with them a minute
he shall have his share of my hand if i catch him downstairs till dark cried mr_hindley begone you vagabond
what you are attempting the coxcomb are you wait till i get hold of those elegant locks see if i wont pull them a bit longer
they are long enough already observed master mrs_linton_heathcliff peeping from the doorway i wonder they dont make his head ache
he ventured this remark without any intention to insult but mr_heathcliff violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate even then as a rival
he seized a tureen of hot apple sauce the first thing that came under his grip and dashed it full against the speaker face and neck who instantly commenced a lament that brought isabella_linton and catherine_earnshaw hurrying to the place
mr catherine_earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber where doubtless he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion for he appeared red and breathless
it like a colt mane over his eye i got the dishcloth and rather spitefully scrubbed mr_edgar nose and mouth affirming it served him right for meddling
his sister began weeping to go home and miss_cathy stood by confounded blushing for all you should not have spoken to him
he was in a bad temper and now you ve spoilt your visit and he ll be flogged i hate him to be flogged
i didnt sobbed the youth escaping from my hand and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket handkerchief
she expostulated with master mrs_linton_heathcliff i cant eat my dinner why did you speak to him mr_edgar i promised mamma that i wouldnt say one word to him and i didnt
well dont cry replied catherine_earnshaw contemptuously you re not killed dont make more mischief my brother is coming be quiet hush isabella_linton
has anybody hurt you there there child to your seats cried mr_hindley bustling in that brute of a lad has warmed me nicely
next time master mr_edgar take the law into your own fists it will give you an appetite the little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast
they were hungry after their ride and easily consoled since no real harm had befallen them mr catherine_earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls and the mistress made them merry with lively talk
i waited behind her chair and was pained to behold catherine_earnshaw with dry eye and an indifferent air commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her
an unfeeling child i thought to myself how lightly she dismisses her old playmate troubles i could not have imagined her to be so selfish
she lifted a mouthful to her lips then she set it down again her cheeks flushed and the tears gushed over them
i did not call her unfeeling long for i perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself or paying a visit to mr_heathcliff who had been locked up by the master as i discovered on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of victuals
she slipped her fork to the floor and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion in the evening we had a dance
miss_cathy begged that he might be liberated then as isabella_linton mrs_linton_heathcliff had no partner her entreaties were vain and i was appointed to supply the deficiency
we got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the gimmerton_kirk band mustering fifteen strong a trumpet a trombone clarionets bassoons french horns and a bass viol besides singers
they go the rounds of all the respectable houses and receive contributions every christmas and we esteemed it a first rate treat to hear them
after the usual carols had been sung we set them to songs and glees mrs catherine_earnshaw loved the music and so they gave us plenty
catherine_earnshaw loved it too but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps and she went up in the dark
i followed they shut the house door below never noting our absence it was so full of people she made no stay at the stairs head but mounted farther to the garret where mr_heathcliff was confined and called him
he stubbornly declined answering for a while she persevered and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards
i let the poor things converse unmolested till i supposed the songs were going to cease and the singers to get some refreshment then i clambered up the ladder to warn her
the little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret along the roof into the skylight of the other and it was with the utmost difficulty i could coax her out again
when she did come mr_heathcliff came with her and she insisted that i should take him into the kitchen as my fellow servant had gone to a neighbour to be removed from the sound of our devil psalmody as it pleased him to call it
i told them i intended by no means to encourage their tricks but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since yesterday dinner i would wink at his cheating mr_hindley that once
he went down i set him a stool by the fire and offered him a quantity of good things but he was sick and could eat little and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away
instead of finding her outside i heard her voice within he leant his two elbows on his knees and his chin on his hand and remained rapt in dumb meditation
on my inquiring the subject of his thoughts he answered gravely i trying to settle how i shall pay mr_hindley back i dont care how long i wait if i can only do it at last
i hope he will not die before i do for shame mr_heathcliff said i it is for god to punish wicked people we should learn to forgive
no god wont have the satisfaction that i shall he returned i only wish i knew the best way
let me alone and i ll plan it out while i thinking of that i dont feel pain but mr_lockwood i forget these tales cannot divert you
i annoyed how i should dream of chattering on at such a rate and your gruel cold and you nodding for bed
thus interrupting herself the housekeeper rose and proceeded to lay aside her sewing but i felt incapable of moving from the hearth and i was very far from nodding
i could have told mr_heathcliff history all that you need hear in half a dozen word sit still mrs ellen_dean i cried do sit still another half hour
you ve done just right to tell the story leisurely that is the method i like and you must finish it in the same style
i am interested in every character you have mentioned more or less the clock is on the stroke of eleven sir
no matter i not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours one or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten
a person who has not done one half his day work by ten clock runs a chance of leaving the other half undone
you shouldnt lie till ten there the very prime of the morning gone long before that time nevertheless mrs ellen_dean resume your chair because to morrow i intend lengthening the night till afternoon
i prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold at least i hope not sir well you must allow me to leap over some three year during that space mrs catherine_earnshaw
are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which if you were seated alone and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you you would watch the operation so intently that puss neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper a terribly lazy mood i should say
no no i ll allow nothing of the sort on the contrary a tiresomely active one it is mine at present and therefore continue minutely
i perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage to their various occupants and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the looker on
i could fancy a love for life here almost possible and i was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year standing
one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice the other introducing him to a table laid out by french cooks he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance
they do live more in earnest more in themselves and less in surface change and frivolous external things oh here we are the same as anywhere else when you get to know us
observed mrs ellen_dean somewhat puzzled at my speech excuse me i responded you my good friend are a striking evidence against that assertion
excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence you have no marks of the manners which i am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class
you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles
i certainly esteem myself a steady reasonable kind of body she said not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces and one series of actions from year end to year end but i have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom and then i have read more than you would fancy mr_lockwood
you could not open a book in this library that i have not looked into and got something out of also unless it be that range of greek and latin and that of french and those i know one from another it is as much as you can expect of a poor man daughter
however if i am to follow my story in true gossip fashion i had better go on and instead of leaping three year i will be content to pass to the next summer the summer of that is nearly twenty three year ago
chapter viii on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient catherine_earnshaw stock was born
we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran
i am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think mrs ellen_dean laughed oh such a grand bairn
she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says she been in a consumption these many months
i heard him tell mr_hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and she ll be dead before winter you must come home directly
you re to nurse it nelly_dean to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis
i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man
but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet she out of her head for joy it such a beauty
if i were her i certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of mr_kenneth
dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up when the old croaker steps forward and says he catherine_earnshaw it a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son
when she came i felt convinced we shouldnt keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her
i was fairly mad at him dont take on and fret about it too much it cant be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass
i think he swore but i didnt mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously
i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for mr_hindley sake
he had room in his heart only for two idols his wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i couldnt conceive how he would bear the loss
when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby
and what did the master answer i inquired nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile
and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says she damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right she ll be perfectly well by this time next week
i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she must tell her mr_kenneth says she must be quiet
i delivered this message to mrs catherine_earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily i hardly spoke a word ellen_dean and there he has gone out twice crying
are you going up stairs will you tell her that i ll come if she ll promise not to talk well say i promise i wont speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him
till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day
when mr_kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he neednt put him to further expense by attending her he retorted i know you need not
it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool
he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to morrow
a fit of coughing took her a very slight one he raised her in his arms she put her two hand about his neck her face changed and she was dead
poor soul she well she does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption as the girl had anticipated the child hareton_earnshaw fell wholly into my hand
mr catherine_earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament
the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay
i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his foster sister and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would
joseph remained to hector over tenant and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove
he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the master bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine_earnshaw and mr_heathcliff
his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period
he delighted to witness mr_hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had
the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff visits to miss_cathy might be an exception
at fifteen she was the queen of the country side she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature
i own i did not like her after infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though
she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even mr_heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young mrs_linton_heathcliff with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression
it used to hang on one side and his wife on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was
mrs ellen_dean raised the candle and i discerned a soft featured face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression
he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace can you make that out it formed a sweet picture
the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eye were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine_earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual
i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine_earnshaw
yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general
catherine_earnshaw had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella_linton and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one
in the place where she heard mr_heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise
a very agreeable portrait i observed to the house keeper is it like mr_edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly
he had a terror of catherine_earnshaw reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility
the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way
i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine_earnshaw she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when mr_heathcliff expressed contempt of mrs_linton_heathcliff in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when mrs_linton_heathcliff evinced disgust and antipathy to mr_heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her
that sounds ill natured but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility
she did bring herself finally to confess and to confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser
mr_hindley had gone from home one afternoon and mr_heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it
he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of
in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning
i ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery his childhood sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr catherine_earnshaw was faded away
he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine_earnshaw in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level
then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintances
catherine_earnshaw and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in word and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him
on the before named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss_cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr_edgar of her brother absence and was then preparing to receive him
miss_cathy are you busy this afternoon asked mr_heathcliff are you going anywhere no it is raining she answered
why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope not that i know of
stammered miss but you should be in the field now mr_heathcliff it is an hour past dinnertime i thought you were gone
mr_hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy i ll not work any more to day i ll stay with you
joseph is loading lime on the further side of penistone crags it will take him till dark and he ll never know
oh but joseph will tell she suggested you better go so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down
catherine_earnshaw reflected an instant with knitted brow she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella_linton and mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a minute silence
as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good
order ellen_dean to say you are engaged miss_cathy he persisted dont turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours
i on the point sometimes of complaining that they but i ll not that they what cried catherine_earnshaw gazing at him with a troubled countenance
oh nelly_dean she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hand you ve combed my hair quite out of curl that enough let me alone
nothing only look at the almanack on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and continued the crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me
what are you on the point of complaining about mr_heathcliff do you see i ve marked every day yes very foolish as if i took notice
replied catherine_earnshaw in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that to show that i do take notice said mr_heathcliff
and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about
you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either
you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company miss_cathy exclaimed mr_heathcliff in much agitation
her companion rose up but he hadnt time to express his feelings further for a horse feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young mrs_linton_heathcliff entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summon she had received
it no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered doubtless catherine_earnshaw marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out
the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect
he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his word as you do that less gruff than we talk here and softer
he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser
i not come too soon am i no answered catherine_earnshaw what are you doing there nelly_dean my work miss i replied
she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants dont commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are
it a good opportunity now that master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence
mr_hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits mrs_linton_heathcliff chose to pay i sure mr_edgar will excuse me
i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with mr_heathcliff
she supposing mr_edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm
i sorry for it miss catherine_earnshaw was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation i ve said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now
and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss that a nasty trick
you have no right to nip me and i not going to bear it i didnt touch you you lying creature
cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze
she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eye with water
what that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her catherine_earnshaw love catherine_earnshaw interposed mrs_linton_heathcliff greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed
little hareton_earnshaw who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt miss_cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and mr_edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hand to deliver him
in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest
i lifted hareton_earnshaw in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement
leave the room ellen_dean she repeated trembling all over he drew back in consternation the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip
that right i said to myself take warning and begone it a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition
where are you going demanded catherine_earnshaw advancing to the door he swerved aside and attempted to pass you must not go
she exclaimed energetically i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice no she persisted grasping the handle not yet mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff sit down you shall not leave me in that temper
i should be miserable all night and i wont be miserable for you can i stay after you have struck me asked mrs_linton_heathcliff
catherine_earnshaw was mute you ve made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued i ll not come here again her eye began to glisten and her lids to twinkle
and you told a deliberate untruth he said i didnt she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you please get away
and now i ll cry i ll cry myself sick she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest
mr_edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out
as bad as any marred child you better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us
the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten
and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that catherine_earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers
ah i thought there will be no saving him he doomed and flies to his fate intelligence of mr_hindley arrival drove mrs_linton_heathcliff speedily to his horse and catherine_earnshaw to her chamber
i went to hide little hareton_earnshaw and to take the shot out of the master fowling piece which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun
he entered vociferating oaths dreadful to hear and caught me in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard
hareton_earnshaw was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast fondness or his madman rage for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death and in the other of being flung into the fire or dashed against the wall and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever i chose to put him
chapter ix there i ve found it out at last cried mr_hindley pulling me back by the skin of my neck like a dog
by heaven and hell you ve sworn between you to murder that child i know how it is now that he is always out of my way
you neednt laugh for i ve just crammed mr_kenneth head downmost in the black horse marsh and two is the same as one and i want to kill some of you i shall have no rest till i do
but with the help of satan i shall make you swallow the carving knife nelly_dean but i dont like the carving knife mr_hindley i answered it has been cutting red herrings
i rather be shot if you please you rather be damned he said and so you shall no law in england can hinder a man from keeping his house decent and mine abominable
he held the knife in his hand and pushed its point between my teeth but for my part i was never much afraid of his vagaries
open your mouth i spat out and affirmed it tasted detestably i would not take it on any account oh said he releasing me i see that hideous little villain is not hareton_earnshaw
if it be he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me and for screaming as if i were a goblin
i beg your pardon nell unnatural cub come hither i ll teach thee to impose on a good hearted deluded father now dont you think the lad would be handsomer cropped
it makes a dog fiercer and i love something fierce get me a scissors something fierce and trim besides it infernal affectation devilish conceit it is to cherish our ears
we re asses enough without them hush child hush well then it is my darling wisht dry thy eye there a joy kiss me
what it wont kiss me hareton_earnshaw damn thee kiss me by god as if i would rear such a monster as sure as i living i ll break the brat neck
poor hareton_earnshaw was squalling and kicking in his father arms with all his might and redoubled his yells when he carried him up stairs and lifted him over the banister
as i reached them mr_hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below almost forgetting what he had in his hand
i cried out that he would frighten the child into fits and ran to rescue him who is that he asked hearing some one approaching the stairs foot
i leant forward also for the purpose of signing to mr_heathcliff whose step i recognised not to come further and at the instant when my eye quitted hareton_earnshaw he gave a sudden spring delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him and fell
mr_heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment by a natural impulse he arrested his descent and setting him on his feet looked up to discover the author of the accident
a miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of mr catherine_earnshaw above
it expressed plainer than word could do the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge
had it been dark i daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing hareton_earnshaw skull on the steps but we witnessed his salvation and i was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart
there was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe mr_hindley descended more leisurely sobered and abashed
it is your fault ellen_dean he said you should have kept him out of sight you should have taken him from me
is he injured anywhere injured i cried angrily if he is not killed he ll be an idiot oh i wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him
you re worse than a heathen treating your own flesh and blood in that manner he attempted to touch the child who on finding himself with me sobbed off his terror directly
at the first finger his father laid on him however he shrieked again louder than before and struggled as if he would go into convulsions
you shall not meddle with him i continued he hates you they all hate you that the truth a happy family you have and a pretty state you re come to
i shall come to a prettier yet nelly_dean laughed the misguided man recovering his hardness at present convey yourself and him away
and hark you mr_heathcliff clear you too quite from my reach and hearing i wouldnt murder you to night unless perhaps i set the house on fire but that as my fancy goes
while saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser and poured some into a tumbler nay dont
i entreated mr_hindley do take warning have mercy on this unfortunate boy if you care nothing for yourself any one will do better for him than i shall he answered
on the contrary i shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its maker exclaimed the blasphemer
have mercy on your own soul i said endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand not i here to its hearty damnation
he drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember
it a pity he cannot kill himself with drink observed mr_heathcliff muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut
mr_kenneth says he would wager his mare that he ll outlive any man on this side gimmerton_kirk and go to the grave a hoary sinner unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him
he doing his very utmost but his constitution defies him i went into the kitchen and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep
it turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle when he flung himself on a bench by the wall removed from the fire and remained silent
mr_heathcliff as i thought walked through to the barn i was rocking hareton_earnshaw on my knee and humming a song that began
the mither beneath the mools heard that when miss_cathy who had listened to the hubbub from her room put her head in and whispered are you alone nelly_dean
it was far in the night and the bairnies grat yes miss i replied she entered and approached the hearth i supposing she was going to say something looked up
her lips were half asunder as if she meant to speak and she drew a breath but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence
the expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious i resumed my song not having forgotten her recent behaviour where mr_heathcliff
she said interrupting me about his work in the stable was my answer he did not contradict me perhaps he had fallen into a doze
there followed another long pause during which i perceived a drop or two trickle from catherine_earnshaw cheek to the flags is she sorry for her shameful conduct i asked myself
that will be a novelty but she may come to the point as she will i sha nt help her no she felt small trouble regarding any subject save her own concerns
oh dear she cried at last i very unhappy a pity observed i you re hard to please so many friends and so few cares and cant make yourself content
she pursued kneeling down by me and lifting her winsome eye to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it
nelly_dean will you keep a secret for me is it worth keeping i inquired less sulkily yes and it worries me and i must let it out
i want to know what i should do to day mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff has asked me to marry him and i ve given him an answer
now before i tell you whether it was a consent or denial you tell me which it ought to have been
to be sure considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon i might say it would be wise to refuse him since he asked you after that he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool
really miss catherine_earnshaw how can i know i replied if you talk so i wont tell you any more she returned peevishly rising to her feet
i accepted him nelly_dean be quick and say whether i was wrong you accepted him then what good is it discussing the matter
you have pledged your word and cannot retract but say whether i should have done so do she exclaimed in an irritated tone chafing her hand together and frowning
there are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly i said sententiously first and foremost do you love mr_edgar who can help it
of course i do she answered then i put her through the following catechism for a girl of twenty two it was not injudicious
why do you love him miss_cathy nonsense i do that sufficient by no means you must say why
well because he is handsome and pleasant to be with bad was my commentary and because he is young and cheerful
and because he loves me indifferent coming there and he will be rich and i shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood and i shall be proud of having such a husband
bad still worst of all and now say how you love him as everybody loves you re silly nelly_dean not at all answer
i love the ground under his feet and the air over his head and everything he touches and every word he says
i love all his looks and all his actions and him entirely and altogether there now and why nay you are making a jest of it it is exceedingly ill natured
it no jest to me said the young lady scowling and turning her face to the fire i very far from jesting miss catherine_earnshaw i replied
the last however goes for nothing you would love him without that probably and with it you wouldnt unless he possessed the four former attractions
you love mr_edgar because he is handsome and young and cheerful and rich and loves you no to be sure not i should only pity him hate him perhaps if he were ugly and a clown
but there are several other handsome rich young men in the world handsomer possibly and richer than he is what should hinder you from loving them
if there be any they are out of my way i ve seen none like mr_edgar you may see some and he wont always be handsome and young and may not always be rich
he is now and i have only to do with the present i wish you would speak rationally well that settles it if you have only to do with the present marry mr mrs_linton_heathcliff
i dont want your permission for that i shall marry him and yet you have not told me whether i right
perfectly right if people be right to marry only for the present and now let us hear what you are unhappy about
your brother will be pleased the old lady and gentleman will not object i think you will escape from a disorderly comfortless home into a wealthy respectable one and you love mr_edgar and mr_edgar loves you
here and here replied catherine_earnshaw striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast in whichever place the soul lives
all seems smooth and easy where is the obstacle in my soul and in my heart i convinced i wrong
but if you will not mock at me i ll explain it i cant do it distinctly but i ll give you a feeling of how i feel
that very strange i cannot make it out it my secret she seated herself by me again her countenance grew sadder and graver and her clasped hand trembled
nelly_dean do you never dream queer dreams she said suddenly after some minutes reflection yes now and then i answered
and so do i i ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas
they ve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the colour of my mind and this is one i going to tell it but take care not to smile at any part of it
oh dont miss catherine_earnshaw i cried we re dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us come come be merry and like yourself
look at little hareton_earnshaw he dreaming nothing dreary how sweetly he smiles in his sleep yes and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude
however nelly_dean i shall oblige you to listen it not long and i ve no power to be merry to night i wont hear it i wont hear it
you remember him i daresay when he was just such another as that chubby thing nearly as young and innocent i repeated hastily
i was superstitious about dreams then and am still and catherine_earnshaw had an unusual gloom in her aspect that made me dread something from which i might shape a prophecy and foresee a fearful catastrophe
if i were in heaven nelly_dean i should be extremely miserable because you are not fit to go there i answered
she was vexed but she did not proceed apparently taking up another subject she recommenced in a short time all sinners would be miserable in heaven
but it is not for that i dreamt once that i was there i tell you i wont hearken to your dreams miss catherine_earnshaw
i ll go to bed i interrupted again she laughed and held me down for i made a motion to leave my chair
this is nothing cried she i was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home and i broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of wuthering heights where i woke sobbing for joy
i ve no more business to marry mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff than i have to be in heaven and if the wicked man in there had not brought mr_heathcliff so low i shouldnt have thought of it
it would degrade me to marry mr_heathcliff now so he shall never know how i love him and that not because he handsome nelly_dean but because he more myself than i am
whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same and mrs_linton_heathcliff is as different as a moonbeam from lightning or frost from fire
that will do to explain my secret as well as the other ere this speech ended i became sensible of mr_heathcliff presence
he had listened till he heard catherine_earnshaw say it would degrade her to marry him and then he stayed to hear no further
my companion sitting on the ground was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure but i started and bade her hush
having noticed a slight movement i turned my head and saw him rise from the bench and steal out noiselessly why
joseph is here i answered catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road and mr_heathcliff will come in with him
she asked gazing nervously round i not sure whether he were not at the door this moment oh he couldnt overhear me at the door
said she give me hareton_earnshaw while you get the supper and when it is ready ask me to sup with you
i want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience and be convinced that mr_heathcliff has no notion of these things he has not has he
he does not know what being in love is i see no reason that he should not know as well as you i returned and if you are his choice he ll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born
as soon as you become mrs_linton_heathcliff he loses friend and love and all have you considered how you ll bear the separation and how he ll bear to be quite deserted in the world
because miss catherine_earnshaw he quite deserted we separated she exclaimed with an accent of indignation who is to separate us pray
they ll meet the fate of milo not as long as i live ellen_dean for no mortal creature every mrs_linton_heathcliff on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before i could consent to forsake mr_heathcliff
oh that not what i intend that not what i mean i shouldnt be mrs_linton_heathcliff were such a price demanded he ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime
mr_edgar must shake off his antipathy and tolerate him at least he will when he learns my true feelings towards him
nelly_dean i see now you think me a selfish wretch but did it never strike you that if mr_heathcliff and i married we should be beggars
whereas if i marry mrs_linton_heathcliff i can aid mr_heathcliff to rise and place him out of my brother power with your husband money miss catherine_earnshaw
you ll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon and though i hardly a judge i think that the worst motive you ve given yet for being the wife of young mrs_linton_heathcliff
i asked it is not retorted she it is the best the others were the satisfaction of my whims and for mr_edgar sake too to satisfy him
i cannot express it but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you
this is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to mr_edgar and myself what were the use of my creation if i were entirely contained here
my great miseries in this world have been mr_heathcliff miseries and i watched and felt each from the beginning my great thought in living is himself
if all else perished and he remained i should still continue to be and if all else remained and he were annihilated the universe would turn to a mighty stranger
i should not seem a part of it my love for mrs_linton_heathcliff is like the foliage in the woods time will change it i well aware as winter changes the trees
my love for mr_heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight but necessary nelly_dean i am mr_heathcliff
he always always in my mind not as a pleasure any more than i am always a pleasure to myself but as my own being
it is impracticable and she paused and hid her face in the folds of my gown but i jerked it forcibly away
if i can make any sense of your nonsense miss i said it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying or else that you are a wicked unprincipled girl
so dont talk of our separation again i was out of patience with her folly but trouble me with no more secrets i ll not promise to keep them
she was about to insist when the entrance of joseph finished our conversation and catherine_earnshaw removed her seat to a corner and nursed hareton_earnshaw while i made the supper
after it was cooked my fellow servant and i began to quarrel who should carry some to mr_hindley and we didnt settle it till all was nearly cold
then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask if he wanted any for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone
you ll keep that she asked eagerly no i ll not promise i repeated and how isnt that nowt comed in fro th field be this time
what is he about girt idle seeght demanded the old man looking round for mr_heathcliff i ll call him i replied
he in the barn i ve no doubt i went and called but got no answer on returning i whispered to catherine_earnshaw that he had heard a good part of what she said
i was sure and told how i saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother conduct regarding him
she jumped up in a fine fright flung hareton_earnshaw on to the settle and ran to seek for her friend herself not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried or how her talk would have affected him
she was absent such a while that joseph proposed we should wait no longer he cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing
and on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarter of an hour supplication before meat and would have tacked another to the end of the grace had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road and wherever mr_heathcliff had rambled find and make him re enter directly
they were ill eneugh for ony fahl manners he affirmed i want to speak to him and i must before i go upstairs she said
and the gate is open he is somewhere out of hearing for he would not reply though i shouted at the top of the fold as loud as i could
joseph objected at first she was too much in earnest however to suffer contradiction and at last he placed his hat on his head and walked grumbling forth
meantime catherine_earnshaw paced up and down the floor exclaiming i wonder where he is i wonder where he can be what did i say nelly_dean
i ve forgotten was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon dear tell me what i ve said to grieve him i do wish he come
i do wish he would what a noise for nothing i cried though rather uneasy myself what a trifle scares you
it surely no great cause of alarm that mr_heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay loft
i ll engage he lurking there see if i dont ferret him out i departed to renew my search its result was disappointment and joseph quest ended in the same
he left th gate att full swing and miss pony has trodden dahn two rigs corn and plottered through raight er intot meadow
yon lad gets war und war observed he on re entering hahsomdivert maister ull playt devil to morn and he ll do weel
he patience itsseln wi sich careless offald craters patience itsseln he is bud he ll not be soa allus yah see all on ye
yah mun nt drive him out of his heead for nowt have you found mr_heathcliff you ass interrupted catherine_earnshaw have you been looking for him as i ordered i sud more likker look for th horse he replied
it ud be to more sense bud i can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this as black ast chimbley
it was a very dark evening for summer the clouds appeared inclined to thunder and i said we had better all sit down the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble
und mr_heathcliff noant chap to coom at my whistle happen he ll be less hard hearing wi ye however catherine_earnshaw would not be persuaded into tranquillity
she kept wandering to and fro from the gate to the door in a state of agitation which permitted no repose and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall near the road where heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder and the great drops that began to plash around her she remained calling at intervals and then listening and then crying outright
she beat hareton_earnshaw or any child at a good passionate fit of crying about midnight while we still sat up the storm came rattling over the heights in full fury
there was a violent wind as well as thunder and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building a huge bough fell across the roof and knocked down a portion of the east chimney stack sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen fire
we thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us and joseph swung on to his knees beseeching the lord to remember the patriarchs noah and lot and as in former time spare the righteous though he smote the ungodly
the jonah in my mind was mr catherine_earnshaw and i shook the handle of his den that i might ascertain if he were yet living
he replied audibly enough in a fashion which made my companion vociferate more clamorously than before that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master
but the uproar passed away in twenty minutes leaving us all unharmed excepting miss_cathy who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes
she came in and lay down on the settle all soaked as she was turning her face to the back and putting her hand before it
i felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also well miss i exclaimed touching her shoulder you are not bent on getting your death are you
do you know what clock it is half past twelve come come to bed there no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy he ll be gone to gimmerton_kirk and he ll stay there now
he guesses we shouldnt wait for him till this late hour at least he guesses that only mr_hindley would be up and he rather avoid having the door opened by the master
nay nay he noan at gimmerton_kirk said joseph i niver wonder but he att bothom of a bog hoile this visitation wornt for nowt and
i wod hev ye to look out miss yah muh bet next thank hivin for all all warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen and piked out fro th rubbidge
yah knaw whett scripture ses and he began quoting several texts referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them
i having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things left him preaching and her shivering and betook myself to bed with little hareton_earnshaw who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him
i heard joseph read on a while afterwards then i distinguished his slow step on the ladder and then i dropped asleep
coming down somewhat later than usual i saw by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters miss catherine_earnshaw still seated near the fireplace
the house door was ajar too light entered from its unclosed window mr_hindley had come out and stood on the kitchen hearth haggard and drowsy
what ails you miss_cathy he was saying when i entered you look as dismal as a drowned whelp why are you so damp and pale child
i ve been wet she answered reluctantly and i cold that all oh she is naughty i cried perceiving the master to be tolerably sober
she got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening and there she has sat the night through and i couldnt prevail on her to stir
mr catherine_earnshaw stared at us in surprise the night through he repeated what kept her up not fear of the thunder surely
neither of us wished to mention mr_heathcliff absence as long as we could conceal it so i replied i didnt know how she took it into her head to sit up and she said nothing
the morning was fresh and cool i threw back the lattice and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden but catherine_earnshaw called peevishly to me ellen_dean shut the window
that was over hours since i starving and her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers
she ill said mr_hindley taking her wrist i suppose that the reason she would not go to bed damn it i dont want to be troubled with more sickness here
what took you into the rain running aftert lads as usuald croaked joseph catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue
if i war yah maister i just slamt boards i their faces all on em gentle and simple never a day ut yah re off but yon
shoo sits watching for ye it kitchen and as yah re in at one door he out att other and then wer grand lady goes a courting of her side
it bonny behaviour lurking amangt fields after twelve ot night wi that fahl flaysome divil of a gipsy mr_heathcliff
cat mrs_linton_heathcliff comes sneaking hither and miss nelly_dean shoo a fine lass they think i blind but i noan nowt
seed young mrs_linton_heathcliff boath coming and going and i seed yah directing his discourse to me yah gooid fur nowt slattenly witch
utt soart i nip up and bolt into th houset minute yah heardt maister horse fit clatter upt road
mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff came yesterday by chance mr_hindley and it was i who told him to be off because i knew you would not like to have met him as you were
silence eavesdropper cried catherine_earnshaw none of your insolence before me you lie miss_cathy no doubt answered her brother and you are a confounded simpleton
but never mind mrs_linton_heathcliff at present tell me were you not with mr_heathcliff last night speak the truth now you need not be afraid of harming him though i hate him as much as ever he did me
to prevent it i shall send him about his business this very morning and after he gone i advise you all to look sharp i shall only have the more humour for you
i never saw mr_heathcliff last night answered catherine_earnshaw beginning to sob bitterly and if you do turn him out of door i ll go with him
a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck but perhaps you ll never have an opportunity perhaps he gone
mr_hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse and bade her get to her room immediately or she shouldnt cry for nothing
i obliged her to obey and i shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber it terrified me
here she burst into uncontrollable grief and the remainder of her word were inarticulate i thought she was going mad and i begged joseph to run for the doctor
it proved the commencement of delirium mr_kenneth as soon as he saw her pronounced her dangerously ill she had a fever
he bled her and he told me to let her live on whey and water gruel and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window and then he left for he had enough to do in the parish where two or three mile was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage
though i cannot say i made a gentle nurse and joseph and the master were no better and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be she weathered it through
old mrs_linton_heathcliff paid us several visits to be sure and set things to rights and scolded and ordered us all and when catherine_earnshaw was convalescent she insisted on conveying her to thrushcross_grange for which deliverance we were very grateful
but the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness she and her husband both took the fever and died within a few days of each other
mr_heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunder storm and one day i had the misfortune when she had provoked me exceedingly to lay the blame of his disappearance on her where indeed it belonged as she well knew
from that period for several months she ceased to hold any communication with me save in the relation of a mere servant
joseph fell under a ban also he would speak his mind and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl and she esteemed herself a woman and our mistress and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration
then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much she ought to have her own way and it was nothing less than murder in her eye for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her
from mr catherine_earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof and tutored by mr_kenneth and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper
he was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices not from affection but from pride he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the lintons and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves for aught he cared
mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff as multitudes have been before and will be after him was infatuated and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to gimmerton_kirk chapel three year subsequent to his father death
our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate and haughtier than ever much against my inclination i was persuaded to leave wuthering heights and accompany her here
little hareton_earnshaw was nearly five year old and i had just begun to teach him his letters we made a sad parting but catherine_earnshaw tears were more powerful than ours
when i refused to go and when she found her entreaties did not move me she went lamenting to her husband and brother
the former offered me munificent wages the latter ordered me to pack up he wanted no women in the house he said now that there was no mistress and as to hareton_earnshaw the curate should take him in hand by and by
i told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster i kissed hareton_earnshaw said good by and since then he has been a stranger and it very queer to think it but i ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about ellen_dean and that he was ever more than all the world to her
at this point of the housekeeper story she chanced to glance towards the time piece over the chimney and was in amazement on seeing the minute hand measure half past one
she would not hear of staying a second longer in truth i felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself
and now that she is vanished to her rest and i have meditated for another hour or two i shall summon courage to go also in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs
and so i had but one choice left to do as i was ordered and she to him chapter a charming introduction to a hermit life
four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons
and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of mr_kenneth that i need not expect to be out of door till spring
mr_heathcliff has just honoured me with a call about seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse the last of the season
scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him
how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches
but alas this is quite an easy interval i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting
why not have up mrs ellen_dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone
i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three year and the heroine was married
yes i ll ring she ll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully mrs ellen_dean came it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced
away away with it i replied i desire to have the doctor says you must drop the powders with all my heart
draw your knitting out of your pocket that will do now continue the history of mr_heathcliff from where you left off to the present day
dont interrupt me come and take your seat here keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman
or did he get a sizar place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster country or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways
i stated before that i didnt know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave i ll proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you
he may have done a little in all these vocations mr_lockwood but i couldnt give my word for any are you feeling better this morning
i got miss catherine_earnshaw and myself to thrushcross_grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared to expect
much that good news she seemed almost over fond of mr mrs_linton_heathcliff and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection
they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn
one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be ill natured and bad tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference
he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account
he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed
not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it
catherine_earnshaw had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before
there were no mutual concessions i observed that mr_edgar had a deep rooted fear of ruffling her humour the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him
well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one interest was not the chief consideration in the other thoughts
on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering
it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building
i set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eye were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say nelly_dean is that you
it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar
i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the door were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps
something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair
i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness it ended he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself
the voice has no resemblance to his i have waited here an hour he resumed while i continued staring and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death
who can it be i thought mr catherine_earnshaw oh no i dared not enter you do not know me look i not a stranger
a ray fell on his features the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black whiskers the brow lowering the eye deep set and singular
i remembered the eye what i cried uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor and i raised my hand in amazement
yes mr_heathcliff he replied glancing from me up to the window which reflected a score of glittering moons but showed no light from within
what you come back is it really you is it are they at home where is she nelly_dean you are not glad
you neednt be so disturbed is she here speak i want to have one word with her your mistress go and say some person from gimmerton_kirk desires to see her
how will she take it i exclaimed what will she do the surprise bewilders me it will put her out of her head
and you are mr_heathcliff but altered nay there no comprehending it have you been for a soldier go and carry my message he interrupted impatiently
he lifted the latch and i entered but when i got to the parlour where mr and mrs_linton_heathcliff were i could not persuade myself to proceed
at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted and i opened the door
they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall and displayed beyond the garden trees and the wild green park the valley of gimmerton_kirk with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top for very soon after you pass the chapel as you may have noticed the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen
wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour but our old house was invisible it rather dips down on the other side
i in hell till you do both the room and its occupants and the scene they gazed on looked wondrously peaceful
i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand and was actually going away leaving it unsaid after having put my question about the candles when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and mutter a person from gimmerton_kirk wishes to see you ma am what does he want asked mrs_linton_heathcliff
i did not question him i answered well close the curtains nelly_dean she said and bring up tea i ll be back again directly
she quitted the apartment mr_edgar inquired carelessly who it was some one mistress does not expect i replied
that mr_heathcliff you recollect him sir who used to live at mr catherine_earnshaw what the gipsy the ploughboy he cried why did you not say so to catherine_earnshaw
hush you must not call him by those names master i said she be sadly grieved to hear you she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off
i guess his return will make a jubilee to her mr mrs_linton_heathcliff walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court
he unfastened it and leant out i suppose they were below for he exclaimed quickly dont stand there love bring the person in if it be anyone particular
ere long i heard the click of the latch and catherine_earnshaw flew up stairs breathless and wild too excited to show gladness indeed by her face you would rather have surmised an awful calamity
oh mr_edgar edgar she panted flinging her arms round his neck oh mr_edgar darling mr_heathcliff come back he is and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze
well well cried her husband crossly dont strangle me for that he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure there is no need to be frantic
i know you didnt like him she answered repressing a little the intensity of her delight yet for my sake you must be friends now
shall i tell him to come up here he said into the parlour where else she asked he looked vexed and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him
mrs_linton_heathcliff eyed him with a droll expression half angry half laughing at his fastidiousness no she added after a while i cannot sit in the kitchen
set two tables here ellen_dean one for your master and miss isabella_linton being gentry the other for mr_heathcliff and myself being of the lower orders
will that please you dear or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere if so give directions i ll run down and secure my guest
i afraid the joy is too great to be real she was about to dart off again but mr_edgar arrested her
you bid him step up he said addressing me and catherine_earnshaw try to be glad without being absurd the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother
he followed my guidance without waste of word and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking
but the lady glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door she sprang forward took both his hand and led him to mrs_linton_heathcliff and then she seized mrs_linton_heathcliff reluctant fingers and crushed them into his
i descended and found mr_heathcliff waiting under the porch evidently anticipating an invitation to enter now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight i was amazed more than ever to behold the transformation of mr_heathcliff
he had grown a tall athletic well formed man beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth like his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army
his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr mrs_linton_heathcliff it looked intelligent and retained no marks of former degradation
a half civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brow and eye full of black fire but it was subdued and his manner was even dignified quite divested of roughness though stern for grace
my master surprise equalled or exceeded mine he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy as he had called him
mr_heathcliff dropped his slight hand and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak sit down sir he said at length
mrs_linton_heathcliff recalling old time would have me give you a cordial reception and of course i am gratified when anything occurs to please her
and i also answered mr_heathcliff especially if it be anything in which i have a part i shall stay an hour or two willingly
he took a seat opposite catherine_earnshaw who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it
a quick glance now and then sufficed but it flashed back each time more confidently the undisguised delight he drank from hers
not so mr_edgar he grew pale with pure annoyance a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose and stepping across the rug seized mr_heathcliff hand again and laughed like one beside herself
he did not raise his to her often they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment i shall think it a dream to morrow
she cried i shall not be able to believe that i have seen and touched and spoken to you once more
and yet cruel mr_heathcliff you dont deserve this welcome to be absent and silent for three year and never to think of me
i heard of your marriage miss_cathy not long since and while waiting in the yard below i meditated this plan just to have one glimpse of your face a stare of surprise perhaps and pretended pleasure afterwards settle my score with mr_hindley and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself
a little more than you have thought of me he murmured your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time
i ve fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice and you must forgive me for i struggled only for you
catherine_earnshaw unless we are to have cold tea please to come to the table interrupted mrs_linton_heathcliff striving to preserve his ordinary tone and a due measure of politeness
nay you ll not drive me off again you were really sorry for me were you well there was cause mr_heathcliff will have a long walk wherever he may lodge to night and i thirsty
she took her post before the urn and miss isabella_linton came summoned by the bell then having handed their chairs forward i left the room
the meal hardly endured ten minutes catherine_earnshaw cup was never filled she could neither eat nor drink mr_edgar had made a slop in his saucer and scarcely swallowed a mouthful
their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer i asked as he departed if he went to gimmerton_kirk
no to wuthering heights he answered mr catherine_earnshaw invited me when i called this morning mr catherine_earnshaw invited him
and he called on mr catherine_earnshaw i pondered this sentence painfully after he was gone is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak
about the middle of the night i was wakened from my first nap by mrs_linton_heathcliff gliding into my chamber taking a seat on my bedside and pulling me by the hair to rouse me
i mused i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away i cannot rest ellen_dean she said by way of apology
mr_edgar is sulky because i glad of a thing that does not interest him he refuses to open his mouth except to utter pettish silly speeches and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy
and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness he always contrives to be sick at the least cross
i gave a few sentences of commendation to mr_heathcliff and he either for a headache or a pang of envy began to cry
so i got up and left him what use is it praising mr_heathcliff to him i answered as lads they had an aversion to each other and mr_heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised
it human nature let mr mrs_linton_heathcliff alone about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them but does it not show great weakness
i never feel hurt at the brightness of isabella_linton yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin at her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her
even you nelly_dean if we have a dispute sometimes you back isabella_linton at once and i yield like a foolish mother
pursued she i not envious i call her a darling and flatter her into a good temper it pleases her brother to see us cordial and that pleases me
but they are very much alike they are spoiled child and fancy the world was made for their accommodation and though i humour both i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same
you re mistaken mrs_linton_heathcliff said i they humour you i know what there would be to do if they did not
you may however fall out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you
you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires and then we shall fight to the death
i tell you i have such faith in mrs_linton_heathcliff love that i believe i might kill him and he wouldnt wish to retaliate
sha nt we nelly_dean she returned laughing no i advised her to value him the more for his affection i do she answered but he neednt resort to whining for trifles
it is childish and instead of melting into tears because i said that mr_heathcliff was now worthy of anyone regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend he ought to have said it for me and been delighted from sympathy
he must get accustomed to him and he may as well like him considering how mr_heathcliff has reason to object to him
he is reformed in every respect apparently quite a christian offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around
i sure he behaved excellently what do you think of his going to wuthering heights i inquired he explained it she replied
he said he called to gather information concerning me from you supposing you resided there still and joseph told mr_hindley who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing and how he had been living and finally desired him to walk in
there were some persons sitting at cards mr_heathcliff joined them my brother lost some money to him and finding him plentifully supplied he requested that he would come again in the evening to which he consented
mr_hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently he doesnt trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured
but mr_heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange and an attachment to the house where we lived together and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton_kirk
he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights and doubtless my brother covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms he was always greedy though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other
it a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in said i have you no fear of the consequences mrs_linton_heathcliff
none for my friend she replied his strong head will keep him from danger a little for mr_hindley but he cant be made morally worse than he is and i stand between him and bodily harm
i wonder as much as you the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity i had risen in angry rebellion against providence
oh i ve endured very very bitter misery nelly_dean if that creature knew how bitter he be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance
it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone had i expressed the agony i frequently felt he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as i however it over and i ll take no revenge on his folly i can afford to suffer anything hereafter
should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek i not only turn the other but i ask pardon for provoking it and as a proof i ll go make my peace with mr_edgar instantly
in this self complacent conviction she departed and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow mr mrs_linton_heathcliff had not only abjured his peevishness though his spirits seemed still subdued by catherine_earnshaw exuberance of vivacity but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella_linton with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine
i should say in future used the liberty of visiting at thrushcross_grange cautiously at first he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion
catherine_earnshaw also deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him and he gradually established his right to be expected
he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling
good night i an angel mr_heathcliff mr_heathcliff my master uneasiness experienced a lull and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space
his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella_linton mrs_linton_heathcliff evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest
she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen infantile in manners though possessed of keen wit keen feelings and a keen temper too if irritated
leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man and the possible fact that his property in default of heirs male might pass into such a one power he had sense to comprehend mr_heathcliff disposition to know that though his exterior was altered his mind was unchangeable and unchanged
her brother who loved her tenderly was appalled at this fantastic preference and he dreaded that mind it revolted him he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella_linton to its keeping
he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on mr_heathcliff deliberate designing
we had all remarked during some time that miss mrs_linton_heathcliff fretted and pined over something she grew cross and wearisome snapping at and teasing catherine_earnshaw continually at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience
but one day when she had been peculiarly wayward rejecting her breakfast complaining that the servants did not do what she told them that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house and mr_edgar neglected her that she had caught a cold with the door being left open and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations mrs_linton_heathcliff peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed and having scolded her heartily threatened to send for the doctor
mention of mr_kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect and it was only catherine_earnshaw harshness which made her unhappy
we excused her to a certain extent on the plea of ill health she was dwindling and fading before our eye how can you say i am harsh you naughty fondling cried the mistress amazed at the unreasonable assertion
you are surely losing your reason when have i been harsh tell me yesterday sobbed isabella_linton and now yesterday said her sister in law
in our walk along the moor you told me to ramble where i pleased while you sauntered on with mr_heathcliff
on what occasion and that your notion of harshness said catherine_earnshaw laughing it was no hint that your company was superfluous
we didnt care whether you kept with us or not i merely thought mr_heathcliff talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears
oh no wept the young lady you wished me away because you knew i liked to be there is she sane asked mrs_linton_heathcliff appealing to me
i ll repeat our conversation word for word isabella_linton and you point out any charm it could have had for you i dont mind the conversation she answered i wanted to be with well said catherine_earnshaw perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence
with him and i wont be always sent off she continued kindling up you are a dog in the manger miss_cathy and desire no one to be loved but yourself
you are an impertinent little monkey exclaimed mrs_linton_heathcliff in surprise but i ll not believe this idiotcy it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of mr_heathcliff that you consider him an agreeable person
i hope i have misunderstood you isabella_linton no you have not said the infatuated girl i love him more than ever you loved mr_edgar and he might love me if you would let him
i wouldnt be you for a kingdom then catherine_earnshaw declared emphatically and she seemed to speak sincerely nelly_dean help me to convince her of her madness
i as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him
tell her what mr_heathcliff is an unreclaimed creature without refinement without cultivation an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone it is deplorable ignorance of his character child and nothing else which makes that dream enter your head
pray dont imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior he not a rough diamond a pearl containing oyster of a rustic he a fierce pitiless wolfish man
i never say to him let this or that enemy alone because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them i say let them alone because i should hate them to be wronged
and he crush you like a sparrow egg isabella_linton if he found you a troublesome charge i know he couldnt love a mrs_linton_heathcliff and yet he be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations
that had he thought seriously to catch you i should perhaps have held my tongue and let you fall into his trap
avarice is growing with him a besetting sin there my picture and i his friend so much so miss mrs_linton_heathcliff regarded her sister in law with indignation
for shame for shame she repeated angrily you are worse than twenty foes you poisonous friend ah you wont believe me then said catherine_earnshaw
you think i speak from wicked selfishness i certain you do retorted isabella_linton and i shudder at you good cried the other
try for yourself if that be your spirit i have done and yield the argument to your saucy insolence and i must suffer for her egotism
she sobbed as mrs_linton_heathcliff left the room all all is against me she has blighted my single consolation but she uttered falsehoods didnt she
mr_heathcliff is not a fiend he has an honourable soul and a true one or how could he remember her
banish him from your thoughts miss i said he a bird of bad omen no mate for you mrs_linton_heathcliff spoke strongly and yet i cant contradict her
she is better acquainted with his heart than i or any one besides and she never would represent him as worse than he is
honest people dont hide their deeds how has he been living how has he got rich why is he staying at wuthering heights the house of a man whom he abhors
they sit up all night together continually and mr_hindley has been borrowing money on his land and does nothing but play and drink i heard only a week ago it was joseph who told me
they say mr catherine_earnshaw is worse and worse since he came i met him at gimmerton_kirk nelly_dean he said we hae a crowner quest enow at ahr folks
one on em a most getten his finger cut off wi haudingt other fro stickin hisseln loike a cawlf that maister
he noan feared ot bench judges norther paul nur peter nur john nur matthew nor noan on em not he
yeah knaw at soa up going tuht grand sizes he fair likes he langs to set his brazened face agean em
and yon bonny lad mr_heathcliff yah mind he a rare un he can girn a laugh as well onybody at a raight divil jest
this ist way ont up at sun down dice brandy cloised shutters und can le light till next day at noon thent fooil gangs banning und raving to his cham er makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i thur lugs fur varry shame un the knave why he can caint his brass un ate un sleep un off to his neighbour to gossip wit wife
i course he tells dame catherine_earnshaw how her fathur goold runs into his pocket and her fathur son gallops downt broad road while he flees afore to oppent pikes
now miss mrs_linton_heathcliff joseph is an old rascal but no liar and if his account of mr_heathcliff conduct be true you would never think of desiring such a husband would you
does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us when he goes tot grange you are leagued with the rest ellen_dean
she replied i ll not listen to your slanders what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world
whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually i cannot say she had little time to reflect
the day after there was a justice meeting at the next town my master was obliged to attend and mr_heathcliff aware of his absence called rather earlier than usual
catherine_earnshaw and isabella_linton were sitting in the library on hostile terms but silent the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion the former on mature consideration really offended with her companion and if she laughed again at her pertness inclined to make it no laughing matter to her
she did laugh as she saw mr_heathcliff pass the window i was sweeping the hearth and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips
isabella_linton absorbed in her meditations or a book remained till the door opened and it was too late to attempt an escape which she would gladly have done had it been practicable
here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them and you are the very one we should both of us choose
come in that right exclaimed the mistress gaily pulling a chair to the fire mr_heathcliff i proud to show you at last somebody that dotes on you more than myself
i expect you to feel flattered nay it not nelly_dean dont look at her my poor little sister in law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty
no no isabella_linton you sha nt run off she continued arresting with feigned playfulness the confounded girl who had risen indignantly
we were quarrelling like cats about you mr_heathcliff and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration and moreover i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside my rival as she will have herself to be would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever and send my image into eternal oblivion
catherine_earnshaw said isabella_linton calling up her dignity and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her i thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me even in joke
mr_heathcliff be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression
as the guest answered nothing but took his seat and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor
it lies in your own power to be mr_edgar brother by no means cried mrs_linton_heathcliff in answer i wont be named a dog in the manger again
you shall stay now then mr_heathcliff why dont you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news isabella_linton swears that the love mr_edgar has for me is nothing to
and she has fasted ever since the day before yesterday walk from sorrow and rage that i despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable
that she entertains for you i sure she made some speech of the kind did she not ellen_dean i think you belie her said mr_heathcliff twisting his chair to face them
and he stared hard at the object of discourse as one might do at a strange repulsive animal a centipede from the indies for instance which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises
the poor thing couldnt bear that she grew white and red in rapid succession and while tears beaded her lashes bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine_earnshaw and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down and she could not remove the whole together she began to make use of her nails and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer with crescents of red
she wishes to be out of my society now at any rate there a tigress exclaimed mrs_linton_heathcliff setting her free and shaking her hand with pain
begone for god sake and hide your vixen face how foolish to reveal those talons to him cant you fancy the conclusions he ll draw
i wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me he answered brutally when the door had closed after her
look mr_heathcliff they are instruments that will do execution you must beware of your eye but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner miss_cathy
she has been dying for your sake several weeks and raving about you this morning and pouring forth a deluge of abuse because i represented your failings in a plain light for the purpose of mitigating her adoration
you were not speaking the truth were you i assure you i was she returned but dont notice it further i wished to punish her sauciness that all
i like her too well my dear mr_heathcliff to let you absolutely seize and devour her up and i like her too ill to attempt it said he except in a very ghoulish fashion
you hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish waxen face the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow and turning the blue eye black every day or two they detestably resemble mrs_linton_heathcliff
delectably observed catherine_earnshaw they are dove eye angel she her brother heir is she not he asked after a brief silence
i should be sorry to think so returned his companion half a dozen nephews shall erase her title please heaven
abstract your mind from the subject at present you are too prone to covet your neighbour goods remember this neighbour goods are mine
that said mr_heathcliff but though isabella_linton mrs_linton_heathcliff may be silly she is scarcely mad and in short we ll dismiss the matter as you advise
if they were mine they would be none the less from their tongues they did dismiss it and catherine_earnshaw probably from her thoughts
i saw him smile to himself grin rather and lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs_linton_heathcliff had occasion to be absent from the apartment
the other i felt certain recalled it often in the course of the evening i determined to watch his movements my heart invariably cleaved to the master in preference to catherine_earnshaw side
with reason i imagined for he was kind and trustful and honourable and she she could not be called opposite yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that i had little faith in her principles and still less sympathy for her feelings
i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr_heathcliff quietly leaving us as we had been prior to his advent
his visits were a continual nightmare to me and i suspected to my master also his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining
i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold waiting his time to spring and destroy
sometimes while meditating on these things in solitude i ve got up in a sudden terror and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm
i ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways and then i ve recollected his confirmed bad habits and hopeless of benefiting him have flinched from re entering the dismal house doubting if i could bear to be taken at my word
it was about the period that my narrative has reached a bright frosty afternoon the ground bare and the road hard and dry
i came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand a rough sand pillar with the letters h cut on its north side on the east and on the south westt
chapter xi one time i passed the old gate going out of my way on a journey to gimmerton_kirk it serves as a guide post to the grange the heights and village
the sun shone yellow on its grey head reminding me of summer and i cannot say why but all at once a gush of child sensations flowed into my heart
i gazed long at the weather worn block and stooping down perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail shells and pebbles which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things and as fresh as reality it appeared that i beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf his dark square head bent forward and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate
i started my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine
mr_hindley and i held it a favourite spot twenty year before poor mr_hindley i exclaimed involuntarily it vanished in a twinkling but immediately i felt an irresistible yearning to be at the heights
superstition urged me to comply with this impulse supposing he should be dead i thought or should die soon supposing it were a sign of death
the nearer i got to the house the more agitated i grew and on catching sight of it i trembled in every limb
the apparition had outstripped me it stood looking through the gate that was my first idea on observing an elf locked brown eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars
further reflection suggested this must be hareton_earnshaw my hareton_earnshaw not altered greatly since i left him ten months since god bless thee darling
i cried forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears hareton_earnshaw it nelly_dean nelly thy nurse he retreated out of arm length and picked up a large flint
i am come to see thy father hareton_earnshaw i added guessing from the action that nelly_dean if she lived in his memory at all was not recognised as one with me
he raised his missile to hurl it i commenced a soothing speech but could not stay his hand the stone struck my bonnet and then ensued from the stammering lips of the little fellow a string of curses which whether he comprehended them or not were delivered with practised emphasis and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity
you may be certain this grieved more than angered me fit to cry i took an orange from my pocket and offered it to propitiate him
he hesitated and then snatched it from my hold as if he fancied i only intended to tempt and disappoint him
i showed another keeping it out of his reach who has taught you those fine word my bairn i inquired
the curate damn the curate and thee gie me that he replied tell us where you got your lessons and you shall have it said i
who your master devil daddy was his answer and what do you learn from daddy i continued he jumped at the fruit i raised it higher
what does he teach you i asked naught said he but to keep out of his gait daddy cannot bide me because i swear at him
ah and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy i observed ay nay he drawled who then mr_heathcliff
i asked if he liked mr_heathcliff ay he answered again desiring to have his reason for liking him i could only gather the sentences i known t
he pays dad back what he gies to me he curses daddy for cursing me he says i mun do as i will
no i was told the curate should have his teeth dashed down his throat if he stepped over the threshold mr_heathcliff had promised that
i put the orange in his hand and bade him tell his father that a woman called nelly_dean ellen_dean was waiting to speak with him by the garden gate
he went up the walk and entered the house but instead of mr_hindley mr_heathcliff appeared on the door stones and i turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever i could race making no halt till i gained the guide post and feeling as scared as if i had raised a goblin
this is not much connected with miss isabella_linton affair except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the grange even though i should wake a domestic storm by thwarting mrs_linton_heathcliff pleasure
and the curate does not teach you to read and write then i pursued the next time mr_heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court
she had never spoken a word to her sister in law for three days but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining and we found it a great comfort
mr_heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on miss mrs_linton_heathcliff i knew now as soon as he beheld her his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house front
he then stepped across the pavement to her and said something she seemed embarrassed and desirous of getting away to prevent it he laid his hand on her arm
i was standing by the kitchen window but i drew out of sight she averted her face he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer
there was another rapid glance at the house and supposing himself unseen the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her
judas traitor i ejaculated you are a hypocrite too are you a deliberate deceiver who is nelly_dean said catherine_earnshaw voice at my elbow
i had been over intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance your worthless friend i answered warmly the sneaking rascal yonder
i wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to miss when he told you he hated her
ah he has caught a glimpse of us he is coming in mrs_linton_heathcliff saw isabella_linton tear herself free and run into the garden and a minute after mr_heathcliff opened the door
i couldnt withhold giving some loose to my indignation but catherine_earnshaw angrily insisted on silence and threatened to order me out of the kitchen if i dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue
to hear you people might think you were the mistress she cried you want setting down in your right place
i said you must let isabella_linton alone i beg you will unless you are tired of being received here and wish mrs_linton_heathcliff to draw the bolts against you
mr_heathcliff what are you about raising this stir god forbid that he should try answered the black villain i detested him just then
god keep him meek and patient every day i grow madder after sending him to heaven hush said catherine_earnshaw shutting the inner door
dont vex me why have you disregarded my request did she come across you on purpose what is it to you
he growled i have a right to kiss her if she chooses and you have no right to object i am not your husband you neednt be jealous of me
i not jealous of you replied the mistress i jealous for you clear your face you sha nt scowl at me
if you like isabella_linton you shall marry her but do you like her tell the truth mr_heathcliff there you wont answer
i certain you dont and would mr mrs_linton_heathcliff approve of his sister marrying that man i inquired mr mrs_linton_heathcliff should approve returned my lady decisively
he might spare himself the trouble said mr_heathcliff i could do as well without his approbation and as to you catherine_earnshaw i have a mind to speak a few word now while we are at it
and if you flatter yourself that i dont perceive it you are a fool and if you think i can be consoled by sweet word you are an idiot and if you fancy i ll suffer unrevenged i ll convince you of the contrary in a very little while
i want you to be aware that i know you have treated me infernally infernally do you hear meantime thank you for telling me your sister in law secret
i swear i ll make the most of it and stand you aside what new phase of his character is this exclaimed mrs_linton_heathcliff in amazement
i ve treated you infernally and you ll take your revenge how will you take it ungrateful brute how have i treated you infernally i seek no revenge on you replied mr_heathcliff less vehemently
that not the plan the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
you are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style and refrain from insult as much as you are able
having levelled my palace dont erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home
if i imagined you really wished me to marry isabel i cut my throat oh the evil is that i am not jealous is it cried catherine_earnshaw
well i wont repeat my offer of a wife it is as bad as offering satan a lost soul your bliss lies like his in inflicting misery
mr_edgar is restored from the ill temper he gave way to at your coming i begin to be secure and tranquil and you restless to know us at peace appear resolved on exciting a quarrel
quarrel with mr_edgar if you please mr_heathcliff and deceive his sister you ll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me
you prove it the conversation ceased mrs_linton_heathcliff sat down by the fire flushed and gloomy the spirit which served her was growing intractable she could neither lay nor control it
he stood on the hearth with folded arms brooding on his evil thoughts and in this position i left them to seek the master who was wondering what kept catherine_earnshaw below so long
ellen_dean said he when i entered have you seen your mistress yes she in the kitchen sir i answered
she sadly put out by mr_heathcliff behaviour and indeed i do think it time to arrange his visits on another footing
there harm in being too soft and now it come to this and i related the scene in the court and as near as i dared the whole subsequent dispute
i fancied it could not be very prejudicial to mrs_linton_heathcliff unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the defensive for her guest
mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff had difficulty in hearing me to the close his first word revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame
this is insufferable he exclaimed it is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend and force his company on me
call me two men out of the hall ellen_dean catherine_earnshaw shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian i have humoured her enough
its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion mrs_linton_heathcliff at least was scolding with renewed vigour mr_heathcliff had moved to the window and hung his head somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently
he saw the master first and made a hasty motion that she should be silent which she obeyed abruptly on discovering the reason of his intimation
how is this said mrs_linton_heathcliff addressing her what notion of propriety must you have to remain here after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard
i suppose because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it you are habituated to his baseness and perhaps imagine i can get used to it too
have you been listening at the door mr_edgar asked the mistress in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation
mr_heathcliff who had raised his eye at the former speech gave a sneering laugh at the latter on purpose it seemed to draw mr mrs_linton_heathcliff attention to him
he descended and bidding the servants wait in the passage went followed by me to the kitchen he succeeded but mr_edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion
i ve been so far forbearing with you sir he said quietly not that i was ignorant of your miserable degraded character but i felt you were only partly responsible for that and catherine_earnshaw wishing to keep up your acquaintance i acquiesced foolishly
your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous for that cause and to prevent worse consequences i shall deny you hereafter admission into this house and give notice now that i require your instant departure
three minutes delay will render it involuntary and ignominious mr_heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision
miss_cathy this lamb of yours threatens like a bull he said it is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles
my master glanced towards the passage and signed me to fetch the men he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter
i obeyed the hint but mrs_linton_heathcliff suspecting something followed and when i attempted to call them she pulled me back slammed the door to and locked it
by god mr mrs_linton_heathcliff i mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down fair means she said in answer to her husband look of angry surprise
if you have not courage to attack him make an apology or allow yourself to be beaten it will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess
after constant indulgence of one weak nature and the other bad one i earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude stupid to absurdity
mr_edgar i was defending you and yours and i wish mr_heathcliff may flog you sick for daring to think an evil thought of me
no i ll swallow the key before you shall get it i delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each it did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master
he tried to wrest the key from catherine_earnshaw grasp and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire whereupon mr_edgar was taken with a nervous trembling and his countenance grew deadly pale
for his life he could not avert that excess of emotion mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely he leant on the back of a chair and covered his face
mr_heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice
oh heavens in old days this would win you knighthood exclaimed mrs_linton_heathcliff we are vanquished we are vanquished cheer up
you sha nt be hurt your type is not a lamb it a sucking leveret i wish you joy of the milk blooded coward miss_cathy said her friend
i compliment you on your taste and that is the slavering shivering thing you preferred to me i would not strike him with my fist but i kick him with my foot and experience considerable satisfaction
is he weeping or is he going to faint for fear the fellow approached and gave the chair on which mrs_linton_heathcliff rested a push
he better have kept his distance my master quickly sprang erect and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man
it took his breath for a minute and while he choked mr mrs_linton_heathcliff walked out by the back door into the yard and from thence to the front entrance
there you ve done with coming here cried catherine_earnshaw get away now he ll return with a brace of pistols and half a dozen assistants
if he did overhear us of course he never forgive you you ve played me an ill turn mr_heathcliff but go make haste
i rather see mr_edgar at bay than you do you suppose i going with that blow burning in my gullet he thundered
if i dont floor him now i shall murder him some time so as you value his existence let me get at him
by hell no i ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel nut before i cross the threshold he is not coming i interposed framing a bit of a lie
each has a bludgeon and master will very likely be watching from the parlour window to see that they fulfil his orders
there the coachman and the two gardeners you ll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them the gardeners and coachman were there but mrs_linton_heathcliff was with them
mr_heathcliff on the second thoughts resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings he seized the poker smashed the lock from the inner door and made his escape as they tramped in
she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance and i was anxious to keep her in ignorance
they had already entered the court mrs_linton_heathcliff who was very much excited bade me accompany her up stairs i nearly distracted nelly_dean
tell isabella_linton to shun me this uproar is owing to her and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present i shall get wild
she exclaimed throwing herself on the sofa a thousand smiths hammers are beating in my head and nelly_dean say to mr_edgar if you see him again to night that i in danger of being seriously ill
besides he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings i certain i should recriminate and god knows where we should end
i wish it may prove true he has startled and distressed me shockingly i want to frighten him will you do so my good nelly_dean
mr_heathcliff talk was outrageous after you left us but i could soon have diverted him from isabella_linton and the rest meant nothing
now all is dashed wrong by the fool craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon
you are aware that i am no way blamable in this matter what possessed him to turn listener had mr_edgar never gathered our conversation he would never have been the worse for it
really when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after i had scolded mr_heathcliff till i was hoarse for him i did not care hardly what they did to each other especially as i felt that however the scene closed we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long
well if i cannot keep mr_heathcliff for my friend if mr_edgar will be mean and jealous i ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own
that will be a prompt way of finishing all when i am pushed to extremity but it a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope i not take mrs_linton_heathcliff by surprise with it
to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me you must represent the peril of quitting that policy and remind him of my passionate temper verging when kindled on frenzy
the stolidity with which i received these instructions was no doubt rather exasperating for they were delivered in perfect sincerity but i believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account beforehand might by exerting her will manage to control herself tolerably even while under their influence and i did not wish to frighten her husband as she said and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness
therefore i said nothing when i met the master coming towards the parlour but i took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together
i wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance and look rather more anxious about me he began to speak first
remain where you are catherine_earnshaw he said without any anger in his voice but with much sorrowful despondency i shall not stay
i am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled but i wish just to learn whether after this evening events you intend to continue your intimacy with
oh for mercy sake interrupted the mistress stamping her foot for mercy sake let us hear no more of it now
your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever your veins are full of ice water but mine are boiling and the sight of such chillness makes them dance to get rid of me answer my question persevered mr mrs_linton_heathcliff
you must answer it and that violence does not alarm me i have found that you can be as stoical as anyone when you please
it is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time and i absolutely require to know which you choose
will you give up mr_heathcliff hereafter or will you give up me i require to be let alone exclaimed catherine_earnshaw furiously
i demand it dont you see i can scarcely stand mr_edgar you you leave me she rang the bell till it broke with a twang i entered leisurely
there she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa and grinding her teeth so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters
it was enough to try the temper of a saint such senseless wicked rages mr mrs_linton_heathcliff stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear
he told me to fetch some water she had no breath for speaking i brought a glass full and as she would not drink i sprinkled it on her face
in a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff and turned up her eye while her cheeks at once blanched and livid assumed the aspect of death
mrs_linton_heathcliff looked terrified there is nothing in the world the matter i whispered i did not want him to yield though i could not help being afraid in my heart
she has blood on her lips he said shuddering never mind i answered tartly and i told him how she had resolved previous to his coming on exhibiting a fit of frenzy
i incautiously gave the account aloud and she heard me for she started up her hair flying over her shoulders her eye flashing the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally
i made up my mind for broken bones at least but she only glared about her for an instant and then rushed from the room
the master directed me to follow i did to her chamber door she hindered me from going further by securing it against me
as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning i went to ask whether she would have some carried up
no she replied peremptorily the same question was repeated at dinner and tea and again on the morrow after and received the same answer
isabella_linton and he had had an hour interview during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for mr_heathcliff advances but he could make nothing of her evasive replies and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily adding however a solemn warning that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff on his part spent his time in the library and did not inquire concerning his wife occupation chapter xii
while miss mrs_linton_heathcliff moped about the park and garden always silent and almost always in tears and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened wearying i guessed with a continual vague expectation that catherine_earnshaw repenting her conduct would come of her own accord to ask pardon and seek a reconciliation and she fasted pertinaciously under the idea probably that at every meal mr_edgar was ready to choke for her absence and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet
i went about my household duties convinced that the grange had but one sensible soul in its walls and that lodged in my body
i wasted no condolences on miss nor any expostulations on my mistress nor did i pay much attention to the sighs of my master who yearned to hear his lady name since he might not hear her voice
i determined they should come about as they pleased for me and though it was a tiresomely slow process i began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress as i thought at first
mrs_linton_heathcliff on the third day unbarred her door and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter desired a renewed supply and a basin of gruel for she believed she was dying
that i set down as a speech meant for mr_edgar ears i believed no such thing so i kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast
she ate and drank eagerly and sank back on her pillow again clenching her hand and groaning oh i will die she exclaimed since no one cares anything about me
then a good while after i heard her murmur no i ll not die he be glad he does not love me at all he would never miss me
i wish i had not taken that did you want anything ma am i inquired still preserving my external composure in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange exaggerated manner
what is that apathetic being doing she demanded pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face has he fallen into a lethargy or is he dead
i think though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought he is continually among his books since he has no other society
i should not have spoken so if i had known her true condition but i could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder
neither replied i if you mean mr mrs_linton_heathcliff he tolerably well among his books she cried confounded and i dying
my god does he know how i altered continued she staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall
i on the brink of the grave is that catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff he imagines me in a pet in play perhaps cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest
nelly_dean if it be not too late as soon as i learn how he feels i ll choose between these two either to starve at once that would be no punishment unless he had a heart or to recover and leave the country
why ma am i answered the master has no idea of your being deranged and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger
are you speaking the truth about him now take care is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life you think not
cannot you tell him i will she returned persuade him speak of your own mind say you are certain i will
no you forget mrs_linton_heathcliff i suggested that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening and to morrow you will perceive its good effects
if i were only sure it would kill him she interrupted i kill myself directly these three awful nights i ve never closed my lids and oh i ve been tormented
i ve been haunted nelly_dean but i begin to fancy you dont like me how strange i thought though everybody hated and despised each other they could not avoid loving me
and they have all turned to enemies in a few hours they have i positive the people here how dreary to meet death surrounded by their cold faces
and mr_edgar standing solemnly by to see it over then offering prayers of thanks to god for restoring peace to his house and going back to his books
isabella_linton terrified and repelled afraid to enter the room it would be so dreadful to watch catherine_earnshaw go what in the name of all that feels has he to do with books when i am dying
tossing about she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness and tore the pillow with her teeth then raising herself up all burning desired that i would open the window
she could not bear the notion which i had put into her head of mr mrs_linton_heathcliff philosophical resignation we were in the middle of winter the wind blew strong from the north east and i objected
both the expressions flitting over her face and the changes of her moods began to alarm me terribly and brought to my recollection her former illness and the doctor injunction that she should not be crossed
a minute previously she was violent now supported on one arm and not noticing my refusal to obey her she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species her mind had strayed to other associations
that a turkey she murmured to herself and this is a wild duck and this is a pigeon ah they put pigeons feathers in the pillows
no wonder i couldnt die let me take care to throw it on the floor when i lie down and here is a moor cock and this
i should know it among a thousand it a lapwing bonny bird wheeling over our head in the middle of the moor
this feather was picked up from the heath the bird was not shot we saw its nest in the winter full of little skeletons
it wanted to get to its nest for the clouds had touched the swells and it felt rain coming mr_heathcliff set a trap over it and the old ones dared not come
i made him promise he never shoot a lapwing after that and he didnt yes here are more did he shoot my lapwings nelly_dean
i interrupted dragging the pillow away and turning the holes towards the mattress for she was removing its contents by handfuls
are they red any of them let me look give over with that baby work lie down and shut your eye you re wandering
there a mess the down is flying about like snow i went here and there collecting it i see in you nelly_dean she continued dreamily an aged woman you have grey hair and bent shoulders
this bed is the fairy cave under penistone crags and you are gathering elf bolts to hurt our heifers pretending while i am near that they are only locks of wool
i not wandering you re mistaken or else i should believe you really were that withered hag and i should think i was under penistone crags and i conscious
that what you ll come to fifty year hence i know you are not so now it night and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet
the black press where is that i asked you are talking in your sleep it against the wall as it always is she replied
there no press in the room and never was said i resuming my seat and looping up the curtain that i might watch her
it does appear odd i see a face in it dont you see that face she inquired gazing earnestly at the mirror
and say what i could i was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own so i rose and covered it with a shawl
it behind there still she pursued anxiously and it stirred who is it i hope it will not come out when you are gone
i took her hand in mine and bid her be composed for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame and she would keep straining her gaze towards the glass
oh nelly_dean the room is haunted i afraid of being alone there nobody here i insisted it was yourself mrs_linton_heathcliff you knew it a while since
myself she gasped and the clock is striking twelve it true then that dreadful her fingers clutched the clothes and gathered them over her eye
i attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband but i was summoned back by a piercing shriek the shawl had dropped from the frame
that is the glass the mirror mrs_linton_heathcliff and you see yourself in it and there am i too by your side
trembling and bewildered she held me fast but the horror gradually passed from her countenance its paleness gave place to a glow of shame
why what is the matter cried i who is coward now wake up oh dear i thought i was at home she sighed
i thought i was lying in my chamber at wuthering heights because i weak my brain got confused and i screamed unconsciously
a sound sleep would do you good ma am i answered and i hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again
dont say anything but stay with me i dread sleeping my dreams appal me oh if i were but in my own bed in the old house
she went on bitterly wringing her hand and that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice do let me feel it
it comes straight down the moor do let me have one breath to pacify her i held the casement ajar a few seconds
a cold blast rushed through i closed it and returned to my post she lay still now her face bathed in tears
exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit our fiery catherine_earnshaw was no better than a wailing child how long is it since i shut myself in here
she asked suddenly reviving it was monday evening i replied and this is thursday night or rather friday morning at present
what of the same week she exclaimed only that brief time long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill temper observed i
i remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled and mr_edgar being cruelly provoking and me running into this room desperate
well it seems a weary number of hours she muttered doubtfully it must be more as soon as ever i had barred the door utter blackness overwhelmed me and i fell on the floor
i couldnt explain to mr_edgar how certain i felt of having a fit or going raging mad if he persisted in teasing me
i had no command of tongue or brain and he did not guess my agony perhaps it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice
before i recovered sufficiently to see and hear it began to be dawn and nelly_dean i ll tell you what i thought and what has kept recurring and recurring till i feared for my reason
i thought as i lay there with my head against that table leg and my eye dimly discerning the grey square of the window that i was enclosed in the oak panelled bed at home and my heart ached with some great grief which just waking i could not recollect
i pondered and worried myself to discover what it could be and most strangely the whole last seven year of my life grew a blank
i was a child my father was just buried and my misery arose from the separation that mr_hindley had ordered between me and mr_heathcliff
i was laid alone for the first time and rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping i lifted my hand to push the panels aside it struck the table top
i swept it along the carpet and then memory burst in my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair
i did not recall that they had been at all i cannot say why i felt so wildly wretched it must have been temporary derangement for there is scarcely cause
but supposing at twelve year old i had been wrenched from the heights and every early association and my all in all as mr_heathcliff was at that time and been converted at a stroke into mrs_linton_heathcliff the lady of thrushcross_grange and the wife of a stranger an exile and outcast thenceforth from what had been my world
you may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where i grovelled shake your head as you will nelly_dean you have helped to unsettle me
you should have spoken to mr_edgar indeed you should and compelled him to leave me quiet oh i burning i wish i were out of door
i wish i were a girl again half savage and hardy and free and laughing at injuries not maddening under them
why am i so changed why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few word i sure i should be myself
were i once among the heather on those hills open the window again wide fasten it open quick why dont you move
because i wont give you your death of cold i answered you wont give me a chance of life you mean she said sullenly
and sliding from the bed before i could hinder her she crossed the room walking very uncertainly threw it back and bent out careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife
but i soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine she was delirious i became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings
there was no moon and everything beneath lay in misty darkness not a light gleamed from any house far or near all had been extinguished long ago and those at wuthering heights were never visible still she asserted she caught their shining
she cried eagerly that my room with the candle in it and the trees swaying before it and the other candle is in joseph garret
however i not helpless yet i ll open it myself i entreated and finally attempted to force her to retire look joseph sits up late doesnt he
it a rough journey and a sad heart to travel it and we must pass by gimmerton_kirk to go that journey
he waiting till i come home that he may lock the gate well he ll wait a while yet we ve braved its ghosts often together and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come
i ll not lie there by myself they may bury me twelve feet deep and throw the church down over me but i wont rest till you are with me
but mr_heathcliff if i dare you now will you venture if you do i ll keep you i never will she paused and resumed with a strange smile
he considering he rather i come to him find a way then not through that kirkyard you are slow be content you always followed me
perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity i was planning how i could reach something to wrap about her without quitting my hold of herself for i could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice when to my consternation i heard the rattle of the door handle and mr mrs_linton_heathcliff entered
he had only then come from the library and in passing through the lobby had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity or fear to examine what it signified at that late hour
i cried checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber
oh sir my poor mistress is ill and she quite master me i cannot manage her at all pray come and persuade her to go to bed
forget your anger for she hard to guide any way but her own catherine_earnshaw ill he said hastening to us
the haggardness of mrs_linton_heathcliff appearance smote him speechless and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment
she been fretting here i continued and eating scarcely anything and never complaining she would admit none of us till this evening and so we couldnt inform you of her state as we were not aware of it ourselves but it is nothing
shut the window ellen_dean catherine_earnshaw why he was silent i felt i uttered my explanations awkwardly the master frowned it is nothing is it ellen_dean
he said sternly you shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this and he took his wife in his arms and looked at her with anguish
the delirium was not fixed however having weaned her eye from contemplating the outer darkness by degrees she centred her attention on him and discovered who it was that held her
at first she gave him no glance of recognition he was invisible to her abstracted gaze ah you are come are you mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff
she said with angry animation you are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted and when you are wanted never
i suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations now i see we shall but they cant keep me from my narrow home out yonder
there it is not among the lintons mind under the chapel roof but in the open air with a head stone and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me
my resting place where i bound before spring is over catherine_earnshaw what have you done commenced the master am i nothing to you any more
do you love that wretch heath hush cried mrs_linton_heathcliff hush this moment you mention that name and i end the matter instantly by a spring from the window
what you touch at present you may have but my soul will be on that hill top before you lay hand on me again
i dont want you mr_edgar i past wanting you return to your books i glad you possess a consolation for all you had in me is gone
her mind wanders sir i interposed she has been talking nonsense the whole evening but let her have quiet and proper attendance and she ll rally
hereafter we must be cautious how we vex her i desire no further advice from you answered mr mrs_linton_heathcliff
you knew your mistress nature and you encouraged me to harass her and not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days
it was heartless months of sickness could not cause such a change i began to defend myself thinking it too bad to be blamed for another wicked waywardness
i knew mrs_linton_heathcliff nature to be headstrong and domineering cried i but i didnt know that you wished to foster her fierce temper
i didnt know that to humour her i should wink at mr_heathcliff i performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you and i have got a faithful servant wages
well it will teach me to be careful next time next time you may gather intelligence for yourself the next time you bring a tale to me
you rather hear nothing about it i suppose then mr mrs_linton_heathcliff said i mr_heathcliff has your permission to come a courting to miss and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers on purpose to poison the mistress against you
you shall quit my service ellen_dean he replied confused as catherine_earnshaw was her wits were alert at applying our conversation
ah nelly_dean has played traitor she exclaimed passionately nelly_dean is my hidden enemy you witch so you do seek elf bolts to hurt us
let me go and i ll make her rue i ll make her howl a recantation a maniac fury kindled under her brow she struggled desperately to disengage herself from mrs_linton_heathcliff arms
i felt no inclination to tarry the event and resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility i quitted the chamber
in passing the garden to reach the road at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall i saw something white moved irregularly evidently by another agent than the wind
notwithstanding my hurry i stayed to examine it lest ever after i should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world
my surprise and perplexity were great on discovering by touch more than vision miss isabella_linton springer fanny suspended by a handkerchief and nearly at its last gasp
i had seen it follow its mistress up stairs when she went to bed and wondered much how it could have got out there and what mischievous person had treated it so
while untying the knot round the hook it seemed to me that i repeatedly caught the beat of horses feet galloping at some distance but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that i hardly gave the circumstance a thought though it was a strange sound in that place at two clock in the morning
mr_kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as i came up the street and my account of catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff malady induced him to accompany me back immediately
he was a plain rough man and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before
i quickly released the animal and lifted it into the garden nelly_dean ellen_dean said he i cant help fancying there an extra cause for this
a stout hearty lass like catherine_earnshaw does not fall ill for a trifle and that sort of people should not either
what has there been to do at the grange we ve odd reports up here it hard work bringing them through fevers and such things
the master will inform you i answered but you are acquainted with the earnshaws violent dispositions and mrs_linton_heathcliff caps them all
how did it begin i may say this it commenced in a quarrel she was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit
afterwards she refused to eat and now she alternately raves and remains in a half dream knowing those about her but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions
that her account at least for she flew off in the height of it and locked herself up mr mrs_linton_heathcliff will be sorry observed mr_kenneth interrogatively
sorry he ll break his heart should anything happen i replied dont alarm him more than necessary well i told him to beware said my companion and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning
mr_heathcliff frequently visits at the grange answered i though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy than because the master likes his company
hasnt he been intimate with mr_heathcliff lately at present he discharged from the trouble of calling owing to some presumptuous aspirations after miss mrs_linton_heathcliff which he manifested
i hardly think he ll be taken in again and does miss mrs_linton_heathcliff turn a cold shoulder on him was the doctor next question
i not in her confidence returned i reluctant to continue the subject no she a sly one he remarked shaking his head
she keeps her own counsel but she a real little fool i have it from good authority that last night and a pretty night it was
she and mr_heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours and he pressed her not to go in again but just mount his horse and away with him
my informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that when it was to be he didnt hear but you urge mr mrs_linton_heathcliff to look sharp
this news filled me with fresh fears i outstripped mr_kenneth and ran most of the way back the little dog was yelping in the garden yet
i spared a minute to open the gate for it but instead of going to the house door it coursed up and down snuffing the grass and would have escaped to the road had i not seized it and conveyed it in with me
on ascending to isabella_linton room my suspicions were confirmed it was empty had i been a few hours sooner mrs_linton_heathcliff illness might have arrested her rash step
i could not pursue them however and i dared not rouse the family and fill the place with confusion still less unfold the business to my master absorbed as he was in his present calamity and having no heart to spare for a second grief
i saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue and suffer matters to take their course and mr_kenneth being arrived i went with a badly composed countenance to announce him
catherine_earnshaw lay in a troubled sleep her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy he now hung over her pillow watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features
the doctor on examining the case for himself spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity
but what could be done now there was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly to me he signified the threatening danger was not so much death as permanent alienation of intellect
indeed we never went to bed and the servants were all up long before the usual hour moving through the house with stealthy tread and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations
every one was active but miss isabella_linton and they began to remark how sound she slept her brother too asked if she had risen and seemed impatient for her presence and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister in law
i trembled lest he should send me to call her but i was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight
one of the maids a thoughtless girl who had been on an early errand to gimmerton_kirk came panting up stairs open mouthed and dashed into the chamber crying oh dear dear
i did not close my eye that night nor did mr mrs_linton_heathcliff what mun we have next master master our young lady hold your noise
cried i hastily enraged at her clamorous manner speak lower mary what is the matter said mr mrs_linton_heathcliff what ails your young lady
she gone she gone yon mr_heathcliff run off wi her gasped the girl that is not true exclaimed mrs_linton_heathcliff rising in agitation
it cannot be how has the idea entered your head ellen_dean go and seek her it is incredible it cannot be
as he spoke he took the servant to the door and then repeated his demand to know her reason for such an assertion
why i met on the road a lad that fetches milk here she stammered and he asked whether we werent in trouble at the grange
i thought he meant for missis sickness so i answered yes then says he there somebody gone after em i guess
he saw i knew nought about it and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse shoe fastened at a blacksmith shop two mile out of gimmerton_kirk not very long after midnight and how the blacksmith lass had got up to spy who they were she knew them both directly
i stared and she noticed the man mr_heathcliff it was she felt certain nob dy could mistake him besides put a sovereign in her father hand for payment
the lady had a cloak about her face but having desired a sup of water while she drank it fell back and she saw her very plain
mr_heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on and they set their faces from the village and went as fast as the rough roads would let them
the lass said nothing to her father but she told it all over gimmerton_kirk this morning i ran and peeped for form sake into isabella_linton room confirming when i returned the servant statement
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff had resumed his seat by the bed on my re entrance he raised his eye read the meaning of my blank aspect and dropped them without giving an order or uttering a word
are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back i inquired how should we do she went of her own accord answered the master she had a right to go if she pleased
trouble me no more about her hereafter she is only my sister in name not because i disown her but because she has disowned me
and that was all he said on the subject he did not make single inquiry further or mention her in any way except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home wherever it was when i knew it
for two months the fugitives remained absent in those two months mrs_linton_heathcliff encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever
day and night he was watching and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict and though mr_kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety in fact that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when catherine_earnshaw life was declared out of danger and hour after hour he would sit beside her tracing the gradual return to bodily health and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also and she would soon be entirely her former self
chapter xiii no mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than mr_edgar tended her the first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following march
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff had put on her pillow in the morning a handful of golden crocuses her eye long stranger to any gleam of pleasure caught them in waking and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together
these are the earliest flowers at the heights she exclaimed they remind me of soft thaw winds and warm sunshine and nearly melted snow
the snow is quite gone down here darling replied her husband and i only see two white spots on the whole range of moors
mr_edgar is there not a south wind and is not the snow almost gone the sky is blue and the larks are singing and the becks and brooks are all brim full
catherine_earnshaw last spring at this time i was longing to have you under this roof now i wish you were a mile or two up those hills the air blows so sweetly i feel that it would cure you
i shall never be there but once more said the invalid and then you ll leave me and i shall remain for ever
next spring you ll long again to have me under this roof and you ll look back and think you were happy to day
mrs_linton_heathcliff lavished on her the kindest caresses and tried to cheer her by the fondest word but vaguely regarding the flowers she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding
we knew she was really better and therefore decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency and it might be partially removed by a change of scene
the master told me to light a fire in the many weeks deserted parlour and to set an easy chair in the sunshine by the window and then he brought her down and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat and as we expected revived by the objects round her which though familiar were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber
by evening she seemed greatly exhausted yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment and i had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed till another room could be prepared
to obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs we fitted up this where you lie at present on the same floor with the parlour and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other leaning on mr_edgar arm
ah i thought myself she might recover so waited on as she was and there was double cause to desire it for on her existence
depended that of another we cherished the hope that in a little while mr mrs_linton_heathcliff heart would be gladdened and his lands secured from a stranger grip by the birth of an heir
i should mention that isabella_linton sent to her brother some six weeks from her departure a short note announcing her marriage with mr_heathcliff
it appeared dry and cold but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation if her proceeding had offended him asserting that she could not help it then and being done she had now no power to repeal it
mrs_linton_heathcliff did not reply to this i believe and in a fortnight more i got a long letter which i considered odd coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon
i ll read it for i keep it yet any relic of the dead is precious if they were valued living
dear ellen_dean it begins i came last night to wuthering heights and heard for the first time that catherine_earnshaw has been and is yet very ill
i must not write to her i suppose and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what i sent him
inform mr_edgar that i give the world to see his face again that my heart returned to thrushcross_grange in twenty four hours after i left it and is there at this moment full of warm feelings for him and catherine_earnshaw
i cant follow it though these word are underlined they need not expect me and they may draw what conclusions they please taking care however to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection
still i must write to somebody and the only choice left me is you the remainder of the letter is for yourself alone
i want to ask you two questions the first is how did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here
i cannot recognise any sentiment which those around share with me the second question i have great interest in it is this is mr_heathcliff a man
i sha nt tell my reason for making this inquiry but i beseech you to explain if you can what i have married that is when you call to see me and you must call ellen_dean very soon
if so is he mad and if not is he a devil dont write but come and bring me something from mr_edgar
now you shall hear how i have been received in my new home as i am led to imagine the heights will be
it is to amuse myself that i dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts they never occupy my thoughts except at the moment when i miss them
i should laugh and dance for joy if i found their absence was the total of my miseries and the rest was an unnatural dream
the sun set behind the grange as we turned on to the moors by that i judged it to be six clock and my companion halted half an hour to inspect the park and the garden and probably the place itself as well as he could so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farm house and your old fellow servant joseph issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle
his first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face squint malignantly project his under lip and turn away
then he took the two horses and led them into the stables reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate as if we lived in an ancient castle
mr_heathcliff stayed to speak to him and i entered the kitchen a dingy untidy hole i daresay you would not know it it is so changed since it was in your charge
by the fire stood a ruffianly child strong in limb and dirty in garb with a look of catherine_earnshaw in his eye and about his mouth
he did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit this is mr_edgar legal nephew i reflected mine in a manner i must shake hand and yes i must kiss him
it is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning i approached and attempting to take his chubby fist said how do you do my dear
he replied in a jargon i did not comprehend shall you and i be friends hareton_earnshaw was my next essay at conversation
an oath and a threat to set throttler on me if i did not frame off rewarded my perseverance hey throttler lad
whispered the little wretch rousing a half bred bull dog from its lair in a corner now wilt thou be ganging he asked authoritatively
mr_heathcliff was nowhere visible and joseph whom i followed to the stables and requested to accompany me in after staring and muttering to himself screwed up his nose and replied mim
love for my life urged a compliance i stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter mim mim
did iver christian body hear aught like it mincing un munching how can i tell whet ye say i say i wish you to come with me into the house
i getten summut else to do he answered and continued his work moving his lantern jaws meanwhile and surveying my dress and countenance the former a great deal too fine but the latter i sure as sad as he could desire with sovereign contempt
i walked round the yard and through a wicket to another door at which i took the liberty of knocking in hopes some more civil servant might show himself
after a short suspense it was opened by a tall gaunt man without neckerchief and otherwise extremely slovenly his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders and his eye too were like a ghostly catherine_earnshaw with all their beauty annihilated
i cried thinking him deaf yet highly disgusted at his rudeness none me what your business here he demanded grimly
who are you my name was isabella_linton mrs_linton_heathcliff i replied you ve seen me before sir i lately married to mr_heathcliff and he has brought me here i suppose by your permission
is he come back then asked the hermit glaring like a hungry wolf yes we came just now i said
but he left me by the kitchen door and when i would have gone in your little boy played sentinel over the place and frightened me off by the help of a bull dog
it well the hellish villain has kept his word growled my future host searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering mr_heathcliff and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations and threats of what he would have done had the fiend deceived him
i repented having tried this second entrance and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing but ere i could execute that intention he ordered me in and shut and re fastened the door
there was a great fire and that was all the light in the huge apartment whose floor had grown a uniform grey and the once brilliant pewter dishes which used to attract my gaze when i was a girl partook of a similar obscurity created by tarnish and dust
he walked up and down with his hand in his pockets apparently quite forgetting my presence and his abstraction was evidently so deep and his whole aspect so misanthropical that i shrank from disturbing him again
you ll not be surprised ellen_dean at my feeling particularly cheerless seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth and remembering that four mile distant lay my delightful home containing the only people i loved on earth and there might as well be the atlantic to part us instead of those four mile i could not overpass them
i inquired whether i might call the maid and be conducted to a bedroom mr catherine_earnshaw vouchsafed no answer i questioned with myself where must i turn for comfort
and mind you dont tell mr_edgar or catherine_earnshaw above every sorrow beside this rose pre eminent despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against mr_heathcliff
i had sought shelter at wuthering heights almost gladly because i was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him but he knew the people we were coming amongst and he did not fear their intermeddling
the clock struck eight and nine and still my companion paced to and fro his head bent on his breast and perfectly silent unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals
i listened to detect a woman voice in the house and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations which at last spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping
i was not aware how openly i grieved till catherine_earnshaw halted opposite in his measured walk and gave me a stare of newly awakened surprise
i sat and thought a doleful time taking advantage of his recovered attention i exclaimed i tired with my journey and i want to go to bed
where is the maid servant direct me to her as she wont come to me we have none he answered you must wait on yourself
where must i sleep then i sobbed i was beyond regarding self respect weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness joseph will show you mr_heathcliff chamber said he open that door he in there
i was going to obey but he suddenly arrested me and added in the strangest tone be so good as to turn your lock and draw your bolt dont omit it
well i said but why mr catherine_earnshaw i did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with mr_heathcliff
look here he replied pulling from his waistcoat a curiously constructed pistol having a double edged spring knife attached to the barrel
that a great tempter to a desperate man is it not i cannot resist going up with this every night and trying his door
if once i find it open he done for i do it invariably even though the minute before i have been recalling a hundred reason that should make me refrain it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him
you fight against that devil for love as long as you may when the time comes not all the angels in heaven shall save him
i surveyed the weapon inquisitively a hideous notion struck me how powerful i should be possessing such an instrument i took it from his hand and touched the blade
he looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second it was not horror it was covetousness he snatched the pistol back jealously shut the knife and returned it to its concealment
i dont care if you tell him said he put him on his guard and watch for him you know the terms we are on i see his danger does not shock you
what has mr_heathcliff done to you i asked in what has he wronged you to warrant this appalling hatred wouldnt it be wiser to bid him quit the house
no thundered catherine_earnshaw should he offer to leave me he a dead man persuade him to attempt it and you are a murderess
i will have it back and i ll have his gold too and then his blood and hell shall have his soul
am i to lose all without a chance of retrieval is hareton_earnshaw to be a beggar oh damnation it will be ten time blacker with that guest than ever it was before
you ve acquainted me ellen_dean with your old master habits he is clearly on the verge of madness he was so last night at least
i shuddered to be near him and thought on the servant ill bred moroseness as comparatively agreeable he now recommenced his moody walk and i raised the latch and escaped into the kitchen
joseph was bending over the fire peering into a large pan that swung above it and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by
the contents of the pan began to boil and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl i conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper and being hungry i resolved it should be eatable so crying out sharply i ll make the porridge
i removed the vessel out of his reach and proceeded to take off my hat and riding habit mr catherine_earnshaw i continued directs me to wait on myself i will
i not going to act the lady among you for fear i should starve gooid lord he muttered sitting down and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle
if there to be fresh ortherings just when i getten used to two maisters if i mun hev a mistress set er my heead
i niver did think to seet day that i mud lave th owld place but i doubt it nigh at hand
this lamentation drew no notice from me i went briskly to work sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance
there was of conjuring up its apparition the quicker the thible ran round and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water
it like time to be flitting it racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation
thear he ejaculated hareton_earnshaw thou willnt sup thy porridge to neeght they ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive
thear agean i fling in bowl un all if i wer ye there palet guilp off un then ye ll hae done wit bang bang
it was rather a rough mess i own when poured into the basins four had been provided and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy which hareton_earnshaw seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip
i expostulated and desired that he should have his in a mug affirming that i could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily
the old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety assuring me repeatedly that the barn was every bit as good as i and every bit as wollsome and wondering how i could fashion to be so conceited
it a mercyt bothom isnt deaved out meanwhile the infant ruffian continued sucking and glowered up at me defyingly as he slavered into the jug
i shall have my supper in another room i said have you no place you call a parlour parlour
he echoed sneeringly parlour nay we ve noa parlours if yah dunnut loike wer company there maister un if yah dunnut loike maister there us
then i shall go up stairs i answered show me a chamber i put my basin on a tray and went myself to fetch some more milk
with great grumblings the fellow rose and preceded me in my ascent we mounted to the garrets he opened a door now and then to look into the apartment we passed
here a rahm he said at last flinging back a cranky board on hinges it weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in
there a pack corn it corner thear meeterly clane if ye re feared muckying yer grand silk cloes spread yer hankerchir
the rahm was a kind of lumber hole smelling strong of malt and grain various sacks of which articles were piled around leaving a wide bare space in the middle
ot top ont why man i exclaimed facing him angrily this is not a place to sleep in i wish to see my bed room
he pointed into the second garret only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls and having a large low curtainless bed with an indigo coloured quilt at one end
bed rume he repeated in a tone of mockery yah see allt bed rumes thear is yon mine what do i want with yours
i retorted i suppose mr_heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house does he oh it maister hathecliff ye re wanting
cried he as if making a new discovery couldnt ye ha said soa at onst un then i mud ha telled ye baht all this wark that that just one ye cannut see
you ve a nice house joseph i could not refrain from observing and pleasant inmates and i think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day i linked my fate with theirs
he allas keeps it locked un nob dy iver mells ont but hisseln however that is not to the present purpose there are other rooms
he made no reply to this adjuration only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps and halting before an apartment which from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture i conjectured to be the best one
there was a carpet a good one but the pattern was obliterated by dust a fireplace hung with cut paper dropping to pieces
a handsome oak bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make but they had evidently experienced rough usage the vallances hung in festoons wrenched from their rings and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side causing the drapery to trail upon the floor
for heaven sake be quick and let me settle somewhere the chairs were also damaged many of them severely and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls
i was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession when my fool of a guide announced this here ist maister
my supper by this time was cold my appetite gone and my patience exhausted i insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge and means of repose
whear the divil began the religious elder the lord bless us the lord forgie us whear the hell wold ye gang
ye marred wearisome nowt ye ve seen all but hareton_earnshaw bit of a cham er there not another hoile to lig down in i th hahse
i was so vexed i flung my tray and its contents on the ground and then seated myself at the stairs head hid my face in my hand and cried
howsivert maister sall just tum le er them brooken pots un then we hear summut we hear how it to be
ech ech exclaimed joseph weel done miss_cathy weel done miss_cathy gooid for naught madling ye desarve pining fro this to chrustmas flingingt precious gifts god under fooit
i yer flaysome rages but i mista en if ye shew yer sperrit lang will hathecliff bide sich bonny ways think ye
and so he went on scolding to his den beneath taking the candle with him and i remained in the dark
the period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath and bestirring myself to remove its effects
an unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of throttler whom i now recognised as a son of our old skulker it had spent its whelphood at the grange and was given by my father to mr_hindley
it knew me it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute and then hastened to devour the porridge while i groped from step to step collecting the shattered earthenware and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket handkerchief
our labours were scarcely over when i heard catherine_earnshaw tread in the passage my assistant tucked in his tail and pressed to the wall i stole into the nearest doorway
i nobbut wish he may catch ye i that plisky i nobbut wish he may i fancy the dog endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful as i guessed by a scutter down stairs and a prolonged piteous yelping
i had better luck he passed on entered his chamber and shut the door directly after joseph came up with hareton_earnshaw to put him to bed
i had found shelter in hareton_earnshaw room and the old man on seeing me said they rahm for boath ye un yer pride now i sud think i the hahse
gladly did i take advantage of this intimation and the minute i flung myself into a chair by the fire i nodded and slept
it empty ye may hev it all to yerseln un him as allus maks a third i sich ill company my slumber was deep and sweet though over far too soon
i told him the cause of my staying up so late that he had the key of our room in his pocket
mr_heathcliff awoke me he had just come in and demanded in his loving manner what i was doing there the adjective our gave mortal offence
but i ll not repeat his language nor describe his habitual conduct he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence
he swore it was not nor ever should be mine and he i sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear
yet i assure you a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens
he told me of catherine_earnshaw illness and accused my brother of causing it promising that i should be mr_edgar proxy in suffering till he could get hold of him
i do hate him i am wretched i have been a fool beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at the grange
as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master and informed him that his sister had arrived at the heights and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for mrs_linton_heathcliff situation and her ardent desire to see him with a wish that he would transmit to her as early as possible some token of forgiveness by me
i shall expect you every day dont disappoint me isabella_linton chapter xiv forgiveness said mrs_linton_heathcliff i have nothing to forgive her ellen_dean
you may call at wuthering heights this afternoon if you like and say that i am not angry but i sorry to have lost her especially as i can never think she ll be happy
it is out of the question my going to see her however we are eternally divided and should she really wish to oblige me let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country
and you wont write her a little note sir i asked imploringly no he answered it is needless my communication with mr_heathcliff family shall be as sparing as his with mine
i puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said when i repeated it and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console isabella_linton
i daresay she had been on the watch for me since morning i saw her looking through the lattice as i came up the garden causeway and i nodded to her but she drew back as if afraid of being observed
it shall not exist mr_edgar coldness depressed me exceedingly and all the way from the grange i entered without knocking
i must confess that if i had been in the young lady place i would at least have swept the hearth and wiped the tables with a duster
there never was such a dreary dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented but she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her
her pretty face was wan and listless her hair uncurled some locks hanging lankly down and some carelessly twisted round her head
mr_heathcliff sat at a table turning over some papers in his pocket book but he rose when i appeared asked me how i did quite friendly and offered me a chair
probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening mr_hindley was not there he was the only thing there that seemed decent and i thought he never looked better
so much had circumstances altered their positions that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman and his wife as a thorough little slattern
she came forward eagerly to greet me and held out one hand to take the expected letter i shook my head
she wouldnt understand the hint but followed me to a sideboard where i went to lay my bonnet and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what i had brought
mr_heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres and said if you have got anything for isabella_linton as no doubt you have nelly_dean give it to her
you neednt make a secret of it we have no secrets between us oh i have nothing i replied thinking it best to speak the truth at once
my master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present
he sends his love ma am and his wishes for your happiness and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication as nothing could come of keeping it up
mrs mr_heathcliff lip quivered slightly and she returned to her seat in the window her husband took his stand on the hearthstone near me and began to put questions concerning catherine_earnshaw
i told him as much as i thought proper of her illness and he extorted from me by cross examination most of the facts connected with its origin
i blamed her as she deserved for bringing it all on herself and ended by hoping that he would follow mr mrs_linton_heathcliff example and avoid future interference with his family for good or evil
mrs_linton_heathcliff is now just recovering i said she ll never be like she was but her life is spared and if you really have a regard for her you ll shun crossing her way again nay you ll move out of this country entirely and that you may not regret it i ll inform you catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff is as different now from your old friend catherine_earnshaw as that young lady is different from me
her appearance is changed greatly her character much more so and the person who is compelled of necessity to be her companion will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was by common humanity and a sense of duty
that is quite possible remarked mr_heathcliff forcing himself to seem calm quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon
but do you imagine that i shall leave catherine_earnshaw to his duty and humanity and can you compare my feelings respecting catherine_earnshaw to his
before you leave this house i must exact a promise from you that you ll get me an interview with her consent or refuse i will see her
what do you say i say mr_heathcliff i replied you must not you never shall through my means another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether
with your aid that may be avoided he continued and should there be danger of such an event should he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her existence
i wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether catherine_earnshaw would suffer greatly from his loss the fear that she would restrains me
why i think i shall be justified in going to extremes and there you see the distinction between our feelings had he been in my place and
i in his though i hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall i never would have raised a hand against him
you may look incredulous if you please i never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his
but till then if you dont believe me you dont know me till then i would have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head
and yet i interrupted you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now when she has nearly forgotten you and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress
the moment her regard ceased i would have torn his heart out and drunk his blood you suppose she has nearly forgotten me
he said oh nelly_dean you know she has not you know as well as i do that for every thought she spends on mrs_linton_heathcliff
at a most miserable period of my life i had a notion of the kind it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again
she spends a thousand on me and then mrs_linton_heathcliff would be nothing nor mr_hindley nor all the dreams that ever i dreamt
two word would comprehend my future death and hell existence after losing her would be hell yet i was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff attachment more than mine
if he loved with all the powers of his puny being he couldnt love as much in eighty year as i could in a day
and catherine_earnshaw has a heart as deep as i have the sea could be as readily contained in that horse trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him
it is not in him to be loved like me how can she love in him what he has not
catherine_earnshaw and mr_edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be cried isabella_linton with sudden vivacity
tush he is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog or her horse no one has a right to talk in that manner and i wont hear my brother depreciated in silence
your brother is wondrous fond of you too isnt he observed mr_heathcliff scornfully he turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity
he is not aware of what i suffer she replied i didnt tell him that you have been telling him something then you have written have you
to say that i was married i did write you saw the note and nothing since no my young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition i remarked
somebody love comes short in her case obviously whose i may guess but perhaps i shouldnt say i should guess it was her own said mr_heathcliff
she degenerates into a mere slut she is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early you hardly credit it but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home
however she ll suit this house so much the better for not being over nice and i ll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad
i hope you ll consider that mrs mr_heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on and that she has been brought up like an only daughter whom every one was ready to serve
well sir returned i you must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her and you must treat her kindly
whatever be your notion of mr_edgar you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments or she wouldnt have abandoned the elegancies and comforts and friends of her former home to fix contentedly in such a wilderness as this with you
she abandoned them under a delusion he answered picturing in me a hero of romance and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion
i can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished
i dont perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first and the senseless incapability of discerning that i was in earnest when i gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself
but at last i think she begins to know me it was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that i did not love her
and yet it is poorly learnt for this morning she announced as a piece of appalling intelligence that i had actually succeeded in making her hate me
i believed at one time no lessons could teach her that a positive labour of hercules i assure you if it be achieved i have cause to return thanks
can i trust your assertion isabella_linton are you sure you hate me if i let you alone for half a day wont you come sighing and wheedling to me again
i daresay she would rather i had seemed all tenderness before you it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed
but i dont care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side and i never told her a lie about it
the first thing she saw me do on coming out of the grange was to hang up her little dog and when she pleaded for it the first word i uttered were a wish that i had the hanging of every being belonging to her except one possibly she took that exception for herself
but no brutality disgusted her i suppose she has an innate admiration of it if only her precious person were secure from injury
now was it not the depth of absurdity of genuine idiotcy for that pitiful slavish mean minded brach to dream that i could love her
she cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness tell your master nelly_dean that i never in all my life met with such an abject thing as she is
she even disgraces the name of mrs_linton_heathcliff and i ve sometimes relented from pure lack of invention in my experiments on what she could endure and still creep shamefully cringing back
but tell him also to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease that i keep strictly within the limits of the law
i have avoided up to this period giving her the slightest right to claim a separation and what more she thank nobody for dividing us
if she desired to go she might the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her
mr_heathcliff said i this is the talk of a madman your wife most likely is convinced you are mad and for that reason she has borne with you hitherto but now that you say she may go she ll doubtless avail herself of the permission
answered isabella_linton her eye sparkling irefully there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner endeavours to make himself detested
you are not so bewitched ma am are you as to remain with him of your own accord take care ellen_dean dont put faith in a single word he speaks
he a lying fiend a monster and not a human being i ve been told i might leave him before and i ve made the attempt but i dare not repeat it
whatever he may pretend he wishes to provoke mr_edgar to desperation he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him and he sha nt obtain it i ll die first
only ellen_dean promise you ll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or catherine_earnshaw i just hope i pray that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me
the single pleasure i can imagine is to die or to see him dead there that will do for the present said mr_heathcliff
if you are called upon in a court of law you ll remember her language nelly_dean and take a good look at that countenance she near the point which would suit me
no you re not fit to be your own guardian isabella_linton now and i being your legal protector must retain you in my custody however distasteful the obligation may be
go up stairs i have something to say to ellen_dean in private that not the way up stairs i tell you why this is the road upstairs child
he seized and thrust her from the room and returned muttering i have no pity i have no pity the more the worms writhe the more i yearn to crush out their entrails
it is a moral teething and i grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain do you understand what the word pity means
i said hastening to resume my bonnet did you ever feel a touch of it in your life put that down
come here now nelly_dean i must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see catherine_earnshaw and that without delay
i swear that i meditate no harm i dont desire to cause any disturbance or to exasperate or insult mr mrs_linton_heathcliff i only wish to hear from herself how she is and why she has been ill and to ask if anything that i could do would be of use to her
last night i was in the grange garden six hours and i ll return there to night and every night i ll haunt the place and every day till i find an opportunity of entering
if mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff meets me i shall not hesitate to knock him down and give him enough to insure his quiescence while i stay
he interrupted perceiving my intention to depart you are not going yet if his servants oppose me i shall threaten them off with these pistols
but wouldnt it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them or their master and you could do it so easily
i warn you when i came and then you might let me in unobserved as soon as she was alone and watch till i departed your conscience quite calm
i protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer house and besides i urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying mrs_linton_heathcliff tranquillity for his satisfaction
you would be hindering mischief the commonest occurrence startles her painfully i said she all nerves and she couldnt bear the surprise
dont persist sir or else i shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs and he ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions
in that case i ll take measures to secure you woman exclaimed mr_heathcliff you shall not leave wuthering heights till to morrow morning
it is a foolish story to assert that catherine_earnshaw could not bear to see me and as to surprising her i dont desire it you must prepare her
i positive ask her if i may come you say she never mentions my name and that i am never mentioned to her
to whom should she mention me if i am a forbidden topic in the house she thinks you are all spies for her husband
oh i ve no doubt she in hell among you i guess by her silence as much as anything what she feels
you say she is often restless and anxious looking is that a proof of tranquillity you talk of her mind being unsettled
how the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation and that insipid paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity
he might as well plant an oak in a flower pot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares
let us settle it at once will you stay here and am i to fight my way to catherine_earnshaw over mrs_linton_heathcliff and his footman
from pity and charity or will you be my friend as you have been hitherto and do what i request
well mr_lockwood i argued and complained and flatly refused him fifty time but in the long run he forced me to an agreement
i engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress and should she consent i promised to let him have intelligence of mrs_linton_heathcliff next absence from home when he might come and get in as he was able
decide because there is no reason for my lingering another minute if you persist in your stubborn ill nature i wouldnt be there and my fellow servants should be equally out of the way
i thought i prevented another explosion by my compliance and i thought too it might create a favourable crisis in catherine_earnshaw mental illness
and then i remembered mr_edgar stern rebuke of my carrying tales and i tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject by affirming with frequent iteration that that betrayal of trust if it merited so harsh an appellation should be the last
notwithstanding my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither and many misgivings i had ere i could prevail on myself to put the missive into mrs_linton_heathcliff hand
was it right or wrong i fear it was wrong though expedient but here is mr_kenneth i ll go down and tell him how much better you are
i reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor and not exactly of the kind which i should have chosen to amuse me
my history is dree as we say and will serve to while away another morning dree and dreary but never mind
i ll extract wholesome medicines from mrs ellen_dean bitter herbs and firstly let me beware of the fascination that lurks in catherine_earnshaw mr_heathcliff brilliant eye
i should be in a curious taking if i surrendered my heart to that young person and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother
i have now heard all my neighbour history at different sittings as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupation
chapter xv another week over and i am so many days nearer health and spring i ll continue it in her own word only a little condensed
she is on the whole a very fair narrator and i dont think i could improve her style in the evening she said the evening of my visit to the heights i knew as well as
if i saw him that mr_heathcliff was about the place and i shunned going out because i still carried his letter in my pocket and didnt want to be threatened or teased any more
i had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere as i could not guess how its receipt would affect catherine_earnshaw
the consequence was that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days the fourth was sunday and i brought it into her room after the family were gone to church
there was a manservant left to keep the house with me and we generally made a practice of locking the door during the hours of service but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that i set them wide open and to fulfil my engagement as i knew who would be coming i told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges and he must run over to the village and get a few to be paid for on the morrow
mrs_linton_heathcliff sat in a loose white dress with a light shawl over her shoulders in the recess of the open window as usual
he departed and i went up stairs her thick long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness and now she wore it
her appearance was altered as i had told mr_heathcliff but when she was calm there seemed unearthly beauty in the change
the flash of her eye had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her they appeared always to gaze beyond and far beyond you would have said out of this world
then the paleness of her face its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered flesh and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state though painfully suggestive of their causes added to the touching interest which she awakened and invariably to me i know and to any person who saw her i should think refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence and stamped her as one doomed to decay
simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck a book lay spread on the sill before her and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals
i believe mrs_linton_heathcliff had laid it there for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading or occupation of any kind and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement
she was conscious of his aim and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses
at other time she would turn petulantly away and hide her face in her hand or even push him off angrily and then he took care to let her alone for he was certain of doing no good
gimmerton_kirk chapel bells were still ringing and the full mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear
it was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage which drowned that music about the grange when the trees were in leaf
and of wuthering heights catherine_earnshaw was thinking as she listened that is if she thought or listened at all but she had the vague distant look i mentioned before which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye
there a letter for you mrs_linton_heathcliff i said gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee
at wuthering heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain you must read it immediately because it wants an answer
shall i break the seal yes she answered without altering the direction of her eye i opened it it was very short
i replaced it in her lap and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down but that movement was so long delayed that at last i
now i continued read it she drew away her hand and let it fall resumed must i read it ma am it is from mr_heathcliff
there was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection and a struggle to arrange her ideas she lifted the letter and seemed to peruse it and when she came to the signature she sighed yet
still i found she had not gathered its import for upon my desiring to hear her reply she merely pointed to the name and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness
well he wishes to see you said i guessing her need of an interpreter he in the garden by this time and impatient to know what answer i shall bring
as i spoke i observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark and then smoothing them back announce by a wag of the tail that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger
the minute after a step traversed the hall the open house was too tempting for mr_heathcliff to resist walking in most likely he supposed that i was inclined to shirk my promise and so resolved to trust to his own audacity
mrs_linton_heathcliff bent forward and listened breathlessly with straining eagerness catherine_earnshaw gazed towards the entrance of her chamber he did not hit the right room directly she motioned me to admit him but he found it out
ere i could reach the door and in a stride or two was at her side and had her grasped in his arms
he neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before i daresay but then my mistress had kissed him first and i plainly saw that he could hardly bear for downright agony to look into her face
the same conviction had stricken him as me from the instant he beheld her that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there she was fated sure to die
oh miss_cathy oh my life how can i bear it was the first sentence he uttered in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair
and now he stared at her so earnestly that i thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eye but they burned with anguish they did not melt
what now said catherine_earnshaw leaning back and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices
you and mr_edgar have broken my heart mr_heathcliff and you both come to bewail the deed to me as if you were the people to be pitied
i shall not pity you not i you have killed me and thriven on it i think how strong you are how many year do you mean to live after i am gone
mr_heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her he attempted to rise but she seized his hair and kept him down
i wish i could hold you she continued bitterly till we were both dead i shouldnt care what you suffered i care nothing for your sufferings
why shouldnt you suffer i do will you forget me will you be happy when i am in the earth will you say twenty year hence
that the grave of catherine_earnshaw i loved her long ago and was wretched to lose her but it is past
i ve loved many others since my child are dearer to me than she was and at death i shall not rejoice that i am going to her
will you say so mr_heathcliff dont torture me till i as mad as yourself cried he wrenching his head free and grinding his teeth
i shall be sorry that i must leave them the two to a cool spectator made a strange and fearful picture
well might catherine_earnshaw deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also
her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping
as to her companion while raising himself with one hand he had taken her arm with the other and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition that on his letting go i saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin
do you reflect that all those word will be branded in my memory and eating deeper eternally after you have left me
are you possessed with a devil he pursued savagely to talk in that manner to me when you are dying you know you lie to say i have killed you
is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness that while you are at peace i shall writhe in the torments of hell
i shall not be at peace moaned catherine_earnshaw recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent unequal throbbing of her heart which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation
and catherine_earnshaw you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence she said nothing further till the paroxysm was over then she continued more kindly
i only wish us never to be parted and should a word of mine distress you hereafter think i feel the same distress underground and for my own sake forgive me
i not wishing you greater torment than i have mr_heathcliff come here and kneel down again you never harmed me in your life
nay if you nurse anger that will be worse to remember than my harsh word wont you come here again do
mr_heathcliff went to the back of her chair and leant over but not so far as to let her see his face which was livid with emotion
she bent round to look at him he would not permit it turning abruptly he walked to the fireplace where he stood silent with his back towards us
mrs_linton_heathcliff glance followed him suspiciously every movement woke a new sentiment in her after a pause and a prolonged gaze she resumed addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment
oh you see nelly_dean he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave that is how i loved
well never mind that is not my mr_heathcliff i shall love mine yet and take him with me he in my soul
and added she musingly the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison after all i tired of being enclosed here
i wearying to escape into that glorious world and to be always there not seeing it dimly through tears and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart but really with it and in it
nelly_dean you think you are better and more fortunate than i in full health and strength you are sorry for me very soon that will be altered
i shall be sorry for you i shall be incomparably beyond and above you all i wonder he wont be near me
she went on to herself i thought he wished it mr_heathcliff dear you should not be sullen now do come to me mr_heathcliff
in her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair at that earnest appeal he turned to her looking absolutely desperate
an instant they held asunder and then how they met i hardly saw but catherine_earnshaw made a spring and he caught her and they were locked in an embrace from which i thought my mistress would never be released alive
his eye wide and wet at last flashed fiercely on her his breast heaved convulsively in fact to my eye she seemed directly insensible
he flung himself into the nearest seat and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted he gnashed at me and foamed like a mad dog and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy
i did not feel as if i were in the company of a creature of my own species it appeared that he would not understand though i spoke to him so i stood off and held my tongue in great perplexity
a movement of catherine_earnshaw relieved me a little presently she put up her hand to clasp his neck and bring her cheek to his as he held her while he in return covering her with frantic caresses said wildly
you teach me now how cruel you ve been cruel and false why did you despise me why did you betray your own heart miss_cathy
i have not one word of comfort you deserve this you have killed yourself yes you may kiss me and cry and wring out my kisses and tears they ll blight you
they ll damn you you loved me then what right had you to leave me what right answer me for the poor fancy you felt for mrs_linton_heathcliff
because misery and degradation and death and nothing that god or satan could inflict would have parted us you of your own will did it
i have not broken your heart you have broken it and in breaking it you have broken mine so much the worse for me that i am strong
do i want to live what kind of living will it be when you oh god would you like to live with your soul in the grave let me alone
let me alone sobbed catherine_earnshaw if i ve done wrong i dying for it it is enough you left me too but i wont upbraid you
i forgive you forgive me it is hard to forgive and to look at those eye and feel those wasted hand he answered
kiss me again and dont let me see your eye i forgive what you have done to me i love my murderer but yours
at least i suppose the weeping was on both sides as it seemed mr_heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this
i grew very uncomfortable meanwhile for the afternoon wore fast away the man whom i had sent off returned from his errand and i could distinguish by the shine of the western sun up the valley a concourse thickening outside gimmerton_kirk chapel porch
how can i they were silent their faces hid against each other and washed by each other tears service is over i announced
my master will be here in half an hour mr_heathcliff groaned a curse and strained catherine_earnshaw closer she never moved ere long i perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff was not far behind he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer
now he is here i exclaimed for heaven sake hurry down you ll not meet any one on the front stairs
do be quick and stay among the trees till he is fairly in i must go miss_cathy said mr_heathcliff seeking to extricate himself from his companion arms
but if i live i ll see you again before you are asleep i wont stray five yards from your window
you must not go she answered holding him as firmly as her strength allowed you shall not i tell you for one hour he pleaded earnestly
he would have risen and unfixed her fingers by the act she clung fast gasping there was mad resolution in her face
not for one minute she replied i must mrs_linton_heathcliff will be up immediately persisted the alarmed intruder no she shrieked
oh dont dont go it is the last time mr_edgar will not hurt us mr_heathcliff i shall die i shall die
damn the fool there he is cried mr_heathcliff sinking back into his seat hush my darling hush hush catherine_earnshaw
i ll stay if he shot me so i expire with a blessing on my lips and there they were fast again
i heard my master mounting the stairs the cold sweat ran from my forehead i was horrified are you going to listen to her ravings
i said passionately she does not know what she says will you ruin her because she has not wit to help herself
get up you could be free instantly that is the most diabolical deed that ever you did we are all done for master mistress and servant
in the midst of my agitation i was sincerely glad to observe that catherine_earnshaw arms had fallen relaxed and her head hung down
i wrung my hand and cried out and mr mrs_linton_heathcliff hastened his step at the noise she fainted or dead i thought so much the better
far better that she should be dead than lingering a burden and a misery maker to all about her mr_edgar sprang to his unbidden guest blanched with astonishment and rage
what he meant to do i cannot tell however the other stopped all demonstrations at once by placing the lifeless looking form in his arms
look there he said unless you be a fiend help her first then you shall speak to me he walked into the parlour and sat down
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff summoned me and with great difficulty and after resorting to many means we managed to restore her to sensation but she was all bewildered she sighed and moaned and knew nobody
i went at the earliest opportunity and besought him to depart affirming that catherine_earnshaw was better and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night
i shall not refuse to go out of door he answered but i shall stay in the garden and nelly_dean mind you keep your word to morrow
mr_edgar in his anxiety for her forgot her hated friend i did not i shall be under those larch trees mind or i pay another visit whether mrs_linton_heathcliff be in or not
he sent a rapid glance through the half open door of the chamber and ascertaining that what i stated was apparently true delivered the house of his luckless presence
about twelve clock that night was born the catherine_earnshaw you saw at wuthering heights a puny seven months child and two hours after the mother died having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss mr_heathcliff or know mr_edgar
the latter distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk
i bemoaned that as i gazed on the feeble orphan and i mentally abused old mrs_linton_heathcliff for what was only natural partiality the securing his estate to his own daughter instead of his son
chapter xvi a great addition in my eye was his being left without an heir an unwelcomed infant it was poor thing
it might have wailed out of life and nobody cared a morsel during those first hours of existence we redeemed the neglect afterwards but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be
next morning bright and cheerful out of door stole softened in through the blinds of the silent room and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow tender glow
his young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him and almost as fixed but his was the hush of exhausted anguish and hers of perfect peace
her brow smooth her lids closed her lips wearing the expression of a smile no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared
mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff had his head laid on the pillow and his eye shut and i partook of the infinite calm in which she lay
my mind was never in a holier frame than while i gazed on that untroubled image of divine rest i instinctively echoed the word she had uttered a few hours before incomparably beyond and above us all
i dont know if it be a peculiarity in me but i am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me
i see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break and i feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter the eternity they have entered where life is boundless in its duration and love in its sympathy and joy in its fulness
i noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like mr mrs_linton_heathcliff when he so regretted catherine_earnshaw blessed release
to be sure one might have doubted after the wayward and impatient existence she had led whether she merited a haven of peace at last
whether still on earth or now in heaven her spirit is at home with god one might doubt in seasons of cold reflection but not then in the presence of her corpse
it asserted its own tranquillity which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant do you believe such people are happy in the other world sir
she proceeded retracing the course of catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff i fear we have no right to think she is but we ll leave her with her maker
the master looked asleep and i ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air
the servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch in reality my chief motive was seeing mr_heathcliff
if he had remained among the larches all night he would have heard nothing of the stir at the grange unless perhaps he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to gimmerton_kirk
if he had come nearer he would probably be aware from the light flitting to and fro and the opening and shutting of the outer door that all was not right within
i give a great deal to know i declined answering mrs ellen_dean question which struck me as something heterodox i wished yet feared to find him
i felt the terrible news must be told and i longed to get it over but how to do it i did not know
he was there at least a few yards further in the park leant against an old ash tree his hat off and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches and fell pattering round him
he had been standing a long time in that position for i saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him busy in building their nest and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber
they flew off at my approach and he raised his eye and spoke she dead he said i ve not waited for you to learn that
i was weeping as much for him as her we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others
when i first looked into his face i perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground
put your handkerchief away dont snivel before me damn you all she wants none of your tears yes she dead i answered checking my sobs and drying my cheeks
gone to heaven i hope where we may every one join her if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good
did she take due warning then asked mr_heathcliff attempting a sneer did she die like a saint come give me a true history of the event
he endeavoured to pronounce the name but could not manage it and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony defying meanwhile my sympathy with an unflinching ferocious stare
he resumed at last fain notwithstanding his hardihood to have a support behind him for after the struggle he trembled in spite of himself to his very finger ends
how did how did she die poor wretch i thought you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men
why should you be anxious to conceal them your pride cannot blind god you tempt him to wring them till he forces a cry of humiliation
she drew a sigh and stretched herself like a child reviving and sinking again to sleep and five minutes after i felt one little pulse at her heart and nothing more
he asked hesitating as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear
quietly as a lamb i answered aloud and did she ever mention me her senses never returned she recognised nobody from the time you left her i said
she lies with a sweet smile on her face and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days her life closed in a gentle dream may she wake as kindly in the other world
may she wake in torment he cried with frightful vehemence stamping his foot and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion
why she a liar to the end where is she not there not in heaven not perished where oh you said you cared nothing for my sufferings
and i pray one prayer i repeat it till my tongue stiffens catherine_earnshaw may you not rest as long as i am living you said i killed you haunt me then
the murdered do haunt their murderers i believe i know that ghosts have wandered on earth be with me always take any form drive me mad
only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you oh god it is unutterable i cannot live without my life
he dashed his head against the knotted trunk and lifting up his eye howled not like a man but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears
i observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree and his hand and forehead were both stained probably the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night
i cannot live without my soul it hardly moved my compassion it appalled me still i felt reluctant to quit him so
but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching he thundered a command for me to go and i obeyed
mrs_linton_heathcliff funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following her decease and till then her coffin remained uncovered and strewn with flowers and scented leaves in the great drawing room
mrs_linton_heathcliff spent his days and nights there a sleepless guardian and a circumstance concealed from all but me mr_heathcliff spent his nights at least outside equally a stranger to repose
i held no communication with him still i was conscious of his design to enter if he could and on the tuesday a little after dark when my master from sheer fatigue had been compelled to retire a couple of hours i went and opened one of the window moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu
he did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity cautiously and briefly too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise
indeed i shouldnt have discovered that he had been there except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse face and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair fastened with a silver thread which on examination i ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round catherine_earnshaw neck
he was beyond my skill to quiet or console mr_heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents replacing them by a black lock of his own
mr catherine_earnshaw was of course invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave he sent no excuse but he never came so that besides her husband the mourners were wholly composed of tenant and servants
the place of catherine_earnshaw interment to the surprise of the villagers was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons nor yet by the tombs of her own relations outside
it was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirk yard where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor and peat mould almost buries it
her husband lies in the same spot now and they have each a simple headstone above and a plain grey block at their feet to mark the graves
i twisted the two and enclosed them together isabella_linton was not asked chapter xvii that friday made the last of our fine days for a month
in the evening the weather broke the wind shifted from south to north east and brought rain first and then sleet and snow
on the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts the larks were silent the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened
my master kept his room i took possession of the lonely parlour converting it into a nursery and there i was sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee rocking it to and fro and watching meanwhile the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window when the door opened and some person entered out of breath and laughing
and dreary and chill and dismal that morrow did creep over my anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute
i supposed it one of the maids and i cried have done how dare you show your giddiness here what would mr mrs_linton_heathcliff say if he heard you excuse me
answered a familiar voice but i know mr_edgar is in bed and i cannot stop myself with that the speaker came forward to the fire panting and holding her hand to her side
i have run the whole way from wuthering heights she continued after a pause except where i ve flown i couldnt count the number of falls i ve had
there shall be an explanation as soon as i can give it only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to gimmerton_kirk and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe
she certainly seemed in no laughing predicament her hair streamed on her shoulders dripping with snow and water she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore befitting her age more than her position a low frock with short sleeves and nothing on either head or neck
the frock was of light silk and clung to her with wet and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers add to this a deep cut under one ear which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely a white face scratched and bruised and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when i had had leisure to examine her
my dear young lady i exclaimed i ll stir nowhere and hear nothing till you have removed every article of your clothes and put on dry things and certainly you shall not go to gimmerton_kirk to night so it is needless to order the carriage
oh i aching all over dont be alarmed the intruder was mrs mr_heathcliff certainly i shall she said walking or riding yet
i ve no objection to dress myself decently and ah see how it flows down my neck now the fire does make it smart
she insisted on my fulfilling her directions before she would let me touch her and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire did i obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments
she said when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy chair on the hearth with a cup of tea before her you sit down opposite me and put poor catherine_earnshaw baby away i dont like to see it
now ellen_dean you mustnt think i care little for catherine_earnshaw because i behaved so foolishly on entering i ve cried too bitterly yes more than any one else has reason to cry
we parted unreconciled you remember and i sha nt forgive myself but for all that i was not going to sympathise with him the brute beast
oh give me the poker this is the last thing of his i have about me she slipped the gold ring from her third finger and threw it on the floor
i ll smash it she continued striking it with childish spite and then i ll burn it and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals
there he shall buy another if he gets me back again he be capable of coming to seek me to tease mr_edgar
i dare not stay lest that notion should possess his wicked head and besides mr_edgar has not been kind has he
necessity compelled me to seek shelter here though if i had not learned he was out of the way i have halted at the kitchen washed my face warmed myself got you to bring what i wanted and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed of that incarnate goblin
and i wont come suing for his assistance nor will i bring him into more trouble ah he was in such a fury
catherine_earnshaw is not his match in strength i wouldnt have run till i seen him all but demolished had mr_hindley been able to do it
if he had caught me it a pity well dont talk so fast miss i interrupted you ll disorder the handkerchief i have tied round your face and make the cut bleed again
drink your tea and take breath and give over laughing laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in your condition an undeniable truth she replied
listen to that child it maintains a constant wail send it out of my hearing for an hour i sha nt stay any longer
i rang the bell and committed it to a servant care and then i inquired what had urged her to escape from wuthering heights in such an unlikely plight and where she meant to go as she refused remaining with us
i ought and i wished to remain answered she to cheer mr_edgar and take care of the baby for two things and because the grange is my right home
do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry could bear to think that we were tranquil and not resolve on poisoning our comfort
now i have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear shot or eyesight
i notice when i enter his presence the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes i have to feel that sentiment for him and partly from original aversion
it is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over england supposing i contrived a clear escape and therefore i must get quite away
but i tell you he wouldnt let me i ve recovered from my first desire to be killed by him i rather he kill himself
i can recollect yet how i loved him and can dimly imagine that i could still be loving him if no no
he has extinguished my love effectually and so i at my ease even if he had doted on me the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow
catherine_earnshaw had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly knowing him so well monster would that he could be blotted out of creation and out of my memory
hush hush he a human being i said be more charitable there are worse men than he is yet
he not a human being she retorted and he has no claim on my charity i gave him my heart and he took and pinched it to death and flung it back to me
people feel with their hearts ellen_dean and since he has destroyed mine i have not power to feel for him and i would not though he groaned from this to his dying day and wept tears of blood for catherine_earnshaw
no indeed indeed i wouldnt and here isabella_linton began to cry but immediately dashing the water from her lashes she recommenced
you asked what has driven me to flight at last i was compelled to attempt it because i had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity
pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head he was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of and proceeded to murderous violence
i experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self preservation so i fairly broke free and if ever i come into his hand again
he kept himself sober for the purpose tolerably sober not going to bed mad at six clock and getting up drunk at twelve
consequently he rose in suicidal low spirits as fit for the church as for a dance and instead he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls
he is welcome to a signal revenge yesterday you know mr catherine_earnshaw should have been at the funeral mr_heathcliff i shudder to name him
whether the angels have fed him or his kin beneath i cannot tell but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week
he has just come home at dawn and gone up stairs to his chamber locking himself in as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company
there he has continued praying like a methodist only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes and god when addressed was curiously confounded with his own black father
after concluding these precious orisons and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat he would be off again always straight down to the grange
has been a stranger in the house from last sunday till to day i wonder mr_edgar did not send for a constable and give him into custody
for me grieved as i was about catherine_earnshaw it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday
i recovered spirits sufficient to bear joseph eternal lectures without weeping and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly
i rather sit with mr_hindley and hear his awful talk than witht little maister and his staunch supporter that odious old man
when mr_heathcliff is in i often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers when he is not as was the case this week
i establish a table and chair at one corner of the house fire and never mind how mr catherine_earnshaw may occupy himself and he does not interfere with my arrangements
he is quieter now than he used to be if no one provokes him more sullen and depressed and less furious
joseph affirms he sure he an altered man that the lord has touched his heart and he is saved so as by fire
you wouldnt think that i should cry at anything joseph could say but he and hareton_earnshaw are detestable companions i puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change but it is not my business
it seemed so dismal to go up stairs with the wild snow blowing outside and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirk yard and the new made grave
yester evening i sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve i dared hardly lift my eye from the page before me that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place
mr_hindley sat opposite his head leant on his hand perhaps meditating on the same subject he had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours
and then the faint crackling of the coals and the click of my snuffers as i removed at intervals the long wick of the candle
there was no sound through the house but the moaning wind which shook the window every now hareton_earnshaw and joseph were probably fast asleep in bed
it was very very sad and while i read i sighed for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world never to be restored
the doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch mr_heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual owing i suppose to the sudden storm
i rose with an irrepressible expression of what i felt on my lips which induced my companion who had been staring towards the door to turn and look at me
that entrance was fastened and we heard him coming round to get in by the other i ll keep him out five minutes he exclaimed
you wont object no you may keep him out the whole night for me i answered do put the key in the lock and draw the bolts
catherine_earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table leaning over it and searching in my eye for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his as he both looked and felt like an assassin he couldnt exactly find that but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak
you and i he said have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder if we were neither of us cowards we might combine to discharge it
are you as soft as your brother are you willing to endure to the last and not once attempt a repayment
i weary of enduring now i replied and i be glad of a retaliation that wouldnt recoil on myself but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies
treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence cried mr_hindley mrs mr_heathcliff i ll ask you to do nothing but sit still and be dumb
i sure you would have as much pleasure as i in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend existence he ll be your death unless you overreach him and he ll be my ruin
tell me now can you damn the hellish villain he knocks at the door as if he were master here already
he took the implements which i described to you in my letter from his breast and would have turned down the candle
promise to hold your tongue and before that clock strikes it wants three minutes of one you re a free woman i snatched it away however and seized his arm
i ll not hold my tongue i said you mustnt touch him let the door remain shut and be quiet
no i ve formed my resolution and by god i ll execute it cried the desperate being i ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself and hareton_earnshaw justice
nobody alive would regret me or be ashamed though i cut my throat this minute and it time to make an end
and you neednt trouble your head to screen me catherine_earnshaw is gone i might as well have struggled with a bear or reasoned with a lunatic
the only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him
you better seek shelter somewhere else to night i exclaimed in rather a triumphant tone mr catherine_earnshaw has a mind to shoot you if you persist in endeavouring to enter
you better open the door you he answered addressing me by some elegant term that i dont care to repeat
i shall not meddle in the matter i retorted again come in and get shot if you please i ve done my duty
with that i shut the window and returned to my place by the fire having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him
catherine_earnshaw swore passionately at me affirming that i loved the villain yet and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit i evinced
should mr_heathcliff put him out of misery and what a blessing for me should he send mr_heathcliff to his right abode
as i sat nursing these reflections the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual and his black countenance looked blightingly through
and i in my secret heart and conscience never reproached me thought what a blessing it would be for him the stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow and i smiled exulting in my fancied security
his hair and clothes were whitened with snow and his sharp cannibal teeth revealed by cold and wrath gleamed through the dark
isabella_linton let me in or i ll make you repent he girned as joseph calls it i cannot commit murder i replied
mr_hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol let me in by the kitchen door he said
mr_hindley will be there before me i answered and that a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow
we were left at peace in our beds as long as the summer moon shone but the moment a blast of winter returns you must run for shelter
mr_heathcliff if i were you i go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog the world is surely not worth living in now is it
you had distinctly impressed on me the idea that catherine_earnshaw was the whole joy of your life i cant imagine how you think of surviving her loss
he there is he exclaimed my companion rushing to the gap if i can get my arm out
i can hit him i afraid ellen_dean you ll set me down as really wicked but you dont know all so dont judge
wish that he were dead i must and therefore i was fearfully disappointed and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech when he flung himself on catherine_earnshaw weapon and wrenched it from his grasp
i wouldnt have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life for anything the charge exploded and the knife in springing back closed into its owner wrist
mr_heathcliff pulled it away by main force slitting up the flesh as it passed on and thrust it dripping into his pocket
his adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood that gushed from an artery or a large vein
the ruffian kicked and trampled on him and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags holding me with one hand meantime to prevent me summoning joseph
he exerted preterhuman self denial in abstaining from finishing him completely but getting out of breath he finally desisted and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle
there he tore off the sleeve of catherine_earnshaw coat and bound up the wound with brutal roughness spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before
being at liberty i lost no time in seeking the old servant who having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale hurried below gasping as he descended the steps two at once
he then took a stone struck down the division between two window and sprang in what is ther to do now
there this to do thundered mr_heathcliff that your master mad and should he last another month i ll have him to an asylum
what is ther to do now and how the devil did you come to fasten me out you toothless hound dont stand muttering and mumbling there
come i not going to nurse him wash that stuff away and mind the sparks of your candle it is more than half brandy
and so ye ve been murthering on him exclaimed joseph lifting his hand and eye in horror if iver i seed a seeght loike this
mr_heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood and flung a towel to him but instead of proceeding to dry it up he joined his hand and began a prayer which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology
i was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing in fact i was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows
may the lord oh i forgot you said the tyrant you shall do that down with you and you conspire with him against me do you viper
he shook me till my teeth rattled and pitched me beside joseph who steadily concluded his supplications and then rose vowing he would set off for the grange directly
there that is work fit for you mr mrs_linton_heathcliff was a magistrate and though he had fifty wives dead he should inquire into this
he was so obstinate in his resolution that mr_heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place standing over me heaving with malevolence as i reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions
it required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that mr_heathcliff was not the aggressor especially with my hardly wrung replies
however mr catherine_earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness
mr_heathcliff aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible called him deliriously intoxicated and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further but advised him to get to bed
to my joy he left us after giving this judicious counsel and mr_hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone i departed to my own room marvelling that i had escaped so easily
this morning when i came down about half an hour before noon mr catherine_earnshaw was sitting by the fire deadly sick his evil genius almost as gaunt and ghastly leant against the chimney
nothing hindered me from eating heartily and i experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority as at intervals i cast a look towards my silent companions and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me
after i had done i ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire going round catherine_earnshaw seat and kneeling in the corner beside him
mr_heathcliff did not glance my way and i gazed up and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone
his forehead that i once thought so manly and that i now think so diabolical was shaded with a heavy cloud his basilisk eye were nearly quenched by sleeplessness and weeping perhaps for the lashes were wet then his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness
neither appeared inclined to dine and having waited till all was cold on the table i commenced alone had it been another i would have covered my face in the presence of such grief
in his case i was gratified and ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy i couldnt miss this chance of sticking in a dart his weakness was the only time when i could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong
fie fie miss i interrupted one might suppose you had never opened a bible in your life if god afflict your enemies surely that ought to suffice you
it is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his in general i ll allow that it would be ellen_dean she continued but what misery laid on mr_heathcliff could content me unless i have a hand in it
i rather he suffered less if i might cause his sufferings and he might know that i was the cause oh i owe him so much
it is if i may take an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth for every wrench of agony return a wrench reduce him to my level
as he was the first to injure make him the first to implore pardon and then why then ellen_dean i might show you some generosity
on only one condition can i hope to forgive him but it is utterly impossible i can ever be revenged and therefore i cannot forgive him
mr_hindley wanted some water and i handed him a glass and asked him how he was not as ill as i wish he replied
but leaving out my arm every inch of me is as sore as if i had been fighting with a legion of imps
catherine_earnshaw used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her
yes no wonder was my next remark it well people dont really rise from their grave or last night she might have witnessed a repulsive scene
are not you bruised and cut over your chest and shoulders i cant say he answered but what do you mean
did he dare to strike me when i was down he trampled on and kicked you and dashed you on the ground i whispered
and his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth because he only half man not so much and the rest fiend
mr catherine_earnshaw looked up like me to the countenance of our mutual foe who absorbed in his anguish seemed insensible to anything around him the longer he stood the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features
oh if god would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony i go to hell with joy groaned the impatient man writhing to rise and sinking back in despair convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle
nay it enough that he has murdered one of you i observed aloud at the grange every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for mr_heathcliff
after all it is preferable to be hated than loved by him when i recollect how happy we were how happy catherine_earnshaw was before he came i fit to curse the day
most likely mr_heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said than the spirit of the person who said it
his attention was roused i saw for his eye rained down tears among the ashes and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs
the clouded window of hell flashed a moment towards me the fiend which usually looked out however was so dimmed and drowned that i did not fear to hazard another sound of derision
i stared full at him and laughed scornfully get up and begone out of my sight said the mourner i guessed he uttered those word at least though his voice was hardly intelligible
i beg your pardon i replied but i loved catherine_earnshaw too and her brother requires attendance which for her sake i shall supply
mr_hindley has exactly her eye if you had not tried to gouge them out and made them black and red and her
now that she dead i see her in mr_hindley get up wretched idiot before i stamp you to death he cried making a movement that caused me to make one also
but then i continued holding myself ready to flee if poor catherine_earnshaw had trusted you and assumed the ridiculous contemptible degrading title of mrs mr_heathcliff she would soon have presented a similar picture
the back of the settle and catherine_earnshaw person interposed between me and him so instead of endeavouring to reach me he snatched a dinner knife from the table and flung it at my head
it struck beneath my ear and stopped the sentence i was uttering but pulling it out i sprang to the door and delivered another which i hope went a little deeper than his missile
the last glimpse i caught of him was a furious rush on his part checked by the embrace of his host and both fell locked together on the hearth
in my flight through the kitchen i bid joseph speed to his master i knocked over hareton_earnshaw who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair back in the doorway and blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory i bounded leaped and flew down the steep road then quitting its windings shot direct across the moor rolling over banks and wading through marshes precipitating myself in fact towards the beacon light of the grange
and far rather would i be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than even for one night abide beneath the roof of wuthering heights again
isabella_linton ceased speaking and took a drink of tea then she rose and bidding me put on her bonnet and a great shawl i had brought and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour she stepped on to a chair kissed mr_edgar and catherine_earnshaw portraits bestowed a similar salute on me and descended to the carriage accompanied by fanny who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress
she was driven away never to revisit this neighbourhood but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled
i believe her new abode was in the south near london there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape
she wouldnt have borne your abominable behaviour quietly her detestation and disgust must have found voice he was christened mrs_linton_heathcliff and from the first she reported him to be an ailing peevish creature
he remarked that it was not of any moment only she must beware of coming to her brother she should not be with him if he had to keep her himself
though i would give no information he discovered through some of the other servants both her place of residence and the existence of the child
mr_heathcliff meeting me one day in the village inquired where she lived i refused to tell still he didnt molest her for which forbearance she might thank his aversion i suppose
he often asked about the infant when he saw me and on hearing its name smiled grimly and observed they wish me to hate it too do they i dont think they wish you to know anything about it i answered
fortunately its mother died before the time arrived some thirteen year after the decease of catherine_earnshaw when mrs_linton_heathcliff was twelve or a little more
on the day succeeding isabella_linton unexpected visit i had no opportunity of speaking to my master he shunned conversation and was fit for discussing nothing
when i could get him to listen i saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow
so deep and sensitive was his aversion that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of mr_heathcliff
grief and that together transformed him into a complete hermit he threw up his office of magistrate ceased even to attend church avoided the village on all occasions and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds only varied by solitary rambles on the moors and visits to the grave of his wife mostly at evening or early morning before other wanderers were abroad
but i ll have it he said when i want it they may reckon on that but he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long
he recalled her memory with ardent tender love and hopeful aspiring to the better world where he doubted not she was gone
he didnt pray for catherine_earnshaw soul to haunt him time brought resignation and a melancholy sweeter than common joy and he had earthly consolation and affections also
for a few days i said he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed that coldness melted as fast as snow in april and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot sceptre in his heart
it was named catherine_earnshaw but he never called it the name in full as he had never called the first catherine_earnshaw short probably because mr_heathcliff had a habit of doing so
the little one was always miss_cathy it formed to him a distinction from the mother and yet a connection with her and his attachment sprang from its relation to her far more than from its being his own
i used to draw a comparison between him and mr_hindley catherine_earnshaw and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances
they had both been fond husbands and were both attached to their child and i could not see how they shouldnt both have taken the same road for good or evil
but i thought in my mind mr_hindley with apparently the stronger head has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man
when his ship struck the captain abandoned his post and the crew instead of trying to save her rushed into riot and confusion leaving no hope for their luckless vessel
mrs_linton_heathcliff on the contrary displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul he trusted god and god comforted him
but you ll not want to hear my moralising mr_lockwood you ll judge as well as i can all these things at least you ll think you will and that the same
the end of catherine_earnshaw was what might have been expected it followed fast on his sister there were scarcely six months between them
we at the grange never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it all that i did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral
one hoped and the other despaired they chose their own lots and were righteously doomed to endure them mr_kenneth came to announce the event to my master
well nelly_dean said he riding into the yard one morning too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news it yours and my turn to go into mourning at present
who given us the slip now do you think who i asked in a flurry why guess he returned dismounting and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door
and nip up the corner of your apron i certain you ll need it not mr_heathcliff surely i exclaimed
what would you have tears for him said the doctor no mr_heathcliff a tough young fellow he looks blooming to day
i ve just seen him he rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half who is it then mr_kenneth
i repeated impatiently mr_hindley catherine_earnshaw your old friend mr_hindley he replied and my wicked gossip though he been too wild for me this long while
there i said we should draw water but cheer up he died true to his character drunk as a lord poor lad
one cant help missing an old companion though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined and has done me many a rascally turn
i sorry too he barely twenty seven it seems that your own age who would have thought you were born in one year
i confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of mrs_linton_heathcliff death ancient associations lingered round my heart i sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation desiring mr_kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master
whatever i did that idea would bother me it was so tiresomely pertinacious that i resolved on requesting leave to go to wuthering heights and assist in the last duties to the dead
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff was extremely reluctant to consent but i pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay and i said my old master and foster brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own
besides i reminded him that the child hareton_earnshaw was his wife nephew and in the absence of nearer kin he ought to act as its guardian and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left and look over the concerns of his brother in law
he was unfit for attending to such matters then but he bid me speak to his lawyer and at length permitted me to go
i could not hinder myself from pondering on the question had he had fair play his lawyer had been catherine_earnshaw also i called at the village and asked him to accompany me
he shook his head and advised that mr_heathcliff should be let alone affirming if the truth were known hareton_earnshaw would be found little else than a beggar
his father died in debt he said the whole property is mortgaged and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor heart that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him
when i reached the heights i explained that i had come to see everything carried on decently and joseph who appeared in sufficient distress expressed satisfaction at my presence
mr_heathcliff said he did not perceive that i was wanted but i might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral if i chose
i happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon and in that interval he fastened the two door of the house against me and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately
we broke in this morning for we heard him sporting like a horse and there he was laid over the settle flaying and scalping would not have wakened him
i sent for mr_kenneth and he came but not till the beast had changed into carrion he was both dead and cold and stark and so you ll allow it was useless making more stir about him
correctly he remarked that fool body should be buried at the cross roads without ceremony of any kind the old servant confirmed this statement but muttered i rayther he goan hisseln fort doctor
i sud ha taen tent ot maister better nor him and he warnt deead when i left naught ot soart
mr_heathcliff said i might have my own way there too only he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket
he maintained a hard careless deportment indicative of neither joy nor sorrow if anything it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed
i insisted on the funeral being respectable i observed once indeed something like exultation in his aspect it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house
he had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner and previous to following with hareton_earnshaw he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered with peculiar gusto now my bonny lad you are mine
the unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech he played with mr_heathcliff whiskers and stroked his cheek but i divined its meaning and observed tartly that boy must go back with me to thrushcross_grange sir
and we ll see if one tree wont grow as crooked as another with the same wind to twist it there is nothing in the world less yours than he is
well said the scoundrel we ll not argue the subject now but i have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one so intimate to your master that i must supply the place of this with my own if he attempt to remove it
does mrs_linton_heathcliff say so he demanded of course he has ordered me to take him i replied i dont engage to let hareton_earnshaw go undisputed but i ll be pretty sure to make the other come
remember to tell him this hint was enough to bind our hand i repeated its substance on my return and mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff little interested at the commencement spoke no more of interfering
the guest was now the master of wuthering heights he held firm possession and proved to the attorney who in his turn proved it to mr mrs_linton_heathcliff that catherine_earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming and he mr_heathcliff was the mortgagee
in that manner hareton_earnshaw who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father inveterate enemy and lives in his own house as a servant deprived of the advantage of wages quite unable to right himself because of his friendlessness and his ignorance that he has been wronged
the twelve year continued mrs ellen_dean following that dismal period were the happiest of my life my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little lady trifling illnesses which she had to experience in common with all child rich and poor
for the rest after the first six months she grew like a larch and could walk and talk too in her own way before the heath blossomed a second time over mrs_linton_heathcliff dust
she was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house a real beauty in face with the earnshaws handsome dark eye but the lintons fair skin and small features and yellow curling hair
i not aware that he could have done it to any purpose had he been ever so willing chapter xviii her spirit was high though not rough and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections
that capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother still she did not resemble her for she could be soft and mild as a dove and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression her anger was never furious her love never fierce it was deep and tender
a propensity to be saucy was one and a perverse will that indulged child invariably acquire whether they be good tempered or cross
however it must be acknowledged she had faults to foil her gifts if a servant chanced to vex her it was always i shall tell papa
and if he reproved her even by a look you would have thought it a heart breaking business i dont believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her
fortunately curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar she learned rapidly and eagerly and did honour to his teaching
he took her education entirely on himself and made it an amusement till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff would take her with him a mile or so outside on rare occasions but he trusted her to no one else
gimmerton_kirk was an unsubstantial name in her ears the chapel the only building she had approached or entered except her own home
sometimes indeed while surveying the country from her nursery window she would observe ellen_dean how long will it be before i can walk to the top of those hills
wuthering heights and mr_heathcliff did not exist for her she was a perfect recluse and apparently perfectly contented i wonder what lies on the other side is it the sea
no miss_cathy i would answer it is hills again just like these and what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them
the abrupt descent of penistone crags particularly attracted her notice especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow
i explained that they were bare masses of stone with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree
because they are a great deal higher up than we are replied i you could not climb them they are too high and steep
in winter the frost is always there before it comes to us and deep into summer i have found snow under that black hollow on the north east side
she once asked and why are they bright so long after it is evening here she pursued oh you have been on them
she cried gleefully then i can go too when i am a woman has papa been ellen_dean papa would tell you miss i answered hastily that they are not worth the trouble of visiting
the moors where you ramble with him are much nicer and thrushcross park is the finest place in the world
but i know the park and i dont know those she murmured to herself and i should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point
one of the maids mentioning the fairy cave quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project she teased mr mrs_linton_heathcliff about it and he promised she should have the journey when she got older
but miss catherine_earnshaw measured her age by months and now am i old enough to go to penistone crags was the constant question in her mouth
my little pony minny shall take me some time the road thither wound close by wuthering heights mr_edgar had not the heart to pass it so she received as constantly the answer not yet love not yet
her family were of a delicate constitution she and mr_edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts
what her last illness was i am not certain i conjecture they died of the same thing a kind of fever slow at its commencement but incurable and rapidly consuming life towards the close
she wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four months indisposition under which she had suffered and entreated him to come to her if possible for she had much to settle and she wished to bid him adieu and deliver mrs_linton_heathcliff safely into his hand
her hope was that mrs_linton_heathcliff might be left with him as he had been with her his father she would fain convince herself had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education
my master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls he flew to answer this commanding catherine_earnshaw to my peculiar vigilance in his absence with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied
the first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library too sad for either reading or playing in that quiet state she caused me little trouble but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient fretful weariness and being too busy and too old then to run up and down amusing her i hit on a method by which she might entertain herself
i used to send her on her travels round the grounds now on foot and now on a pony indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned
the summer shone in full prime and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales
i did not fear her breaking bounds because the gates were generally locked and i thought she would scarcely venture forth alone if they had stood wide open
i said mrs mr_heathcliff lived above a dozen year after quitting her husband he was away three weeks unluckily my confidence proved misplaced
catherine_earnshaw came to me one morning at eight clock and said she was that day an arabian merchant going to cross the desert with his caravan and i must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts a horse and three camels personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers
i got together good store of dainties and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle and she sprang up as gay as a fairy sheltered by her wide brimmed hat and gauze veil from the july sun and trotted off with a merry laugh mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping and come back early
one traveller the hound being an old dog and fond of its ease returned but neither miss_cathy nor the pony nor the two pointers were visible in any direction i despatched emissaries down this path and that path and at last went wandering in search of her myself
the naughty thing never made her appearance at tea there was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation on the borders of the grounds
i saw her at morn he replied she would have me to cut her a hazel switch and then she leapt her galloway over the hedge yonder where it is lowest and galloped out of sight
i inquired of him if he had seen our young lady you may guess how i felt at hearing this news
it struck me directly she must have started for penistone crags what will become of her i ejaculated pushing through a gap which the man was repairing and making straight to the high road
i walked as if for a wager mile after mile till a turn brought me in view of the heights but no catherine_earnshaw could i detect far or near
the crags lie about a mile and a half beyond mr_heathcliff place and that is four from the grange so i began to fear night would fall ere i could reach them
and what if she should have slipped in clambering among them i reflected and been killed or broken some of her bones
my suspense was truly painful and at first it gave me delightful relief to observe in hurrying by the farmhouse charlie the fiercest of the pointers lying under a window with swelled head and bleeding ear
a woman whom i knew and who formerly lived at gimmerton_kirk answered she had been servant there since the death of mr catherine_earnshaw
i opened the wicket and ran to the door knocking vehemently for admittance ah said she you are come a seeking your little mistress
dont be frightened she here safe but i glad it isnt the master he is not at home then is he
i panted quite breathless with quick walking and alarm no no she replied both he and joseph are off and i think they wont return this hour or more
i entered and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mother when a child
her hat was hung against the wall and she seemed perfectly at home laughing and chattering in the best spirits imaginable to hareton_earnshaw now a great strong lad of eighteen who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth
step in and rest you a bit very well miss i exclaimed concealing my joy under an angry countenance this is your last ride till papa comes back
i ll not trust you over the threshold again you naughty naughty girl aha ellen_dean she cried gaily jumping up and running to my side
i shall have a pretty story to tell to night and so you ve found me out have you ever been here in your life before
put that hat on and home at once said i i dreadfully grieved at you miss_cathy you ve done extremely wrong
it no use pouting and crying that wont repay the trouble i ve had scouring the country after you to think how mr mrs_linton_heathcliff charged me to keep you in and you stealing off so
it shows you are a cunning little fox and nobody will put faith in you any more what have i done
sobbed she instantly checked papa charged me nothing he ll not scold me ellen_dean he never cross like you come come i repeated
i ll tie the riband now let us have no petulance oh for shame you thirteen year old and such a baby
this exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head and retreating to the chimney out of my reach
nay said the servant dont be hard on the bonny lass mrs ellen_dean we made her stop she fain have ridden forwards afeard you should be uneasy
hareton_earnshaw during the discussion stood with his hand in his pockets too awkward to speak though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion
hareton_earnshaw offered to go with her and i thought he should it a wild road over the hills how long am i to wait
i continued disregarding the woman interference it will be dark in ten minutes where is the pony miss_cathy and where is phoenix
i shall leave you unless you be quick so please yourself the pony is in the yard she replied and phoenix is shut in there
i was going to tell you all about it but you are in a bad temper and dont deserve to hear
i picked up her hat and approached to reinstate it but perceiving that the people of the house took her part she commenced capering round the room and on my giving chase ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue
he bitten and so is charlie hareton_earnshaw and the woman laughed and she joined them and waxed more impertinent still till i cried in great irritation well
miss_cathy if you were aware whose house this is you be glad enough to get out it your father isnt it
said she turning to hareton_earnshaw nay he replied looking down and blushing bashfully he could not stand a steady gaze from her eye though they were just his own
whose then your master she asked he coloured deeper with a different feeling muttered an oath and turned away who is his master continued the tiresome girl appealing to me
he talked about our house and our folk i thought he had been the owner son and he never said miss he should have done shouldnt he if he a servant
hareton_earnshaw grew black as a thunder cloud at this childish speech i silently shook my questioner and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure
now get my horse she said addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable boys at the grange
i want to see where the goblin hunter rises in the marsh and to hear about the fairishes as you call them but make haste
and you may come with me what the matter get my horse i say i ll see thee damned before i be thy servant growled the lad
you ll see me what asked catherine_earnshaw in surprise damned thou saucy witch he replied there miss_cathy you see you have got into pretty company i interposed
nice word to be used to a young lady pray dont begin to dispute with him come let us seek for minny ourselves and begone
but ellen_dean cried she staring fixed in astonishment how dare he speak so to me mustnt he be made to do as i ask him
you wicked creature i shall tell papa what you said now then hareton_earnshaw did not appear to feel this threat so the tears sprang into her eye with indignation
you bring the pony she exclaimed turning to the woman and let my dog free this moment softly miss answered she addressed you ll lose nothing by being civil
though mr hareton_earnshaw there be not the master son he your cousin and i was never hired to serve you
he my cousin cried miss_cathy with a scornful laugh yes indeed responded her reprover oh ellen_dean dont let them say such things she pursued in great trouble
papa is gone to fetch my cousin from london my cousin is a gentleman son that my she stopped and wept outright upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown
i whispered people can have many cousins and of all sorts miss_cathy without being any the worse for it only they neednt keep their company if they be disagreeable and bad
hush hush he not he not my cousin ellen_dean she went on gathering fresh grief from reflection and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea
i was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations having no doubt of mrs_linton_heathcliff approaching arrival communicated by the former being reported to mr_heathcliff and feeling as confident that catherine_earnshaw first thought on her father return would be to seek an explanation of the latter assertion concerning her rude bred kindred
hareton_earnshaw recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant seemed moved by her distress and having fetched the pony round to the door he took to propitiate her a fine crooked legged terrier whelp from the kennel and putting it into her hand bid her whist for he meant nought
i could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow who was a well made athletic youth good looking in features and stout and healthy but attired in garments befitting his daily occupation of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game
pausing in her lamentations she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror then burst forth anew still i thought i could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed
good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds to be sure whose rankness far over topped their neglected growth yet notwithstanding evidence of a wealthy soil that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances
mr_heathcliff i believe had not treated him physically ill thanks to his fearless nature which offered no temptation to that course of oppression he had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill treatment in mr_heathcliff judgment
he appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute he was never taught to read or write never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper never led a single step towards virtue or guarded by a single precept against vice
and from what i heard joseph contributed much to his deterioration by a narrow minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him as a boy because he was the head of the old family
and as he had been in the habit of accusing catherine_earnshaw and mr_heathcliff when child of putting the master past his patience and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their offald ways so at present he laid the whole burden of hareton_earnshaw faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property
it gave joseph satisfaction apparently to watch him go the worst lengths he allowed that the lad was ruined that his soul was abandoned to perdition but then he reflected that mr_heathcliff must answer for it
if the lad swore he wouldnt correct him nor however culpably he behaved hareton_earnshaw blood would be required at his hand and there lay immense consolation in that thought
joseph had instilled into him a pride of name and of his lineage he would had he dared have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the heights but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations
i dont pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at wuthering heights i only speak from hearsay for i saw little
the villagers affirmed mr_heathcliff was near and a cruel hard landlord to his tenant but the house inside had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management and the scenes of riot common in mr_hindley time were not now enacted within its walls
the master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people good or bad and he is yet this however is not making progress with my story
they came limping and hanging their head and we set out for home sadly out of sorts every one of us
i could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day except that as i supposed the goal of her pilgrimage was penistone crags and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farm house when hareton_earnshaw happened to issue forth attended by some canine followers who attacked her train
miss_cathy rejected the peace offering of the terrier and demanded her own dogs charlie and phoenix they had a smart battle before their owners could separate them that formed an introduction
catherine_earnshaw told hareton_earnshaw who she was and where she was going and asked him to show her the way finally beguiling him to accompany her
he opened the mysteries of the fairy cave and twenty other queer places but being in disgrace i was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw
i could gather however that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant and mr_heathcliff housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin
then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart she who was always love and darling and queen and angel with everybody at the grange to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger
she did not comprehend it and hard work i had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father
i explained how he objected to the whole household at the heights and how sorry he would be to find she had been there but i insisted most on the fact that if she revealed my negligence of his orders he would perhaps be so angry that i should have to leave and miss_cathy couldnt bear that prospect
she pledged her word and kept it for my sake after all she was a sweet little girl chapter xix
isabella_linton was dead and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter and arrange a room and other accommodations for his youthful nephew
catherine_earnshaw ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her real cousin
since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs and now attired in her new black frock poor thing
her aunt death impressed her with no definite sorrow she obliged me by constant worrying to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them
mrs_linton_heathcliff is just six months younger than i am she chattered as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf under shadow of the trees
a letter edged with black announced the day of my master return the evening of their expected arrival came how delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow
i have it carefully preserved in a little glass box and i ve often thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner
aunt isabella_linton sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair it was lighter than mine more flaxen and quite as fine oh
she ran and returned and ran again many time before my sober footsteps reached the gate and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path and tried to wait patiently but that was impossible
i am happy and papa dear dear papa come ellen_dean let us run come run she couldnt be still a minute
how long they are she exclaimed ah i see some dust on the road they are coming no when will they be here
may we not go a little way half a mile ellen_dean only just half a mile do say yes to that clump of birches at the turn
i refused staunchly at length her suspense was ended the travelling carriage rolled in sight miss_cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her father face looking from the window
he descended nearly as eager as herself and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves
while they exchanged caresses i took a peep in to see after mrs_linton_heathcliff he was asleep in a corner wrapped in a warm fur lined cloak as if it had been winter
a pale delicate effeminate boy who might have been taken for my master younger brother so strong was the resemblance but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff never had
the latter saw me looking and having shaken hand advised me to close the door and leave him undisturbed for the journey had fatigued him
miss_cathy would fain have taken one glance but her father told her to come and they walked together up the park while i hastened before to prepare the servants
now darling said mr mrs_linton_heathcliff addressing his daughter as they halted at the bottom of the front steps your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are and he has lost his mother remember a very short time since therefore dont expect him to play and run about with you directly
and dont harass him much by talking let him be quiet this evening at least will you yes yes papa answered catherine_earnshaw
but i do want to see him and he hasnt once looked out the carriage stopped and the sleeper being roused was lifted to the ground by his uncle
this is your cousin miss_cathy mrs_linton_heathcliff he said putting their little hand together she fond of you already and mind you dont grieve her by crying to night
try to be cheerful now the travelling is at an end and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please
let me go to bed then answered the boy shrinking from catherine_earnshaw salute and he put his fingers to remove incipient tears
come come there a good child i whispered leading him in you ll make her weep too see how sorry she is for you
i do not know whether it was sorrow for him but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself and returned to her father
i proceeded to remove mrs_linton_heathcliff cap and mantle and placed him on a chair by the table but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh
all three entered and mounted to the library where tea was laid ready my master inquired what was the matter
i cant sit on a chair sobbed the boy go to the sofa then and ellen_dean shall bring you some tea answered his uncle patiently
he had been greatly tried during the journey i felt convinced by his fretful ailing charge mrs_linton_heathcliff slowly trailed himself off and lay down
at first she sat silent but that could not last she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin as she would have him to be and she commenced stroking his curls and kissing his cheek and offering him tea in her saucer like a baby
miss_cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side this pleased him for he was not much better he dried his eye and lightened into a faint smile
oh he ll do very well said the master to me after watching them a minute very well if we can keep him ellen_dean
the company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon and by wishing for strength he ll gain it
ay if we can keep him i mused to myself and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that
and then i thought how ever will that weakling live at wuthering heights between his father and hareton_earnshaw what playmates and instructors they ll be
i had just taken the child up stairs after tea was finished and seen mrs_linton_heathcliff asleep he would not suffer me to leave him till
i had come down and was standing by the table in the hall lighting a bedroom candle for mr_edgar when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that mr_heathcliff servant joseph was at the door and wished to speak with the master
our doubts were presently decided even earlier than i expected that was the case i shall ask him what he wants first i said in considerable trepidation
a very unlikely hour to be troubling people and the instant they have returned from a long journey i dont think the master can see him
he was donned in his sunday garments with his most sanctimonious and sourest face and holding his hat in one hand and his stick in the other he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat
joseph had advanced through the kitchen as i uttered these word and now presented himself in the hall good evening joseph i said coldly
what business brings you here to night it maister mrs_linton_heathcliff i mun spake to he answered waving me disdainfully aside
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff is going to bed unless you have something particular to say i sure he wont hear it now i continued
you had better sit down in there and entrust your message to me which is his rahm pursued the fellow surveying the range of closed door
i perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation so very reluctantly i went up to the library and announced the unseasonable visitor advising that he should be dismissed till next day
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff had no time to empower me to do so for joseph mounted close at my heels and pushing into the apartment planted himself at the far side of the table with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick and began in an elevated tone as if anticipating opposition hathecliff has sent me for his lad and i munnt goa back bout him
mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff was silent a minute an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features he would have pitied the child on his own account but recalling isabella_linton hopes and fears and anxious wishes for her son and her commendations of him to his care he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up and searched in his heart how it might be avoided
no plan offered itself the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory there was nothing left but to resign him
however he was not going to rouse him from his sleep tell mr_heathcliff he answered calmly that his son shall come to wuthering heights to morrow
you may also tell him that the mother of mrs_linton_heathcliff desired him to remain under my guardianship and at present his health is very precarious
he is in bed and too tired to go the distance now noa said joseph giving a thud with his prop on the floor and assuming an authoritative air
noa that means naught hathecliff maks noa count ot mother nor ye norther but he ll heu his lad und i mun tak him soa now ye knaw
you shall not to night answered mrs_linton_heathcliff decisively walk down stairs at once and repeat to your master what i have said
and aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm he rid the room of him and closed the door
ellen_dean show him down go varrah weell shouted joseph as he slowly drew off to morn he come hisseln and thrust him out if ye darr
to obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled mr mrs_linton_heathcliff commissioned me to take the boy home early on catherine_earnshaw pony and said he as we shall now have no influence over his destiny good or bad you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter she cannot associate with him hereafter and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity lest she should be restless and anxious to visit the heights
mrs_linton_heathcliff was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five clock and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling but i softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father mr_heathcliff who wished to see him so much he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey
chapter xx merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly and he has been obliged to leave us my father
he cried in strange perplexity mamma never told me i had a father where does he live i rather stay with uncle
he lives a little distance from the grange i replied just beyond those hills not so far but you may walk over here when you get hearty
and you should be glad to go home and to see him you must try to love him as you did your mother and then he will love you
but why have i not heard of him before asked mrs_linton_heathcliff why didnt mamma and he live together as other people do
he had business to keep him in the north i answered and your mother health required her to reside in the south
and why didnt mamma speak to me about him persevered the child she often talked of uncle and i learnt to love him long ago
how am i to love papa i dont know him oh all child love their parents i said your mother perhaps thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you
let us make haste an early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hour more sleep
is she to go with us he demanded the little girl i saw yesterday not now replied i is uncle he continued
no i shall be your companion there i said mrs_linton_heathcliff sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study
i attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing and i had to call for my master assistance in coaxing him out of bed
the poor thing was finally got off with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short that mr_edgar and miss_cathy would visit him and other promises equally ill founded which i invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way
i wont go without uncle he cried at length i cant tell where you mean to take me the pure heather scented air the bright sunshine and the gentle canter of minny relieved his despondency after a while
he began to put questions concerning his new home and its inhabitants with greater interest and liveliness is wuthering heights as pleasant a place as thrushcross_grange
he inquired turning to take a last glance into the valley whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue
it is not so buried in trees i replied and it is not quite so large but you can see the country beautifully all round and the air is healthier for you fresher and drier
you will perhaps think the building old and dark at first though it is a respectable house the next best in the neighbourhood
hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw that is miss_cathy other cousin and so yours in a manner will show you all the sweetest spots and you can bring a book in fine weather and make a green hollow your study and now and then your uncle may join you in a walk he does frequently walk out on the hills
and you will have such nice rambles on the moors and what is my father like he asked is he as young and handsome as uncle
he as young said i but he has black hair and eye and looks sterner and he is taller and bigger altogether
he ll not seem to you so gentle and kind at first perhaps because it is not his way still mind you be frank and cordial with him and naturally he ll be fonder of you than any uncle for you are his own black hair and eye mused mrs_linton_heathcliff
i answered not a morsel i thought surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion and his large languid eye his mother eye save that unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit how strange that he should never come to see mamma and me
i cant fancy him then i am not like him am i not much he murmured has he ever seen me
why master mrs_linton_heathcliff said i three hundred mile is a great distance and ten year seem very different in length to a grown up person compared with what they do to you
it is probable mr_heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer but never found a convenient opportunity and now it is too late
if he has i must have been a baby i remember not a single thing about him dont trouble him with questions on the subject it will disturb him for no good
the boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride till we halted before the farmhouse garden gate
he surveyed the carved front and low browed lattices the straggling gooseberry bushes and crooked firs with solemn intentness and then shook his head his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode
i watched to catch his impressions in his countenance but he had sense to postpone complaining there might be compensation within
before he dismounted i went and opened the door it was half past six the family had just finished breakfast the servant was clearing and wiping down the table
joseph stood by his master chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse and hareton_earnshaw was preparing for the hayfield
hallo nelly_dean said mr_heathcliff when he saw me i feared i should have to come down and fetch my property myself
you ve brought it have you let us see what we can make of it he got up and strode to the door hareton_earnshaw and joseph followed in gaping curiosity
poor mrs_linton_heathcliff ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three sure ly said joseph after a grave inspection he swopped wi ye
maister an yon his lass mr_heathcliff having stared his son into an ague of confusion uttered a scornful laugh god
what a beauty what a lovely charming thing he exclaimed hav nt they reared it on snails and sour milk nelly_dean
oh damn my soul but that worse than i expected and the devil knows i was not sanguine i bid the trembling and bewildered child get down and enter
he did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father speech or whether it were intended for him indeed he was not yet certain that the grim sneering stranger was his father
but he clung to me with growing trepidation and on mr_heathcliff taking a seat and bidding him come hither he hid his face on my shoulder and wept
tut tut said mr_heathcliff stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees and then holding up his head by the chin
none of that nonsense we re not going to hurt thee mrs_linton_heathcliff isnt that thy name thou art thy mother child entirely where is my share in thee puling chicken
he took off the boy cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls felt his slender arms and his small fingers during which examination mrs_linton_heathcliff ceased crying and lifted his great blue eye to inspect the inspector
do you know me asked mr_heathcliff having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble no said mrs_linton_heathcliff with a gaze of vacant fear
you ve heard of me i daresay no he replied again no what a shame of your mother never to waken your filial regard for me
you are my son then i ll tell you and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed
now dont wince and colour up though it is something to see you have not white blood be a good lad and i ll do for you
i guess you ll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the grange and this thing wont be settled while you linger about it
well replied i i hope you ll be kind to the boy mr_heathcliff or you ll not keep him long and he all you have akin in the wide world that you will ever know remember
nelly_dean if you be tired you may sit down if not get home again i ll be very kind to him you neednt fear he said laughing
only nobody else must be kind to him i jealous of monopolising his affection and to begin my kindness joseph bring the lad some breakfast
yes nell he added when they had departed my son is prospective owner of your place and i should not wish him to die till i was certain of being his successor
besides he mine and i want the triumph of seeing my descendant fairly lord of their estates my child hiring their child to till their father lands for wages
that is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp i despise him for himself and hate him for the memories he revives
but that consideration is sufficient he as safe with me and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own
i ve engaged a tutor also to come three time a week from twenty mile distance to teach him what he pleases to learn
i ve ordered hareton_earnshaw to obey him and in fact i ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him above his associates
i do regret however that he so little deserves the trouble if i wished any blessing in the world it was to find him a worthy object of pride and i bitterly disappointed with the whey faced whining wretch
while he was speaking joseph returned bearing a basin of milk porridge and placed it before mrs_linton_heathcliff who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion and affirmed he could not eat it
i saw the old man servant shared largely in his master scorn of the child though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart because mr_heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour
cannot ate it repeated he peering in mrs_linton_heathcliff face and subduing his voice to a whisper for fear of being overheard
but maister hareton_earnshaw nivir ate naught else when he wer a little un and what wer gooid enough for him gooid enough for ye i rayther think
hareton_earnshaw you infernal calf begone to your work i have a room up stairs furnished for him in handsome style i sha nt eat it
answered mrs_linton_heathcliff snappishly take it away joseph snatched up the food indignantly and brought it to us is there aught ails th victuals
he asked thrusting the tray under mr_heathcliff nose what should ail them he said wah answered joseph yon dainty chap says he cannut ate em
but i guess it raight his mother wer just soa we wer a most too mucky to sowt corn for makking her breead
dont mention his mother to me said the master angrily get him something that he can eat that all what is his usual food nelly_dean
i suggested boiled milk or tea and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some come i reflected his father selfishness may contribute to his comfort
he perceives his delicate constitution and the necessity of treating him tolerably i ll console mr_edgar by acquainting him with the turn mr_heathcliff humour has taken
having no excuse for lingering longer i slipped out while mrs_linton_heathcliff was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep dog
but he was too much on the alert to be cheated as i closed the door i heard a cry and a frantic repetition of the word dont leave me
i ll not stay here i ll not stay here then the latch was raised and fell they did not suffer him to come forth
we had sad work with little miss_cathy that day she rose in high glee eager to join her cousin and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that mr_edgar himself was obliged to soothe her by affirming he should come back soon he added however if i can get him and there were no hopes of that
this promise poorly pacified her but time was more potent and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when mrs_linton_heathcliff would return before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him
when i chanced to encounter the housekeeper of wuthering heights in paying business visits to gimmerton_kirk i used to ask how the young master got on for he lived almost as secluded as catherine_earnshaw herself and was never to be seen
i mounted minny and urged her to a trot and so my brief guardianship ended chapter xxi i could gather from her that he continued in weak health and was a tiresome inmate
she said mr_heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse though he took some trouble to conceal it he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together
there seldom passed much talk between them mrs_linton_heathcliff learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour or else lay in bed all day for he was constantly getting coughs and colds and aches and pains of some sort
and i never know such a fainthearted creature added the woman nor one so careful of hisseln he will go on if i leave the window open a bit late in the evening
and he must have a fire in the middle of summer and joseph bacca pipe is poison and he must always have sweets and dainties and always milk milk for ever heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter and there he ll sit wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at and if hareton_earnshaw for pity comes to amuse him
oh it killing a breath of night air hareton_earnshaw is not bad natured though he rough they re sure to part one swearing and the other crying
i believe the master would relish catherine_earnshaw thrashing him to a mummy if he were not his son and i certain he would be fit to turn him out of door if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln
but then he wont go into danger of temptation he never enters the parlour and should mrs_linton_heathcliff show those ways in the house where he is he sends him up stairs directly
i divined from this account that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young mr_heathcliff selfish and disagreeable if he were not so originally and my interest in him consequently decayed though still i was moved with a sense of grief at his lot and a wish that he had been left with us
mr_edgar encouraged me to gain information he thought a great deal about him i fancy and would have run some risk to see him and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village
she said he had only been twice on horseback accompanying his father and both time he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards
that housekeeper left if i recollect rightly two year after he came and another whom i did not know was her successor she lives there still
on the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing because it was also the anniversary of my late mistress death
her father invariably spent that day alone in the library and walked at dusk as far as gimmerton_kirk kirkyard where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight
time wore on at the grange in its former pleasant way till miss_cathy reached sixteen therefore catherine_earnshaw was thrown on her own resources for amusement
this twentieth of march was a beautiful spring day and when her father had retired my young lady came down dressed for going out and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor with me mr mrs_linton_heathcliff had given her leave if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour
i know where i wish to go where a colony of moor game are settled i want to see whether they have made their nests yet
so make haste ellen_dean she cried that must be a good distance up i answered they dont breed on the edge of the moor
no it not she said i ve gone very near with papa i put on my bonnet and sallied out thinking nothing more of the matter
she bounded before me and returned to my side and was off again like a young greyhound and at first i found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near and enjoying the sweet warm sunshine and watching her my pet and my delight with her golden ringlets flying loose behind and her bright cheek as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose and her eye radiant with cloudless pleasure
she was a happy creature and an angel in those days it a pity she could not be content well said i where are your moor game miss_cathy
we should be at them the grange park fence is a great way off now oh a little further only a little further ellen_dean was her answer continually
climb to that hillock pass that bank and by the time you reach the other side i shall have raised the birds
but there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass that at length i began to be weary and told her we must halt and retrace our steps
i shouted to her as she had outstripped me a long way she either did not hear or did not regard for she still sprang on and i was compelled to follow
finally she dived into a hollow and before i came in sight of her again she was two mile nearer wuthering heights than her own home and i beheld a couple of persons arrest her
one of whom i felt convinced was mr_heathcliff himself miss_cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering or at least hunting out the nests of the grouse
i ve neither taken any nor found any she said as i toiled to them expanding her hand in corroboration of the statement
i didnt mean to take them but papa told me there were quantities up here and i wished to see the eggs
mr_heathcliff glanced at me with an ill meaning smile expressing his acquaintance with the party and consequently his malevolence towards it and demanded who papa was
the heights were mr_heathcliff land and he was reproving the poacher mr mrs_linton_heathcliff of thrushcross_grange she replied i thought you did not know me or you wouldnt have spoken in that way
you suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected then he said sarcastically and what are you inquired catherine_earnshaw gazing curiously on the speaker
she pointed to hareton_earnshaw the other individual who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two year to his age he seemed as awkward and rough as ever
that man i ve seen before is he your son miss_cathy i interrupted it will be three hours instead of one that we are out presently
but i have one and you have seen him before too and though your nurse is in a hurry i think both you and she would be the better for a little rest
we really must go back no that man is not my son answered mr_heathcliff pushing me aside will you just turn this nab of heath and walk into my house
i whispered catherine_earnshaw that she mustnt on any account accede to the proposal it was entirely out of the question
you ll get home earlier for the ease and you shall receive a kind welcome why she asked aloud i tired of running and the ground is dewy i cant sit here
let us go ellen_dean besides he says i have seen his son he mistaken i think but i guess where he lives at the farmhouse i visited in coming from penistone crags
dont you i do come nelly_dean hold your tongue it will be a treat for her to look in on us
no she not going to any such place i cried struggling to release my arm which he had seized but she was almost at the door stones already scampering round the brow at full speed
hareton_earnshaw get forwards with the lass you shall walk with me nelly_dean her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her he shied off by the road side and vanished
and there she ll see mrs_linton_heathcliff and all will be told as soon as ever we return and i shall have the blame
i want her to see mrs_linton_heathcliff he answered he looking better these few days it not often he fit to be seen
and we ll soon persuade her to keep the visit secret where is the harm of it the harm of it is that her father would hate me if he found i suffered her to enter your house and i am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so i replied
mr_heathcliff it very wrong i continued you know you mean no good my design is as honest as possible i ll inform you of its whole scope he said
i acting generously to your master his young chit has no expectations and should she second my wishes she ll be provided for at once as joint successor with mrs_linton_heathcliff
that the two cousins may fall in love and get married if mrs_linton_heathcliff died i answered and his life is quite uncertain catherine_earnshaw would be the heir
there is no clause in the will to secure it so his property would go to me but to prevent disputes i desire their union and am resolved to bring it about
no she would not he said and i resolved she shall never approach your house with me again i returned as we reached the gate where miss_cathy waited our coming
my young lady gave him several looks as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him but now he smiled when he met her eye and softened his voice in addressing her and i was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury
mr_heathcliff bade me be quiet and preceding us up the path hastened to open the door mrs_linton_heathcliff stood on the hearth
he had been out walking in the fields for his cap was on and he was calling to joseph to bring him dry shoes
his features were pretty yet and his eye and complexion brighter than i remembered them though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun
he had grown tall of his age still wanting some months of sixteen now who is that asked mr_heathcliff turning to miss_cathy
can you tell your son she said having doubtfully surveyed first one and then the other yes yes answered he but is this the only time you have beheld him
think ah you have a short memory mrs_linton_heathcliff dont you recall your cousin that you used to tease us so with wishing to see
what mrs_linton_heathcliff cried miss_cathy kindling into joyful surprise at the name is that little mrs_linton_heathcliff he taller than i am
the youth stepped forward and acknowledged himself she kissed him fervently and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each
catherine_earnshaw had reached her full height her figure was both plump and slender elastic as steel and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits
mrs_linton_heathcliff looks and movements were very languid and his form extremely slight but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects and rendered him not unpleasing
after exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him his cousin went to mr_heathcliff who lingered by the door dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without pretending that is to observe the latter and really noting the former alone
are you mrs_linton_heathcliff and you are my uncle then she cried reaching up to salute him i thought i liked you though you were cross at first
to live all these year such close neighbours and never see us is odd what have you done so for
why dont you visit at the grange with mrs_linton_heathcliff i visited it once or twice too often before you were born he answered
there damn it if you have any kisses to spare give them to mrs_linton_heathcliff they are thrown away on me naughty ellen_dean exclaimed catherine_earnshaw flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses
wicked ellen_dean to try to hinder me from entering but i ll take this walk every morning in future may i uncle and sometimes bring papa
of course replied the uncle with a hardly suppressed grimace resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors
wont you be glad to see us but stay he continued turning towards the young lady now i think of it i better tell you
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff has a prejudice against me we quarrelled at one time of our lives with unchristian ferocity and if you mention coming here to him he ll put a veto on your visits altogether
unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter you may come if you will but you must not mention it
he thought me too poor to wed his sister answered mr_heathcliff and was grieved that i got her his pride was hurt and he ll never forgive it
therefore you must not mention it why did you quarrel asked catherine_earnshaw considerably crestfallen that wrong said the young lady some time i ll tell him so
but mrs_linton_heathcliff and i have no share in your quarrel i ll not come here then he shall come to the grange
it will be too far for me murmured her cousin to walk four mile would kill me no come here miss catherine_earnshaw now and then not every morning but once or twice a week
the father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt i am afraid nelly_dean i shall lose my labour he muttered to me
miss catherine_earnshaw as the ninny calls her will discover his value and send him to the devil now if it had been hareton_earnshaw do you know that twenty time a day i covet hareton_earnshaw with all his degradation
i have loved the lad had he been some one else but i think he safe from her love i ll pit him against that paltry creature unless it bestir itself briskly
we calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen oh confound the vapid thing he absorbed in drying his feet and never looks at her mrs_linton_heathcliff
yes father answered the boy have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about not even a rabbit or a weasel nest
take her into the garden before you change your shoes and into the stable to see your horse wouldnt you rather sit here asked mrs_linton_heathcliff addressing miss_cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again
i dont know she replied casting a longing look to the door and evidently eager to be active he kept his seat and shrank closer to the fire
mr_heathcliff rose and went into the kitchen and from thence to the yard calling out for hareton_earnshaw hareton responded and presently the two re entered
the young man had been washing himself as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair
oh i ll ask you uncle cried miss_cathy recollecting the housekeeper assertion that is not my cousin is he
yes he replied your mother nephew dont you like him catherine_earnshaw looked queer is he not a handsome lad he continued
he laughed hareton_earnshaw darkened i perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority
the uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe and whispered a sentence in mr_heathcliff ear but his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming you ll be the favourite among us hareton_earnshaw
she says you are a what was it well something very flattering here you go with her round the farm and behave like a gentleman mind
dont use any bad word and dont stare when the young lady is not looking at you and be ready to hide your face when she is and when you speak say your word slowly and keep your hand out of your pockets
be off and entertain her as nicely as you can he watched the couple walking past the window catherine_earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion
he seemed studying the familiar landscape with a stranger and an artist interest catherine_earnshaw took a sly look at him expressing small admiration
she then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself and tripped merrily on lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation
i ve tied his tongue observed mr_heathcliff he ll not venture a single syllable all the time nelly_dean you recollect me at his age nay
some year younger did i ever look so stupid so gaumless as joseph calls it worse i replied because more sullen with it
i ve a pleasure in him he continued reflecting aloud he has satisfied my expectations if he were a born fool i should not enjoy it half so much
but he no fool and i can sympathise with all his feelings having felt them myself i know what he suffers now for instance exactly it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer though
i ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me and lower for he takes a pride in his brutishness
and he ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance i ve taught him to scorn everything extra animal as silly and weak
dont you think mr_hindley would be proud of his son if he could see him almost as proud as i am of mine
but there this difference one is gold put to the use of paving stones and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver
mine has nothing valuable about it yet i shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go
his had first rate qualities and they are lost rendered worse than unavailing i have nothing to regret he would have more than any
but i are aware of and the best of it is hareton_earnshaw is damnably fond of me you ll own that i ve outmatched mr_hindley there
if the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring wrongs i should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world
meantime our young companion who sat too removed from us to hear what was said began to evince symptoms of uneasiness probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of catherine_earnshaw society for fear of a little fatigue
mr_heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea i made no reply because i saw that he expected none his father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap
get up you idle boy he exclaimed with assumed heartiness away after them they are just at the corner by the stand of hives
the lattice was open and as he stepped out i heard miss_cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door
mrs_linton_heathcliff gathered his energies and left the hearth hareton_earnshaw stared up and scratched his head like a true clown it some damnable writing he answered
i cannot read it cant read it cried catherine_earnshaw i can read it it english but i want to know why it is there
mrs_linton_heathcliff giggled the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited he does not know his letters he said to his cousin
could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce is he all as he should be asked miss_cathy seriously or is he simple not right
i ve questioned him twice now and each time he looked so stupid i think he does not understand me i can hardly understand him i sure
mrs_linton_heathcliff repeated his laugh and glanced at hareton_earnshaw tauntingly who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment
there nothing the matter but laziness is there catherine_earnshaw he said my cousin fancies you are an idiot there you experience the consequence of scorning book larning as you would say
have you noticed catherine_earnshaw his frightful yorkshire pronunciation why where the devil is the use ont growled hareton_earnshaw more ready in answering his daily companion
he was about to enlarge further but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement
where is the use of the devil in that sentence tittered mrs_linton_heathcliff papa told you not to say any bad word and you cant open your mouth without one
if thou werent more a lass than a lad i fell thee this minute i would pitiful lath of a crater retorted the angry boor retreating while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification
do try to behave like a gentleman now do for he was conscious of being insulted and embarrassed how to resent it
mr_heathcliff having overheard the conversation as well as i smiled when he saw him go but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair who remained chattering in the door way the boy finding animation enough while discussing hareton_earnshaw faults and deficiencies and relating anecdotes of his goings on and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings without considering the ill nature they evinced
i began to dislike more than to compassionate mrs_linton_heathcliff and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap
we stayed till afternoon i could not tear miss_cathy away sooner but happily my master had not quitted his apartment and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence
as we walked home i would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted but she got it into her head that i was prejudiced against them
you are partial i know or else you wouldnt have cheated me so many year into the notion that mrs_linton_heathcliff lived a long way from here
but you must hold your tongue about my uncle he my uncle remember and i ll scold papa for quarrelling with him
aha she cried you take papa side ellen_dean i really extremely angry only i so pleased i cant show it and so she ran on till i relinquished the endeavour to convince her of her mistake
she did not mention the visit that night because she did not see mr mrs_linton_heathcliff next day it all came out sadly to my chagrin and still i was not altogether sorry
but he was too timid in giving satisfactory reason for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the heights and catherine_earnshaw liked good reason for every restraint that harassed her petted will
i thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me papa she exclaimed after the morning salutations guess whom i saw yesterday in my walk on the moors
i saw but listen and you shall hear how i found you out and ellen_dean who is in league with you and yet pretended to pity me so when i kept hoping and was always disappointed about mrs_linton_heathcliff coming back
she gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences and my master though he cast more than one reproachful look at me said nothing till she had concluded
ah papa you started you ve not done right have you now then he drew her to him and asked if she knew why he had concealed mrs_linton_heathcliff near neighbourhood from her
could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy it was because you disliked mr_heathcliff she answered
no it was not because i disliked mr_heathcliff but because mr_heathcliff dislikes me and is a most diabolical man delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates if they give him the slightest opportunity
i knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him and i knew he would detest you on my account so for your own good and nothing else i took precautions that you should not see mrs_linton_heathcliff again
then you believe i care more for my own feelings than yours miss_cathy he said i meant to explain this some time as you grew older and i sorry
but mr_heathcliff was quite cordial papa observed catherine_earnshaw not at all convinced and he didnt object to our seeing each other he said i might come to his house when i pleased only i must not tell you because you had quarrelled with him and would not forgive him for marrying aunt isabella_linton
you are the one to be blamed he is willing to let us be friends at least mrs_linton_heathcliff and i and you are not
my master perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle in law evil disposition gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to isabella_linton and the manner in which wuthering heights became his property
he could not bear to discourse long upon the topic for though he spoke little of it he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since mrs_linton_heathcliff death
she might have been living yet if it had not been for him was his constant bitter reflection and in his eye mr_heathcliff seemed a murderer
miss_cathy conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience injustice and passion arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness and repented of on the day they were committed was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for year and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse
she appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human nature excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till now that mr_edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject
he merely added you will know hereafter darling why i wish you to avoid his house and family now return to your old employments and amusements and think no more about them
catherine_earnshaw kissed her father and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours according to custom then she accompanied him into the grounds and the whole day passed as usual but in the evening when she had retired to her room and i went to help her to undress i found her crying on her knees by the bedside
i delayed it and you wont oh fie silly child i exclaimed if you had any real griefs you be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety
you never had one shadow of substantial sorrow miss catherine_earnshaw suppose for a minute that master and i were dead and you were by yourself in the world
compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that and be thankful for the friends you have instead of coveting more
he expected to see me again to morrow and there he ll be so disappointed and he ll wait for me and i sha nt come
how would you feel then i not crying for myself ellen_dean she answered it for him nonsense said i do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him
hasnt he hareton_earnshaw for a companion not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice for two afternoons
mrs_linton_heathcliff will conjecture how it is and trouble himself no further about you but may i not write a note to tell him why i cannot come
his books are not as nice as mine and he wanted to have them extremely when i told him how interesting they were
she asked rising to her feet and just send those books i promised to lend him may i not ellen_dean
no indeed no indeed replied i with decision then he would write to you and there never be an end of it
no miss catherine_earnshaw the acquaintance must be dropped entirely so papa expects and i shall see that it is done
but how can one little note she recommenced putting on an imploring countenance silence i interrupted we ll not begin with your little notes
get into bed she threw at me a very naughty look so naughty that i would not kiss her good night at first
there was miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance
you ll get nobody to take that catherine_earnshaw i said if you write it and at present i shall put out your candle
i set the extinguisher on the flame receiving as i did so a slap on my hand and a petulant cross thing
i covered her up and shut her door in great displeasure but repenting half way i returned softly and lo i then quitted her again and she drew the bolt in one of her worst most peevish humours
the letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk fetcher who came from the village but that i didnt learn till some time afterwards
weeks passed on and miss_cathy recovered her temper though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself and often if i came near her suddenly while reading she would start and bend over the book evidently desirous to hide it and i detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves
she also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen as if she were expecting the arrival of something and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library which she would trifle over for hours and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it
one day as she inspected this drawer i observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper
my curiosity and suspicions were roused i determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures so at night as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs i searched and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock
having opened i emptied the whole contents into my apron and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber
though i could not but suspect i was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondence daily almost it must have been from mrs_linton_heathcliff mr_heathcliff answers to documents forwarded by her
the earlier dated were embarrassed and short gradually however they expanded into copious love letters foolish as the age of the writer rendered natural yet with touches here and there which i thought were borrowed from a more experienced source
some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness commencing in strong feeling and concluding in the affected wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied incorporeal sweetheart
after turning over as many as i thought proper i tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside relocking the vacant drawer
following her habit my young lady descended early and visited the kitchen i watched her go to the door on the arrival of a certain little boy and while the dairymaid filled his can she tucked something into his jacket pocket and plucked something out
i went round by the garden and laid wait for the messenger who fought valorously to defend his trust and we spilt the milk between us but i succeeded in abstracting the epistle and threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home
whether they satisfied miss_cathy i dont know but they appeared very worthless trash to me i remained under the wall and perused miss_cathy affectionate composition
it was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin very pretty and very silly i shook my head and went meditating into the house
the day being wet she could not divert herself with rambling about the park so at the conclusion of her morning studies she resorted to the solace of the drawer
her father sat reading at the table and i on purpose had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window curtain keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings
never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it had left brimful of chirping young ones express more complete despair in its anguished cries and flutterings than she by her single oh
and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance mr mrs_linton_heathcliff looked up what is the matter love have you hurt yourself
he said his tone and look assured her he had not been the discoverer of the hoard no papa she gasped
ellen_dean ellen_dean come up stairs i sick i obeyed her summons and accompanied her out oh ellen_dean you have got them she commenced immediately dropping on her knees when we were enclosed alone
oh give them to me and i ll never never do so again dont tell papa you have not told papa ellen_dean say you have not
i ve been exceedingly naughty but i wont do it any more with a grave severity in my manner i bade her stand up
a fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours to be sure why it good enough to be printed
so i exclaimed miss catherine_earnshaw you are tolerably far on it seems you may well be ashamed of them and what do you suppose the master will think when i display it before him
i hav nt shown it yet but you neednt imagine i shall keep your ridiculous secrets for shame and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities he would not have thought of beginning i certain
i didnt i didnt sobbed miss_cathy fit to break her heart i didnt once think of loving him till loving
cried i as scornfully as i could utter the word loving did anybody ever hear the like i might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn
pretty loving indeed and both time together you have seen mrs_linton_heathcliff hardly four hours in your life now here is the babyish trash
she sprang at her precious epistles but i held them above my head and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that i would burn them do anything rather than show them
and being really fully as much inclined to laugh as scold for i esteemed it all girlish vanity i at length relented in a measure and asked if i consent to burn them will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again nor a book for i perceive you have sent him books nor locks of hair nor rings nor playthings
i going with it to the library and we ll see what your father says to such loving we dont send playthings cried catherine_earnshaw her pride overcoming her shame
nor anything at all then my lady i said unless you will here i go i promise ellen_dean she cried catching my dress
oh put them in the fire do do but when i proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne
she earnestly supplicated that i would spare her one or two one or two ellen_dean to keep for mrs_linton_heathcliff sake
i unknotted the handkerchief and commenced dropping them in from an angle and the flame curled up the chimney i will have one you cruel wretch
she screamed darting her hand into the fire and drawing forth some half consumed fragments at the expense of her fingers
very well and i will have some to exhibit to papa i answered shaking back the rest into the bundle and turning anew to the door
it was done i stirred up the ashes and interred them under a shovelful of coals and she mutely and with a sense of intense injury retired to her private apartment
i descended to tell my master that the young lady qualm of sickness was almost gone but i judged it best for her to lie down a while
she emptied her blackened pieces into the flames and motioned me to finish the immolation she wouldnt dine but she reappeared at tea pale and red about the eye and marvellously subdued in outward aspect
next morning i answered the letter by a slip of paper inscribed master mr_heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to miss mrs_linton_heathcliff as she will not receive them
chapter xxii summer drew to an end and early autumn it was past michaelmas but the harvest was late that year and a few of our fields were still uncleared
mr mrs_linton_heathcliff and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk and the evening happening to be chill and damp my master caught a bad cold that settled obstinately on his lungs and confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter nearly without intermission
poor miss_cathy frightened from her little romance had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment and her father insisted on her reading less and taking more exercise
she had his companionship no longer i esteemed it a duty to supply its lack as much as possible with mine
an inefficient substitute for i could only spare two or three hours from my numerous diurnal occupation to follow her footsteps
on an afternoon in october or the beginning of november a fresh watery afternoon when the turf and paths were rustling with moist withered leaves and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds dark grey streamers rapidly mounting from the west and boding abundant rain i requested my young lady to forego her ramble because i was certain of showers
she refused and i unwillingly donned a cloak and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park a formal walk which she generally affected if low spirited and that she invariably was when mr_edgar had been worse than ordinary a thing never known from his confession but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance
she went sadly on there was no running or bounding now though the chill wind might well have tempted her to race
and often from the side of my eye i could detect her raising a hand and brushing something off her cheek
and henceforth the little boy came with vacant pockets and then my society was obviously less desirable than his i gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts
on one side of the road rose a high rough bank where hazels and stunted oaks with their roots half exposed held uncertain tenure the soil was too loose for the latter and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal
in summer miss catherine_earnshaw delighted to climb along these trunks and sit in the branches swinging twenty feet above the ground and i pleased with her agility and her light childish heart still considered it proper to scold every time i caught her at such an elevation but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending
from dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze rocked cradle doing nothing except singing old songs my nursery lore to herself or watching the birds joint tenant feed and entice their young ones to fly or nestling with closed lids half thinking half dreaming happier than word can express
look miss i exclaimed pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree winter is not here yet
there a little flower up yonder the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in july with a lilac mist
miss_cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter and replied at length no i ll not touch it but it looks melancholy does it not ellen_dean
yes i observed about as starved and suckless as you your cheeks are bloodless let us take hold of hand and run
will you clamber up and pluck it to show to papa you re so low i daresay i shall keep up with you
no she repeated and continued sauntering on pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss or a tuft of blanched grass or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage and ever and anon her hand was lifted to her averted face
catherine_earnshaw why are you crying love i asked approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder you mustnt cry because papa has a cold be thankful it is nothing worse
she now put no further restraint on her tears her breath was stifled by sobs oh it will be something worse she said
and what shall i do when papa and you leave me and i am by myself i cant forget your word ellen_dean they are always in my ear
how life will be changed how dreary the world will be when papa and you are dead none can tell whether you wont die before us i replied
it wrong to anticipate evil we ll hope there are year and year to come before any of us go master is young and i am strong and hardly forty five
my mother lived till eighty a canty dame to the last and suppose mr mrs_linton_heathcliff were spared till he saw sixty that would be more year than you have counted
miss and would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty year beforehand but aunt isabella_linton was younger than papa she remarked gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation
aunt isabella_linton had not you and me to nurse her i replied she wasnt as happy as master she hadnt as much to live for
all you need do is to wait well on your father and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject mind that miss_cathy
i ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless and cherished a foolish fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make
i fret about nothing on earth except papa illness answered my companion i care for nothing in comparison with papa
and i ll never never oh never while i have my senses do an act or say a word to vex him i love him better than myself ellen_dean and i know it by this
i pray every night that i may live after him because i would rather be miserable than that he should be that proves i love him better than myself good word i replied
but deeds must prove it also and after he is well remember you dont forget resolution formed in the hour of fear
as we talked we neared a door that opened on the road and my young lady lightening into sunshine again climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild rose trees shadowing the highway side the lower fruit had disappeared but only birds could touch the upper except from miss_cathy present station
in stretching to pull them her hat fell off and as the door was locked she proposed scrambling down to recover it
but the return was no such easy matter the stones were smooth and neatly cemented and the rose bushes and black berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re ascending
i bid her be cautious lest she got a fall and she nimbly disappeared i like a fool didnt recollect that till i heard her laughing and exclaiming ellen_dean
you ll have to fetch the key or else i must run round to the porter lodge i cant scale the ramparts on this side
stay where you are i answered i have my bundle of keys in my pocket perhaps i may manage to open it if not i ll go
i had applied the last and found that none would do so repeating my desire that she would remain there i was about to hurry home as fast as i could when an approaching sound arrested me
catherine_earnshaw amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door while i tried all the large keys in succession it was the trot of a horse miss_cathy dance stopped also
who is that i whispered ellen_dean i wish you could open the door whispered back my companion anxiously ho miss mrs_linton_heathcliff cried a deep voice the rider i glad to meet you
dont be in haste to enter for i have an explanation to ask and obtain i sha nt speak to you mr_heathcliff answered catherine_earnshaw
papa says you are a wicked man and you hate both him and me and ellen_dean says the same that is nothing to the purpose said mr_heathcliff
he it was i dont hate my son i suppose and it is concerning him that i demand your attention
yes you have cause to blush two or three months since were you not in the habit of writing to mrs_linton_heathcliff making love in play eh
you deserved both of you flogging for that you especially the elder and less sensitive as it turns out i ve got your letters and if you give me any pertness i ll send them to your father
i presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it didnt you well you dropped mrs_linton_heathcliff with it into a slough of despond
he was in earnest in love really as true as i live he dying for you breaking his heart at your fickleness not figuratively but actually
though hareton_earnshaw has made him a standing jest for six weeks and i have used more serious measures and attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy he gets worse daily and he ll be under the sod before summer unless you restore him
how can you lie so glaringly to the poor child i called from the inside pray ride on how can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods
miss_cathy i ll knock the lock off with a stone you wont believe that vile nonsense you can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger
i was not aware there were eavesdroppers muttered the detected villain worthy mrs ellen_dean i like you but i dont like your double dealing he added aloud
how could you lie so glaringly as to affirm i hated the poor child and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door stones
catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff the very name warms me my bonny lass i shall be from home all this week go and see if have not spoken truth do there a darling
just imagine your father in my place and mrs_linton_heathcliff in yours then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you when your father himself entreated him and dont from pure stupidity fall into the same error
i swear on my salvation he going to his grave and none but you can save him the lock gave way and i issued out
i swear mrs_linton_heathcliff is dying repeated mr_heathcliff looking hard at me and grief and disappointment are hastening his death nelly_dean if you wont let her go you can walk over yourself
but i shall not return till this time next week and i think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin come in said i taking miss_cathy by the arm and half forcing her to re enter for she lingered viewing with troubled eye the features of the speaker too stern to express his inward deceit
he pushed his horse close and bending down observed miss catherine_earnshaw i ll own to you that i have little patience with mrs_linton_heathcliff and hareton_earnshaw and joseph have less
i ll own that he with a harsh set he pines for kindness as well as love and a kind word from you would be his best medicine
he dreams of you day and night and cannot be persuaded that you dont hate him since you neither write nor call
i closed the door and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it and spreading my umbrella i drew my charge underneath for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees and warned us to avoid delay
our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with mr_heathcliff as we stretched towards home but i divined instinctively that catherine_earnshaw heart was clouded now in double darkness
her features were so sad they did not seem hers she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true
dont mind mrs ellen_dean cruel cautions but be generous and contrive to see him the master had retired to rest before we came in
miss_cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was he had fallen asleep she returned and asked me to sit with her in the library
we took our tea together and afterwards she lay down on the rug and told me not to talk for she was weary
as soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation she recommenced her silent weeping it appeared at present her favourite diversion
i suffered her to enjoy it a while then i expostulated deriding and ridiculing all mr_heathcliff assertions about his son as if i were certain she would coincide
i got a book and pretended to read alas i hadnt skill to counteract the effect his account had produced it was just what he intended
and i must tell mrs_linton_heathcliff it is not my fault that i dont write and convince him that i shall not change
you may be right ellen_dean she answered but i shall never feel at ease till i know what use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity
we parted that night hostile but next day beheld me on the road to wuthering heights by the side of my wilful young mistress pony
i couldnt bear to witness her sorrow to see her pale dejected countenance and heavy eye and i yielded in the faint hope that mrs_linton_heathcliff himself might prove by his reception of us how little of the tale was founded on fact
chapter xxiii the rainy night had ushered in a misty morning half frost half drizzle and temporary brooks crossed our path gurgling from the uplands
my feet were thoroughly wetted i was cross and low exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things
we entered the farm house by the kitchen way to ascertain whether mr_heathcliff were really absent because i put slight faith in his own affirmation
joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone beside a roaring fire a quart of ale on the table near him bristling with large pieces of toasted oat cake and his black short pipe in his mouth
catherine_earnshaw ran to the hearth to warm herself i asked if the master was in my question remained so long unanswered that i thought the old man had grown deaf and repeated it louder
na ay he snarled or rather screamed through his nose na ay yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough joseph cried a peevish voice simultaneously with me from the inner room
how often am i to call you there are only a few red ashes now joseph come this moment vigorous puffs and a resolute stare into the grate declared he had no ear for this appeal
the housekeeper and hareton_earnshaw were invisible one gone on an errand and the other at his work probably we knew mrs_linton_heathcliff tones and entered
oh i hope you ll die in a garret starved to death said the boy mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant
he stopped on observing his error his cousin flew to him is that you miss mrs_linton_heathcliff he said raising his head from the arm of the great chair in which he reclined
papa said you would call continued he after recovering a little from catherine_earnshaw embrace while she stood by looking very contrite
no dont kiss me it takes my breath dear me will you shut the door if you please you left it open and those those detestable creatures wont bring coals to the fire
the invalid complained of being covered with ashes but he had a tiresome cough and looked feverish and ill so i did not rebuke his temper
it so cold i stirred up the cinders and fetched a scuttleful myself well mrs_linton_heathcliff murmured catherine_earnshaw when his corrugated brow relaxed are you glad to see me
can i do you any good why didnt you come before he asked you should have come instead of writing
it tired me dreadfully writing those long letters i far rather have talked to you now i can neither bear to talk nor anything else
i wonder where zillah is will you looking at me step into the kitchen and see i had received no thanks for my other service and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest
i replied nobody is out there but joseph i want to drink he exclaimed fretfully turning away zillah is constantly gadding off to gimmerton_kirk since papa went it miserable
and i obliged to come down here they resolved never to hear me up stairs is your father attentive to you master mr_heathcliff
i asked perceiving catherine_earnshaw to be checked in her friendly advances attentive he makes them a little more attentive at least he cried
the wretches do you know miss mrs_linton_heathcliff that brute hareton_earnshaw laughs at me i hate him indeed i hate them all they are odious beings
he bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table and having swallowed a small portion appeared more tranquil and said she was very kind
and are you glad to see me asked she reiterating her former question and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile
miss_cathy began searching for some water she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser filled a tumbler and brought it yes i am
it something new to hear a voice like yours he replied but i have been vexed because you wouldnt come
and papa swore it was owing to me he called me a pitiful shuffling worthless thing and said you despised me and if he had been in my place he would be more the master of the grange than your father by this time
but you dont despise me do you miss i wish you would say catherine_earnshaw or miss_cathy interrupted my young lady
i dont love mr_heathcliff though and i dare not come when he returns will he stay away many days not many answered mrs_linton_heathcliff but he goes on to the moors frequently since the shooting season commenced and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence
i think i should not be peevish with you you not provoke me and you always be ready to help me wouldnt you
yes said catherine_earnshaw stroking his long soft hair if i could only get papa consent i spend half my time with you
despise you no next to papa and ellen_dean i love you better than anybody living do say you will pretty mrs_linton_heathcliff
i wish you were my brother and then you would like me as well as your father observed he more cheerfully
but papa says you would love me better than him and all the world if you were my wife so i rather you were that
and people hate their wives sometimes but not their sisters and brothers and if you were the latter you would live with us and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me
mrs_linton_heathcliff denied that people ever hated their wives but miss_cathy affirmed they did and in her wisdom instanced his own father aversion to her aunt
no i should never love anybody better than papa she returned gravely i endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue i couldnt succeed till everything she knew was out
master mr_heathcliff much irritated asserted her relation was false papa told me and papa does not tell falsehoods she answered pertly
my papa scorns yours cried mrs_linton_heathcliff he calls him a sneaking fool yours is a wicked man retorted catherine_earnshaw and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says
he must be wicked to have made aunt isabella_linton leave him as she did she didnt leave him said the boy you sha nt contradict me
she did cried my young lady well i ll tell you something said mrs_linton_heathcliff your mother hated your father now then
oh exclaimed catherine_earnshaw too enraged to continue and she loved mine added he you little liar i hate you now
sang mrs_linton_heathcliff sinking into the recess of his chair and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant who stood behind
she panted and her face grew red with passion she did she did hush master mr_heathcliff i said that your father tale too i suppose
it isnt you hold your tongue he answered she did she did catherine_earnshaw she did she did miss_cathy beside herself gave the chair a violent push and caused him to fall against one arm
he was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph it lasted so long that it frightened even me
as to his cousin she wept with all her might aghast at the mischief she had done though she said nothing
i held him till the fit exhausted itself then he thrust me away and leant his head down silently catherine_earnshaw quelled her lamentations also took a seat opposite and looked solemnly into the fire
how do you feel now master mr_heathcliff i inquired after waiting ten minutes i wish she felt as i do he replied spiteful cruel thing
hareton_earnshaw never touches me he never struck me in his life and i was better to day and there his voice died in a whimper
he sighed and moaned like one under great suffering and kept it up for a quarter of an hour on purpose to distress his cousin apparently for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her
i didnt strike you muttered miss_cathy chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice
but i couldnt have been hurt by that little push and i had no idea that you could either you re not much are you mrs_linton_heathcliff
i sorry i hurt you mrs_linton_heathcliff she said at length racked beyond endurance dont let me go home thinking i ve done you harm
i cant speak to you he murmured you ve hurt me so that i shall lie awake all night choking with this cough
if you had it you know what it was but you ll be comfortably asleep while i in agony and nobody near me
answer speak to me i wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights and he began to wail aloud for very pity of himself
since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights i said it wont be miss who spoils your ease you be the same had she never come
however she shall not disturb you again and perhaps you ll get quieter when we leave you must i go asked catherine_earnshaw dolefully bending over him
you cant alter what you ve done he replied pettishly shrinking from her unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever
do you want me to go mrs_linton_heathcliff well then i must go she repeated let me alone at least said he i cant bear your talking
she lingered and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while but as he neither looked up nor spoke she finally made a movement to the door and i followed
mrs_linton_heathcliff had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can
we were recalled by a scream i thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him
not so my companion she ran back in terror knelt down and cried and soothed and entreated till he grew quiet from lack of breath by no means from compunction at distressing her
i shall lift him on to the settle i said and he may roll about as he pleases we cant stop to watch him
i hope you are satisfied miss_cathy that you are not the person to benefit him and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you
come away as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense he ll be glad to lie still
she placed a cushion under his head and offered him some water he rejected the latter and tossed uneasily on the former as if it were a stone or a block of wood
now then there he is she tried to put it more comfortably i cant do with that he said it not high enough
catherine_earnshaw brought another to lay above it that too high murmured the provoking thing how must i arrange it then
he twined himself up to her as she half knelt by the settle and converted her shoulder into a support
she asked despairingly no that wont do i said you ll be content with the cushion master mr_heathcliff miss has wasted too much time on you already we cannot remain five minutes longer
he beginning to think i shall have far greater misery than he will to night if i believe he is the worse for my visit and then i dare not come again
yes yes we can replied miss_cathy he good and patient now tell the truth about it mrs_linton_heathcliff for i musnt come if i have hurt you
you must come to cure me he answered you ought to come because you have hurt me you know you have extremely
i was not as ill when you entered as i am at present was i but you ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion i didnt do it all said his cousin
however we ll be friends now and you want me you would wish to see me sometimes really i told you i did he replied impatiently
sit quite still and dont talk but you may sing a song if you can sing or you may say a nice long interesting ballad one of those you promised to teach me or a story
sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee that as mamma used to do whole afternoons together i rather have a ballad though begin
mrs_linton_heathcliff would have another and after that another notwithstanding my strenuous objections and so they went on until the clock struck twelve and we heard hareton_earnshaw in the court returning for his dinner
catherine_earnshaw repeated the longest she could remember the employment pleased both mightily and to morrow catherine_earnshaw will you be here to morrow asked young mr_heathcliff holding her frock as she rose reluctantly
no i answered nor next day neither she however gave a different response evidently for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear
you wont go to morrow recollect miss i commenced when we were out of the house you are not dreaming of it are you
she smiled oh i ll take good care i continued i ll have that lock mended and you can escape by no way else
i can get over the wall she said laughing the grange is not a prison ellen_dean and you are not my gaoler
and besides i almost seventeen i a woman and i certain mrs_linton_heathcliff would recover quickly if he had me to look after him
i older than he is you know and wiser less childish am i not and he ll soon do as i direct him with some slight coaxing
he a pretty little darling when he good i make such a pet of him if he were mine we should never quarrel should we after we were used to each other
dont you like him ellen_dean like him i exclaimed the worst tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens
happily as mr_heathcliff conjectured he ll not win twenty i doubt whether he ll see spring indeed and small loss to his family whenever he drops off
and lucky it is for us that his father took him the kinder he was treated the more tedious and selfish he be
i glad you have no chance of having him for a husband miss catherine_earnshaw my companion waxed serious at hearing this speech
he younger than i she answered after a protracted pause of meditation and he ought to live the longest he will he must live as long as i do
to speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings he as strong now as when he first came into the north i positive of that
it only a cold that ails him the same as papa has you say papa will get better and why shouldnt he
well well i cried after all we neednt trouble ourselves for listen miss and mind i ll keep my word if you attempt going to wuthering heights again with or without me i shall inform mr mrs_linton_heathcliff and unless he allow it the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived
it has been revived muttered miss_cathy sulkily must not be continued then i said we ll see was her reply and she set off at a gallop leaving me to toil in the rear
we both reached home before our dinner time my master supposed we had been wandering through the park and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence
as soon as i entered i hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings but sitting such awhile at the heights had done the mischief
on the succeeding morning i was laid up and during three weeks i remained incapacitated for attending to my duties a calamity never experienced prior to that period and never i am thankful to say since
my little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me and cheer my solitude the confinement brought me exceedingly low
it is wearisome to a stirring active body but few have slighter reason for complaint than i had the moment catherine_earnshaw left mr mrs_linton_heathcliff room
her day was divided between us no amusement usurped a minute she neglected her meals her studies and her play and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched
she appeared at my bedside she must have had a warm heart when she loved her father so to give so much to me
i said her days were divided between us but the master retired early and i generally needed nothing after six clock thus the evening was her own
and though frequently when she looked in to bid me good night i remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers instead of fancying the line borrowed from a cold ride across the moors i laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library
poor thing i never considered what she did with herself after tea chapter xxiv at the close of three weeks i was able to quit my chamber and move about the house
and on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening i asked catherine_earnshaw to read to me because my eye were weak
imagining my sort of books did not suit her i bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused
we were in the library the master having gone to bed she consented rather unwillingly i fancied and she selected one of her own favourites and got forward steadily about an hour then came frequent questions
ellen_dean are not you tired hadnt you better lie down now you ll be sick keeping up so long ellen_dean no no dear i not tired i returned continually
perceiving me immovable she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation it changed to yawning and stretching and
that was worse she fretted and sighed and looked at her watch till eight and finally went to her room completely overdone with sleep judging by her peevish heavy look and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eye
the following night she seemed more impatient still and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache and left me
i thought her conduct odd and having remained alone a long while i resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better and asking her to come and lie on the sofa instead of up stairs in the dark
ellen_dean i tired give over then and talk i answered no catherine_earnshaw could i discover up stairs and none below the servants affirmed they had not seen her
i listened at mr_edgar door all was silence i returned to her apartment extinguished my candle and seated myself in the window
the moon shone bright a sprinkling of snow covered the ground and i reflected that she might possibly have taken it into her head to walk about the garden for refreshment
i did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park but it was not my young mistress on its emerging into the light i recognised one of the grooms
he stood a considerable period viewing the carriage road through the grounds then started off at a brisk pace as if he had detected something and reappeared presently leading miss pony and there she was just dismounted and walking by its side
the man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable miss_cathy entered by the casement window of the drawing room and glided noiselessly up to where i awaited her
she put the door gently too slipped off her snowy shoes untied her hat and was proceeding unconscious of my espionage to lay aside her mantle when i suddenly rose and revealed myself
my dear miss catherine_earnshaw i began too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold where have you been riding out at this hour
the surprise petrified her an instant she uttered an inarticulate exclamation and stood fixed and why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale
where have you been speak to the bottom of the park she stammered i didnt tell a tale and nowhere else i demanded
no was the muttered reply oh catherine_earnshaw i cried sorrowfully you know you have been doing wrong or you wouldnt be driven to uttering an untruth to me
that does grieve me i rather be three months ill than hear you frame a deliberate lie she sprang forward and bursting into tears threw her arms round my neck
well ellen_dean i so afraid of you being angry she said promise not to be angry and you shall know the very truth
we sat down in the window seat i assured her i would not scold whatever her secret might be and i guessed it of course so she commenced
i ve been to wuthering heights ellen_dean and i ve never missed going a day since you fell ill except thrice before and twice after you left your room
i hate to hide it i gave michael books and pictures to prepare minny every evening and to put her back in the stable
you mustnt scold him either mind i was at the heights by half past six and generally stayed till half past eight and then galloped home
it was not to amuse myself that i went i was often wretched all the time now and then i was happy once in a week perhaps
at first i expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to mrs_linton_heathcliff for i had engaged to call again next day when we quitted him but as you stayed up stairs on the morrow i escaped that trouble
while michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon i got possession of the key and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him because he was sick and couldnt come to the grange and how papa would object to my going
he is fond of reading and he thinks of leaving soon to get married so he offered if i would lend him books out of the library to do what i wished but i preferred giving him my own and that satisfied him better
on my second visit mrs_linton_heathcliff seemed in lively spirits and zillah that is their housekeeper made us a clean room and a good fire and told us that as joseph was out at a prayer meeting and hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw was off with his dogs robbing our woods of pheasants as i heard afterwards we might do what we liked
she brought me some warm wine and gingerbread and appeared exceedingly good natured and mrs_linton_heathcliff sat in the arm chair and i in the little rocking chair on the hearth stone and we laughed and talked so merrily and found so much to say
and then i negotiated with him about the pony we planned where we would go and what we would do in summer
he said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot july day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom and the larks singing high up overhead and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly
that was his most perfect idea of heaven happiness mine was rocking in a rustling green tree with a west wind blowing and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above and not only larks but throstles and blackbirds and linnets and cuckoos pouring out music on every side and the moors seen at a distance broken into cool dusky dells but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze and woods and sounding water and the whole world awake and wild with joy
he wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace i wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee
i said his heaven would be only half alive and he said mine would be drunk i said i should fall asleep in his and he said he could not breathe in mine and began to grow very snappish
at last we agreed to try both as soon as the right weather came and then we kissed each other and were friends
after sitting still an hour i looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor and thought how nice it would be to play in if we removed the table and i asked mrs_linton_heathcliff to call zillah in to help us and we have a game at blindman buff she should try to catch us you used to you know ellen_dean
i neednt repeat that because you would call it silly one time however we were near quarrelling he wouldnt there was no pleasure in it he said but he consented to play at ball with me
one was marked and the other i wished to have the because that stood for catherine_earnshaw and the might be for mr_heathcliff his name but the bran came out of and mrs_linton_heathcliff didnt like it
we found two in a cupboard among a heap of old toys tops and hoops and battledores and shuttlecocks i beat him constantly and he got cross again and coughed and returned to his chair
that night though he easily recovered his good humour he was charmed with two or three pretty songs your songs ellen_dean and when i was obliged to go he begged and entreated me to come the following evening and i promised
minny and i went flying home as light as air and i dreamt of wuthering heights and my sweet darling cousin till morning
on the morrow i was sad partly because you were poorly and partly that i wished my father knew and approved of my excursions but it was beautiful moonlight after tea and as i rode on the gloom cleared
i trotted up their garden and was turning round to the back when that fellow catherine_earnshaw met me took my bridle and bid me go in by the front entrance
he patted minny neck and said she was a bonny beast and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him
i shall have another happy evening i thought to myself and what delights me more my pretty mrs_linton_heathcliff will i only told him to leave my horse alone or else it would kick him
he answered in his vulgar accent it wouldnt do mitch hurt if it did and surveyed its legs with a smile
i was half inclined to make it try however he moved off to open the door and as he raised the latch he looked up to the inscription above and said with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation miss catherine_earnshaw
i can read yon now wonderful i exclaimed pray let us hear you you are grown clever he spelt and drawled over by syllables the name hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw
and the figures i cried encouragingly perceiving that he came to a dead halt i cannot tell them yet he answered
the fool stared with a grin hovering about his lips and a scowl gathering over his eye as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth whether it were not pleasant familiarity or what it really was contempt
i settled his doubts by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away for i came to see mrs_linton_heathcliff not him
oh you dunce i said laughing heartily at his failure he reddened i saw that by the moonlight dropped his hand from the latch and skulked off a picture of mortified vanity
he imagined himself to be as accomplished as mrs_linton_heathcliff i suppose because he could spell his own name and was marvellously discomfited that i didnt think the same stop miss catherine_earnshaw dear i interrupted
if you had remembered that hareton_earnshaw was your cousin as much as master mr_heathcliff you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way
at least it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as mrs_linton_heathcliff and probably he did not learn merely to show off
you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before i have no doubt and he wished to remedy it and please you
i shall not scold but i dont like your conduct there to sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding
he was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were and i hurt that he should be despised now because that base mr_heathcliff has treated him so unjustly
had you been brought up in his circumstances would you be less rude well ellen_dean you wont cry about it will you
but wait and you shall hear if he conned his a c to please me and if it were worth while being civil to the brute
she exclaimed surprised at my earnestness i entered mrs_linton_heathcliff was lying on the settle and half got up to welcome me
i ill to night catherine_earnshaw love he said and you must have all the talk and let me listen come and sit by me
i knew now that i mustnt tease him as he was ill and i spoke softly and put no questions and avoided irritating him in any way
i had brought some of my nicest books for him he asked me to read a little of one and i was about to comply when catherine_earnshaw burst the door open having gathered venom with reflection
i was sure you wouldnt break your word and i ll make you promise again before you go he advanced direct to us seized mrs_linton_heathcliff by the arm and swung him off the seat
get to thy own room he said in a voice almost inarticulate with passion and his face looked swelled and furious
he swore at us and left mrs_linton_heathcliff no time to answer nearly throwing him into the kitchen and he clenched his fist as i followed seemingly longing to knock me down
i was afraid for a moment and i let one volume fall he kicked it after me and shut us out
i heard a malignant crackly laugh by the fire and turning beheld that odious joseph standing rubbing his bony hand and quivering
take her there if she comes to see thee thou shallnt keep me out of this begone wi ye both
i wer sure he sarve ye out he a grand lad he gettent raight sperrit in him he knaws ay he knaws as weel as i do who sud bet maister yonder ech ech ech
he made ye skift properly ech ech ech where must we go i asked of my cousin disregarding the old wretch mockery
mrs_linton_heathcliff was white and trembling he was not pretty then ellen_dean oh no he looked frightful for his thin face and large eye were wrought into an expression of frantic powerless fury
he grasped the handle of the door and shook it it was fastened inside if you dont let me in i ll kill you if you dont let me in i ll kill you
he rather shrieked than said devil devil i ll kill you i ll kill you joseph uttered his croaking laugh again
thear that st father he cried that father we ve allas summut either side in us niver heed hareton_earnshaw lad dunnut be feard he cannot get at thee
i took hold of mrs_linton_heathcliff hand and tried to pull him away but he shrieked so shockingly that i dared not proceed
at last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing blood gushed from his mouth and he fell on the ground
she soon heard me she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn and hurrying from her work she inquired what there was to do
i ran into the yard sick with terror and called for zillah as loud as i could i hadnt breath to explain dragging her in
i looked about for mrs_linton_heathcliff catherine_earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused and he was then conveying the poor thing up stairs
zillah and i ascended after him but he stopped me at the top of the steps and said i shouldnt go in i must go home
joseph locked the door and declared i should do no sich stuff and asked me whether i were bahn to be as mad as him
she affirmed he would be better in a bit but he couldnt do with that shrieking and din and she took me and nearly carried me into the house
i exclaimed that he had killed mrs_linton_heathcliff and i would enter i stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared ellen_dean i was ready to tear my hair off my head
i sobbed and wept so that my eye were almost blind and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite presuming every now and then to bid me wisht and denying that it was his fault and finally frightened by my assertions that i would tell papa and that he should be put in prison and hanged he commenced blubbering himself and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation
still i was not rid of him when at length they compelled me to depart and i had got some hundred yards off the premises he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road side and checked minny and took hold of me
miss catherine_earnshaw i ill grieved he began but it rayther too bad i gave him a cut with my whip thinking perhaps he would murder me
he let go thundering one of his horrid curses and i galloped home more than half out of my senses
i wished to go exceedingly but i was strangely excited and dreaded to hear that mrs_linton_heathcliff was dead sometimes and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering hareton_earnshaw
i didnt bid you good night that evening and i didnt go to wuthering heights the next on the third day i took courage at least i couldnt bear longer suspense and stole off once more
i went at five clock and walked fancying i might manage to creep into the house and up to mrs_linton_heathcliff room unobserved
zillah received me and saying the lad was mending nicely showed me into a small tidy carpeted apartment where to my inexpressible joy i beheld mrs_linton_heathcliff laid on a little sofa reading one of my books
but he would neither speak to me nor look at me through a whole hour ellen_dean he has such an unhappy temper
and what quite confounded me when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood that i had occasioned the uproar and hareton_earnshaw was not to blame
however the dogs gave notice of my approach unable to reply except passionately i got up and walked from the room
he did not reckon on being answered so but i wouldnt turn back and the morrow was the second day on which i stayed at home nearly determined to visit him no more
but it was so miserable going to bed and getting up and never hearing anything about him that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed
he sent after me a faint catherine_earnshaw it had appeared wrong to take the journey once now it seemed wrong to refrain
michael came to ask if he must saddle minny i said yes and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills
i was forced to pass the front window to get to the court it was no use trying to conceal my presence
young master is in the house said zillah as she saw me making for the parlour i went in catherine_earnshaw was there also but he quitted the room directly
mrs_linton_heathcliff sat in the great arm chair half asleep walking up to the fire i began in a serious tone partly meaning it to be true
as you dont like me mrs_linton_heathcliff and as you think i come on purpose to hurt you and pretend that i do so every time this is our last meeting let us say good bye and tell mr_heathcliff that you have no wish to see me and that he mustnt invent any more falsehoods on the subject
sit down and take your hat off catherine_earnshaw he answered you are so much happier than i am you ought to be better
i doubt whether i am not altogether as worthless as he calls me frequently and then i feel so cross and bitter
papa talks enough of my defects and shows enough scorn of me to make it natural i should doubt myself i hate everybody
i am worthless and bad in temper and bad in spirit almost always and if you choose you may say good bye you ll get rid of an annoyance
only catherine_earnshaw do me this justice believe that if i might be as sweet and as kind and as good as you are i would be as willingly and more so than as happy and as healthy
and believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love and though i couldnt and cannot help showing my nature to you i regret it and repent it and shall regret and repent it till i die
i felt he spoke the truth and i felt i must forgive him and though we should quarrel the next moment i must forgive him again
we were reconciled but we cried both of us the whole time i stayed not entirely for sorrow yet i was sorry mrs_linton_heathcliff had that distorted nature
he ll never let his friends be at ease and he ll never be at ease himself i have always gone to his little parlour since that night because his father returned the day after
about three time i think we have been merry and hopeful as we were the first evening the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled now with his selfishness and spite and now with his sufferings but i ve learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter
last sunday indeed coming earlier than usual i heard him abusing poor mrs_linton_heathcliff cruelly for his conduct of the night before
mr_heathcliff purposely avoids me i have hardly seen him at all i cant tell how he knew of it unless he listened
mrs_linton_heathcliff had certainly behaved provokingly however it was the business of nobody but me and i interrupted mr_heathcliff lecture by entering and telling him so
he burst into a laugh and went away saying he was glad i took that view of the matter since then i ve told mrs_linton_heathcliff he must whisper his bitter things
i cant be prevented from going to wuthering heights except by inflicting misery on two people whereas if you ll only not tell papa my going need disturb the tranquillity of none
now ellen_dean you have heard all you ll not tell will you it will be very heartless if you do i ll make up my mind on that point by to morrow miss catherine_earnshaw i replied
i thought it over aloud in my master presence walking straight from her room to his and relating the whole story with the exception of her conversations with her cousin and any mention of hareton_earnshaw
it requires some study and so i ll leave you to your rest and go think it over mr mrs_linton_heathcliff was alarmed and distressed more than he would acknowledge to me
in the morning catherine_earnshaw learnt my betrayal of her confidence and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end
in vain she wept and writhed against the interdict and implored her father to have pity on mrs_linton_heathcliff all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the grange when he pleased but explaining that he must no longer expect to see catherine_earnshaw at wuthering heights
perhaps had he been aware of his nephew disposition and state of health he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation
last winter i did not think at another twelve months end i should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them
chapter xxv these things happened last winter sir said mrs ellen_dean hardly more than a year ago yet who knows how long you ll be a stranger
you re too young to rest always contented living by yourself and i some way fancy no one could see catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff and not love her
you smile but why do you look so lively and interested when i talk about her and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace
and why stop my good friend i cried it may be very possible that i should love her but would she love me
i doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running into temptation and then my home is not here i of the busy world and to its arms i must return
her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart and he spoke without anger he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes where his remembered word would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her
go on was catherine_earnshaw obedient to her father commands she was continued the housekeeper he said to me a few days afterwards i wish my nephew would write ellen_dean or call
tell me sincerely what you think of him is he changed for the better or is there a prospect of improvement as he grows a man
he very delicate sir i replied and scarcely likely to reach manhood but this i can say he does not resemble his father and if miss catherine_earnshaw had the misfortune to marry him he would not be beyond her control unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent
however master you ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see whether he would suit her it wants four year and more to his being of age
it was a misty afternoon but the february sun shone dimly and we could just distinguish the two fir trees in the yard and the sparely scattered gravestones
i ve prayed often he half soliloquised for the approach of what is coming and now i begin to shrink and fear it
i thought the memory of the hour i came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticipation that i was soon in a few months or possibly weeks to be carried up and laid in its lonely hollow
ellen_dean i ve been very happy with my little miss_cathy through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side
but i ve been as happy musing by myself among those stones under that old church lying through the long june evenings on the green mound of her mother grave and wishing yearning for the time when i might lie beneath it
mr_edgar sighed and walking to the window looked out towards gimmerton_kirk what can i do for miss_cathy how must i quit her
i not care one moment for mrs_linton_heathcliff being mr_heathcliff son nor for his taking her from me if he could console her for my loss
i not care that mr_heathcliff gained his ends and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing but should mrs_linton_heathcliff be unworthy only a feeble tool to his father i cannot abandon her to him
and hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit i must persevere in making her sad while i live and leaving her solitary when i die
darling i rather resign her to god and lay her in the earth before me resign her to god as it is sir i answered and
miss catherine_earnshaw is a good girl i dont fear that she will go wilfully wrong and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded
if we should lose you which may he forbid under his providence i ll stand her friend and counsellor to the last spring advanced yet my master gathered no real strength though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter
to her inexperienced notions this itself was a sign of convalescence and then his cheek was often flushed and his eye were bright she felt sure of his recovering
on her seventeenth birthday he did not visit the churchyard it was raining and i observed you ll surely not go out to night sir
he wrote again to mrs_linton_heathcliff expressing his great desire to see him and had the invalid been presentable i ve no doubt his father would have permitted him to come
as it was being instructed he returned an answer intimating that mr_heathcliff objected to his calling at the grange but his uncle kind remembrance delighted him and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided
he answered no i ll defer it this year a little longer that part of his letter was simple and probably his own
i do not ask he said that she may visit here but am i never to see her because my father forbids me to go to her home and you forbid her to come to mine
mr_heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently for catherine_earnshaw company then do now and then ride with her towards the heights and let us exchange a few word in your presence
we have done nothing to deserve this separation and you are not angry with me you have no reason to dislike me you allow yourself
i believe an interview would convince you that my father character is not mine he affirms i am more your nephew than his son and though i have faults which render me unworthy of catherine_earnshaw she has excused them and for her sake you should also
you inquire after my health it is better but while i remain cut off from all hope and doomed to solitude or the society of those who never did and never will like me how can i be cheerful and well
dear uncle send me a kind note to morrow and leave to join you anywhere you please except at thrushcross_grange mr_edgar though he felt for the boy could not consent to grant his request because he could not accompany catherine_earnshaw
he said in summer perhaps they might meet meantime he wished him to continue writing at intervals and engaged to give him what advice and comfort
mrs_linton_heathcliff complied and had he been unrestrained would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations but his father kept a sharp watch over him and of course insisted on every line that my master sent being shown so instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love and gently intimated that mr mrs_linton_heathcliff must allow an interview soon or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises
miss_cathy was a powerful ally at home and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week under my guardianship and on the moors nearest the grange for june found him still declining
though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady fortune he had a natural desire that she might retain or at least return in a short time to the house of her ancestors and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself nor had any one
i believe no doctor visited the heights and no one saw master mr_heathcliff to make report of his condition among us
i for my part began to fancy my forebodings were false and that he must be actually rallying when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object
i could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as i afterwards learned mr_heathcliff had treated him to compel this apparent eagerness his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death
chapter xxvi summer was already past its prime when mr_edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties and catherine_earnshaw and i set out on our first ride to join her cousin
it was a close sultry day devoid of sunshine but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide stone by the cross roads
on arriving there however a little herd boy despatched as a messenger told us that maister mrs_linton_heathcliff wer just this side th heights and he be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further
then master mrs_linton_heathcliff has forgot the first injunction of his uncle i observed he bid us keep on the grange land and here we are off at once
he was able by letter being well aware of his hard position in his family well we ll turn our horses head round when we reach him answered my companion our excursion shall lie towards home
but when we reached him and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door we found he had no horse and we were forced to dismount and leave ours to graze
then he walked so feebly and looked so pale that i immediately exclaimed why master mr_heathcliff you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning
he lay on the heath awaiting our approach and did not rise till we came within a few yards how ill you do look
catherine_earnshaw surveyed him with grief and astonishment she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm and the congratulation on their long postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry whether he were worse than usual
he panted trembling and retaining her hand as if he needed its support while his large blue eye wandered timidly over her the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed
no better better but you have been worse persisted his cousin worse than when i saw you last you are thinner and
i tired he interrupted hurriedly it is too hot for walking let us rest here and in the morning i often feel sick papa says i grow so fast
badly satisfied miss_cathy sat down and he reclined beside her this is something like your paradise said she making an effort at cheerfulness
you recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest this is nearly yours only there are clouds but then they are so soft and mellow
it is nicer than sunshine next week if you can we ll ride down to the grange park and try mine
mrs_linton_heathcliff did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation
his lack of interest in the subjects she started and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment
the pettishness that might be caressed into fondness had yielded to a listless apathy there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed and more of the self absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid repelling consolation and ready to regard the good humoured mirth of others as an insult
catherine_earnshaw perceived as well as i did that he held it rather a punishment than a gratification to endure our company and she made no scruple of proposing presently to depart
an indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner that proposal unexpectedly roused mrs_linton_heathcliff from his lethargy and threw him into a strange state of agitation
but i think said miss_cathy you be more comfortable at home than sitting here and i cannot amuse you to day i see by my tales and songs and chatter you have grown wiser than i in these six months you have little taste for my diversions now or else if i could amuse you i willingly stay
he glanced fearfully towards the heights begging she would remain another half hour at least stay to rest yourself he replied
it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull and i walked about before you came a great deal for me
and catherine_earnshaw dont think or say that i very unwell tell uncle i in tolerable health will you i ll tell him that you say so mrs_linton_heathcliff
i couldnt affirm that you are observed my young lady wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth
and be here again next thursday continued he shunning her puzzled gaze and give him my thanks for permitting you to come my best thanks catherine_earnshaw
and and if you did meet my father and he asked you about me dont lead him to suppose that i ve been extremely silent and stupid
dont look sad and downcast as you are doing he ll be angry i care nothing for his anger exclaimed miss_cathy imagining she would be its object
but i do said her cousin shuddering dont provoke him against me catherine_earnshaw for he is very hard is he severe to you master mr_heathcliff
mrs_linton_heathcliff looked at me but did not answer and after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes during which his head fell drowsily on his breast and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain miss_cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries and sharing the produce of her researches with me she did not offer them to him for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy
i inquired has he grown weary of indulgence and passed from passive to active hatred is it half an hour now ellen_dean
she whispered in my ear at last i cant tell why we should stay he asleep and papa will be wanting us back
well we must not leave him asleep i answered wait till he wakes and be patient you were mighty eager to set off but your longing to see poor mrs_linton_heathcliff has soon evaporated
why did he wish to see me returned catherine_earnshaw in his crossest humours formerly i liked him better than i do in his present curious mood
but i hardly going to come to give mr_heathcliff pleasure whatever reason he may have for ordering mrs_linton_heathcliff to undergo this penance
and though i glad he better in health i sorry he so much less pleasant and so much less affectionate to me
it just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform this interview for fear his father should scold him
you think he is better in health then i said yes she answered because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings you know
he is not tolerably well as he told me to tell papa but he better very likely there you differ with me miss_cathy i remarked i should conjecture him to be far worse
mrs_linton_heathcliff here started from his slumber in bewildered terror and asked if any one had called his name no said catherine_earnshaw unless in dreams
i cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of door in the morning i thought i heard my father he gasped glancing up to the frowning nab above us
you are sure nobody spoke quite sure replied his cousin only ellen_dean and i were disputing concerning your health
are you truly stronger mrs_linton_heathcliff than when we separated in winter if you be i certain one thing is not stronger your regard for me speak are you
the tears gushed from mrs_linton_heathcliff eye as he answered yes yes i am and still under the spell of the imaginary voice his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner
miss_cathy rose for to day we must part she said and i wont conceal that i have been sadly disappointed with our meeting though i ll mention it to nobody
but you not that i stand in awe of mr_heathcliff hush murmured mrs_linton_heathcliff for god sake hush he coming
and he clung to catherine_earnshaw arm striving to detain her but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself and whistled to minny who obeyed her like a dog
i ll be here next thursday she cried springing to the saddle good bye quick ellen_dean and so we left him scarcely conscious of our departure
before we reached home catherine_earnshaw displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret largely blended with vague uneasy doubts about mrs_linton_heathcliff actual circumstances physical and social in which i partook though i counselled her not to say much for a second journey would make us better judges
his nephew offering of thanks was duly delivered miss_cathy gently touching on the rest i also threw little light on his inquiries for i hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal
so absorbed was he in anticipating his father approach my master requested an account of our ongoings chapter xxvii seven days glided away every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff state
catherine_earnshaw we would fain have deluded yet but her own quick spirit refused to delude her it divined in secret and brooded on the dreadful probability gradually ripening into certainty
she had not the heart to mention her ride when thursday came round i mentioned it for her and obtained permission to order her out of door for the library where her father stopped a short time daily the brief period he could bear to sit up and his chamber had become her whole world
the havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours she grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow or seated by his side
her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death
he had a fixed idea i guessed by several observations he let fall that as his nephew resembled him in person he would resemble him in mind for mrs_linton_heathcliff letters bore few or no indications of his defective character
and i through pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account
we deferred our excursion till the afternoon a golden afternoon of august every breath from the hills so full of life that it seemed whoever respired it though dying might revive
catherine_earnshaw face was just like the landscape shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession but the shadows rested longer and the sunshine was more transient and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares
my young mistress alighted and told me that as she was resolved to stay a very little while i had better hold the pony and remain on horseback but i dissented i wouldnt risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute so we climbed the slope of heath together
master mr_heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion not the animation of high spirits though nor yet of joy it looked more like fear
we discerned mrs_linton_heathcliff watching at the same spot he had selected before it is late he said speaking short and with difficulty
is not your father very ill i thought you wouldnt come why wont you be candid cried catherine_earnshaw swallowing her greeting
it is strange mrs_linton_heathcliff that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose apparently to distress us both and for no reason besides
mrs_linton_heathcliff shivered and glanced at her half supplicating half ashamed but his cousin patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour
why cannot you say at once you dont want me my father is very ill she said and why am i called from his bedside
i desire an explanation playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind and i cant dance attendance on your affectations now my affectations
why didnt you send to absolve me from my promise when you wished i wouldnt keep it come he murmured what are they
for heaven sake catherine_earnshaw dont look so angry despise me as much as you please i am a worthless cowardly wretch i cant be scorned enough but i too mean for your anger
hate my father and spare me for contempt nonsense cried catherine_earnshaw in a passion foolish silly boy and there he trembles as if i were really going to touch him
you neednt bespeak contempt mrs_linton_heathcliff anybody will have it spontaneously at your service get off i shall return home it is folly dragging you from the hearth stone and pretending what do we pretend
let go my frock if i pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened you should spurn such pity ellen_dean tell him how disgraceful this conduct is
with streaming face and an expression of agony mrs_linton_heathcliff had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror
rise and dont degrade yourself into an abject reptile dont oh he sobbed i cannot bear it catherine_earnshaw catherine i a traitor too and i dare not tell you
dear catherine_earnshaw my life is in your hand and you have said you loved me and if you did it wouldnt harm you
but leave me and i shall be killed you ll not go then kind sweet good catherine_earnshaw and perhaps you will consent and he ll let me die with you
my young lady on witnessing his intense anguish stooped to raise him the old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed
consent to what she asked to stay tell me the meaning of this strange talk and i will you contradict your own word and distract me
be calm and frank and confess at once all that weighs on your heart you wouldnt injure me mrs_linton_heathcliff would you
you wouldnt let any enemy hurt me if you could prevent it i ll believe you are a coward for yourself but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend
but my father threatened me gasped the boy clasping his attenuated fingers and i dread him i dread him i dare not tell
her magnanimity provoked his tears he wept wildly kissing her supporting hand and yet could not summon courage to speak out
i was cogitating what the mystery might be and determined catherine_earnshaw should never suffer to benefit him or any one else by my good will when hearing a rustle among the ling i looked up and saw mr_heathcliff almost close upon us descending the heights
he didnt cast a glance towards my companions though they were sufficiently near for mrs_linton_heathcliff sobs to be audible but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides and the sincerity of which i couldnt avoid doubting he said it is something to see you so near to my house nelly_dean
oh well said catherine_earnshaw with scornful compassion keep your secret i no coward save yourself i not afraid how are you at the grange
the rumour goes he added in a lower tone that mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff is on his death bed perhaps they exaggerate his illness
let us hear no my master is dying i replied it is true enough a sad thing it will be for us all but a blessing for him
because he continued looking at the two young people who were fixed under his eye mrs_linton_heathcliff appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head and catherine_earnshaw could not move on his account because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me and i thank his uncle to be quick and go before him
how long will he last do you think he asked i dont know i said hallo has the whelp been playing that game long
i did give him some lessons about snivelling is he pretty lively with miss mrs_linton_heathcliff generally lively no he has shown the greatest distress i answered
to see him i should say that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills he ought to be in bed under the hand of a doctor
he shall be in a day or two muttered mr_heathcliff but first get up mrs_linton_heathcliff get up he shouted dont grovel on the ground there up this moment
mrs_linton_heathcliff had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear caused by his father glance towards him i suppose there was nothing else to produce such humiliation
he made several efforts to obey but his little strength was annihilated for the time and he fell back again with a moan
mr_heathcliff advanced and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf now said he with curbed ferocity i getting angry and if you dont command that paltry spirit of yours
damn you get up directly i will father he panted only let me alone or i shall faint i ve done as you wished i sure
catherine_earnshaw will tell you that i that i have been cheerful ah keep by me catherine_earnshaw give me your hand take mine said his father stand on your feet
there now she ll lend you her arm that right look at her you would imagine i was the devil himself miss mrs_linton_heathcliff to excite such horror
be so kind as to walk home with him will you he shudders if i touch him mrs_linton_heathcliff dear whispered catherine_earnshaw i cant go to wuthering heights papa has forbidden me
he ll not harm you why are you so afraid i can never re enter that house he answered i not to re enter it without you stop cried his father
we ll respect catherine_earnshaw filial scruples nelly_dean take him in and i ll follow your advice concerning the doctor without delay you ll do well replied i
you are very stiff said mr_heathcliff i know that but you ll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity
but i must remain with my mistress to mind your son is not my business come then my hero are you willing to return escorted by me
he approached once more and made as if he would seize the fragile being but shrinking back mrs_linton_heathcliff clung to his cousin and implored her to accompany him with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial
what was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning but there he was powerless under its grip and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy
we reached the threshold catherine_earnshaw walked in and i stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair expecting her out immediately when mr_heathcliff pushing me forward exclaimed my house is not stricken with the plague nelly_dean and i have a mind to be hospitable to day sit down and allow me to shut the door
however i disapproved i couldnt hinder her indeed how could she have refused him herself he shut and locked it also
hareton_earnshaw is gone with some cattle to the lees and zillah and joseph are off on a journey of pleasure and though i used to being alone
i started you shall have tea before you go home he added i am by myself i rather have some interesting company if i can get it
miss mrs_linton_heathcliff take your seat by him i give you what i have the present is hardly worth accepting but i have nothing else to offer
it is mrs_linton_heathcliff i mean how she does stare it odd what a savage feeling i have to anything that seems afraid of me
had i been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty i should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two as an evening amusement
he drew in his breath struck the table and swore to himself by hell i hate them i am not afraid of you
exclaimed catherine_earnshaw who could not hear the latter part of his speech she stepped close up her black eye flashing with passion and resolution
give me that key i will have it she said i wouldnt eat or drink here if i were starving
he looked up seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness or possibly reminded by her voice and glance of the person from whom she inherited it
she snatched at the instrument and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers but her action recalled him to the present he recovered it speedily
mr_heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table now catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff he said stand off or i shall knock you down and that will make mrs ellen_dean mad
she repeated exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax and finding that her nails made no impression she applied her teeth pretty sharply
regardless of this warning she captured his closed hand and its contents again we will go mr_heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment
he opened them suddenly and resigned the object of dispute but ere she had well secured it he seized her with the liberated hand and pulling her on his knee administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat had she been able to fall
catherine_earnshaw was too intent on his fingers to notice his face at this diabolical violence i rushed on him furiously
a touch on the chest silenced me i am stout and soon put out of breath and what with that and the rage i staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate or to burst a blood vessel
the scene was over in two minutes catherine_earnshaw released put her two hand to her temples and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on
you villain i began to cry you villain she trembled like a reed poor thing and leant against the table perfectly bewildered
i know how to chastise child you see said the scoundrel grimly as he stooped to repossess himself of the key which had dropped to the floor
go to mrs_linton_heathcliff now as i told you and cry at your ease i shall be your father to morrow all the father you ll have in a few days and you shall have plenty of that
you can bear plenty you re no weakling you shall have a daily taste if i catch such a devil of a temper in your eye again
miss_cathy ran to me instead of mrs_linton_heathcliff and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap weeping aloud her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle as quiet as a mouse congratulating himself
i dare say that the correction had alighted on another than him mr_heathcliff perceiving us all confounded rose and expeditiously made the tea himself
the cups and saucers were laid ready he poured it out and handed me a cup wash away your spleen he said
and help your own naughty pet and mine it is not poisoned though i prepared it i going out to seek your horses
we tried the kitchen door but that was fastened outside we looked at the window they were too narrow for even miss_cathy little figure
master mrs_linton_heathcliff i cried seeing we were regularly imprisoned you know what your diabolical father is after and you shall tell us or i ll box your ears as he has done your cousin
it was for your sake i came and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse give me some tea i thirsty and then i ll tell you he answered
our first thought on his departure was to force an exit somewhere yes mrs_linton_heathcliff you must tell said catherine_earnshaw mrs ellen_dean go away
i dont like you standing over me now catherine_earnshaw you are letting your tears fall into my cup i wont drink that
give me another catherine_earnshaw pushed another to him and wiped her face i felt disgusted at the little wretch composure since he was no longer in terror for himself
the anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered wuthering heights so i guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there and that accomplished he had no further immediate fears
and he knows your papa wouldnt let us marry now and he afraid of my dying if we wait so we are to be married in the morning and you are to stay here all night and if you do as he wishes you shall return home next day and take me with you
papa wants us to be married he continued after sipping some of the liquid take you with her pitiful changeling
and do you imagine that beautiful young lady that healthy hearty girl will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you
i exclaimed you marry why the man is mad or he thinks us fools every one are you cherishing the notion that anybody let alone miss catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff would have you for a husband
you want whipping for bringing us in here at all with your dastardly puling tricks and dont look so silly now i ve a very good mind to shake you severely for your contemptible treachery and your imbecile conceit
i did give him a slight shaking but it brought on the cough and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping and catherine_earnshaw rebuked me
and she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly but mrs_linton_heathcliff was up in alarm for his dear self again
stay all night no she said looking slowly round ellen_dean i ll burn that door down but i ll get out he clasped her in his two feeble arms
sobbing wont you have me and save me not let me come to the grange oh darling catherine_earnshaw you mustnt go and leave after all
you must obey my father you must i must obey my own she replied and relieve him from this cruel suspense
the whole night what would he think he ll be distressed already i ll either break or burn a way out of the house
be quiet you re in no danger but if you hinder me mrs_linton_heathcliff i love papa better than you the mortal terror he felt of mr_heathcliff anger restored to the boy his coward eloquence
catherine_earnshaw was near distraught still she persisted that she must go home and tried entreaty in her turn persuading him to subdue his selfish agony
while they were thus occupied our jailor re entered your beasts have trotted off he said and now mrs_linton_heathcliff snivelling again what has she been doing to you
in a month or two my lad you ll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand
come come have done and get to bed you re pining for pure love are you not nothing else in the world and
she shall have you there to bed zillah wont be here to night you must undress yourself hush hold your noise once in your own room i ll not come near you you neednt fear
he spoke these word holding the door open for his son to pass and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze
by chance you ve managed tolerably i ll look to the rest the lock was re secured mr_heathcliff approached the fire where my mistress and i stood silent
catherine_earnshaw looked up and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness but he scowled on her
i am afraid now she replied because if i stay papa will be miserable and how can i endure making him miserable when he when he mr
and muttered oh you are not afraid of me your courage is well disguised you seem damnably afraid mr_heathcliff let me go home
why should you wish to force me to do what i ll willingly do of myself let him dare to force you i cried
i promise to marry mrs_linton_heathcliff papa would like me to and i love him there law in the land thank god
there is though we be in an out of the way place i inform if he were my own son and it felony without benefit of clergy
silence said the ruffian to the devil with your clamour i dont want you to speak miss mrs_linton_heathcliff i shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable i shall not sleep for satisfaction
you could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twenty four hours than informing me that such an event would follow
as to your promise to marry mrs_linton_heathcliff i ll take care you shall keep it for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled
send ellen_dean then to let papa know i safe exclaimed catherine_earnshaw weeping bitterly or marry me now poor papa ellen_dean he ll think we re lost
what shall we do not he he ll think you are tired of waiting on him and run off for a little amusement answered mr_heathcliff
and it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age and that you would weary of nursing a sick man and that man only your father
you cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary catherine_earnshaw his happiest days were over when your days began
he cursed you i dare say for coming into the world i did at least and it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it
as far as i can see it will be your chief diversion hereafter unless mrs_linton_heathcliff make amends for other losses and your provident parent appears to fancy he may
i join him i dont love you how should i weep away his letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly
in his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his and kind to her when he got her careful and kind
that paternal but mrs_linton_heathcliff requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself mrs_linton_heathcliff can play the little tyrant well
he ll undertake to torture any number of cats if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared you ll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness
show his resemblance to yourself and then i hope miss_cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice i dont much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now he answered because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner and you along with her till your master dies
when you get home again i assure you you re right there i said explain your son character i can detain you both quite concealed here
if you doubt encourage her to retract her word and you ll have an opportunity of judging i ll not retract my word said catherine_earnshaw
mr_heathcliff you re a cruel man but you re not a fiend and you wont from mere malice destroy irrevocably all my happiness
if papa thought i had left him on purpose and if he died before i returned could i bear to live
i ve given over crying but i going to kneel here at your knee and i ll not get up and i ll not take my eye from your face till you look back at me
i ll marry him within this hour if i may go to thrushcross_grange afterwards no dont turn away do look
you ll see nothing to provoke you i dont hate you i not angry that you struck me have you never loved anybody in all your life uncle
never ah you must look once i so wretched you cant help being sorry and pitying me keep your eft fingers off and move or i ll kick you
cried mr_heathcliff brutally repulsing her i rather be hugged by a snake how the devil can you dream of fawning on me
he shrugged his shoulders shook himself indeed as if his flesh crept with aversion and thrust back his chair while i got up and opened my mouth to commence a downright torrent of abuse
but i was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence by a threat that i should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable i uttered
i detest you it was growing dark we heard a sound of voices at the garden gate our host hurried out instantly he had his wits about him we had not
there was a talk of two or three minutes and he returned alone i thought it had been your cousin hareton_earnshaw i observed to catherine_earnshaw
i wish he would arrive who knows but he might take our part it was three servants sent to seek you from the grange said mr_heathcliff overhearing me
you should have opened a lattice and called out but i could swear that chit is glad you didnt she glad to be obliged to stay i certain
at learning the chance we had missed we both gave vent to our grief without control and he allowed us to wail on till nine clock
then he bid us go upstairs through the kitchen to zillah chamber and i whispered my companion to obey perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there or into a garret and out by its skylight
the window however was narrow like those below and the garret trap was safe from our attempts for we were fastened in as before
we neither of us lay down catherine_earnshaw took her station by the lattice and watched anxiously for morning a deep sigh being the only answer i could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest
i seated myself in a chair and rocked to and fro passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty from which it struck me then all the misfortunes of my employers sprang
it was not the case in reality i am aware but it was in my imagination that dismal night and i thought mr_heathcliff himself less guilty than i
at seven clock he came and inquired if miss mrs_linton_heathcliff had risen she ran to the door immediately and answered yes
here then he said opening it and pulling her out i rose to follow but he turned the lock again i demanded my release
be patient he replied i ll send up your breakfast in a while i thumped on the panels and rattled the latch angrily and catherine_earnshaw asked why i was still shut up
he answered i must try to endure it another hour and they went away i endured it two or three hours at length i heard a footstep not mr_heathcliff
i ve brought you something to eat said a voice oppent door complying eagerly i beheld hareton_earnshaw laden with food enough to last me all day
tak it he added thrusting the tray into my hand stay one minute i began nay cried he and retired regardless of any prayers i could pour forth to detain him
and there i remained enclosed the whole day and the whole of the next night and another and another five nights and four days
i remained altogether seeing nobody but hareton_earnshaw once every morning and he was a model of a jailor surly and dumb and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion
on the fifth morning or rather afternoon a different step approached lighter and shorter and this time the person entered the room
it was zillah donned in her scarlet shawl with a black silk bonnet on her head and a willow basket swung to her arm
i never thought but you were sunk in the blackhorse marsh and missy with you till master told me you been found and he lodged you here
chapter xxviii eh dear mrs ellen_dean she exclaimed well there is a talk about you at gimmerton_kirk what and you must have got on an island sure
and how long were you in the hole did master save you mrs ellen_dean but you re not so thin you ve not been so poorly have you
your master is a true scoundrel i replied but he shall answer for it he neednt have raised that tale it shall all be laid bare
it not his tale they tell that in the village about your being lost in the marsh and i calls to catherine_earnshaw when i come in eh they queer things mr hareton_earnshaw happened since i went off
what do you mean asked zillah it a sad pity of that likely young lass and cant nelly_dean ellen_dean
the master listened and he just smiled to himself and said if they have been in the marsh they are out now zillah
he stared i thought he had not heard aught so i told him the rumour nelly_dean ellen_dean is lodged at this minute in your room
the bog water got into her head and she would have run home quite flighty but i fixed her till she came round to her senses
you can bid her go to the grange at once if she be able and carry a message from me that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire funeral
you can tell her to flit when you go up here is the key mr_edgar is not dead i gasped
oh zillah zillah no no sit you down my good mistress she replied you re right sickly yet he not dead doctor mr_kenneth thinks he may last another day
i met him on the road and asked instead of sitting down i snatched my outdoor things and hastened below for the way was free
on entering the house i looked about for some one to give information of catherine_earnshaw the place was filled with sunshine and the door stood wide open but nobody seemed at hand
as i hesitated whether to go off at once or return and seek my mistress a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth
mrs_linton_heathcliff lay on the settle sole tenant sucking a stick of sugar candy and pursuing my movements with apathetic eye where is miss catherine_earnshaw
i demanded sternly supposing i could frighten him into giving intelligence by catching him thus alone he sucked on like an innocent
is she gone i said no he replied she upstairs she not to go we wont let her you wont let her little idiot
i exclaimed direct me to her room immediately or i ll make you sing out sharply papa would make you sing out if you attempted to get there he answered
he says i not to be soft with catherine_earnshaw she my wife and it shameful that she should wish to leave me
he says she hates me and wants me to die that she may have my money but she shant have it and she shant go home
she never shall she may cry and be sick as much as she pleases he resumed his former occupation closing his lids as if he meant to drop asleep
master mr_heathcliff i resumed have you forgotten all catherine_earnshaw kindness to you last winter when you affirmed you loved her and when she brought you books and sung you songs and came many a time through wind and snow to see you
she wept to miss one evening because you would be disappointed and you felt then that she was a hundred time too good to you and now you believe the lies your father tells though you know he detests you both
and you join him against her that fine gratitude is it not the corner of mrs_linton_heathcliff mouth fell and he took the sugar candy from his lips
did she come to wuthering heights because she hated you i continued think for yourself as to your money she does not even know that you will have any
and you say she sick and yet you leave her alone up there in a strange house you who have felt what it is to be so neglected
i shed tears master mr_heathcliff you see an elderly woman and a servant merely and you after pretending such affection and having reason to worship her almost store every tear you have for yourself and lie there quite at ease
you could pity your own sufferings and she pitied them too but you wont pity hers ah you re a heartless selfish boy
i cant stay with her he answered crossly i ll not stay by myself she cries so i cant bear it
i did call him once and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet but she began again the instant he left the room moaning and grieving all night long though i screamed for vexation that i couldnt sleep is mr_heathcliff out
and she wont give over though i say i ll call my father i inquired perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathize with his cousin mental tortures
he in the court he replied talking to doctor mr_kenneth who says uncle is dying truly at last i glad for i shall be master of the grange after him
all her nice books are mine she offered to give me them and her pretty birds and her pony minny if i would get the key of our room and let her out but i told her she had nothing to give they were all all mine
and then she cried and took a little picture from her neck and said i should have that two pictures in a gold case on one side her mother and on the other uncle when they were young
catherine_earnshaw always spoke of it as her house it isnt hers it mine papa says everything she has is mine that was yesterday i said they were mine too and tried to get them from her
she heard papa coming and she broke the hinges and divided the case and gave me her mother portrait the other she attempted to hide but papa asked what was the matter and i explained it
he took the one i had away and ordered her to resign hers to me she refused and he he struck her down and wrenched it off the chain and crushed it with his foot
the spiteful thing wouldnt let me she pushed me off and hurt me i shrieked out that frightens her and were you pleased to see her struck
i winked he answered i wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse he does it so hard
yet i was glad at first she deserved punishing for pushing me but when papa was gone she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside against her teeth and her mouth filling with blood and then she gathered up the bits of the picture and went and sat down with her face to the wall and she has never spoken to me since
i dont like to think so but she a naughty thing for crying continually and she looks so pale and wild
i asked having my designs in encouraging his talk and i sometimes think she cant speak for pain i afraid of her
and you can get the key if you choose i said yes when i am up stairs he answered but i cant walk up stairs now
in what apartment is it i asked oh he cried i shant tell you where it is it is our secret
nobody neither hareton_earnshaw nor zillah is to know there you ve tired me go away go away and he turned his face on to his arm and shut his eye again
i considered it best to depart without seeing mr_heathcliff and bring a rescue for my young lady from the grange
on reaching it the astonishment of my fellow servants to see me and their joy also was intense and when they heard that their little mistress was safe two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at mr_edgar door but i bespoke the announcement of it myself
how changed i found him even in those few days he lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting his death
very young he looked though his actual age was thirty nine one would have called him ten year younger at least he thought of catherine_earnshaw for he murmured her name
i touched his hand and spoke catherine_earnshaw is coming dear master i whispered she is alive and well and will be here i hope to night
i trembled at the first effects of this intelligence he half rose up looked eagerly round the apartment and then sank back in a swoon
as soon as he recovered i related our compulsory visit and detention at the heights i said mr_heathcliff forced me to go in which was not quite true
i uttered as little as possible against mrs_linton_heathcliff nor did i describe all his father brutal conduct my intentions being to add no bitterness if i could help it to his already over flowing cup
he divined that one of his enemy purposes was to secure the personal property as well as the estate to his son or rather himself yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together
however he felt that his will had better be altered instead of leaving catherine_earnshaw fortune at her own disposal he determined to put it in the hand of trustees for her use during life and for her child if she had any after her
having received his orders i despatched a man to fetch the attorney and four more provided with serviceable weapons to demand my young lady of her jailor
by that means it could not fall to mr_heathcliff should mrs_linton_heathcliff die both parties were delayed very late the single servant returned first
he said mr green the lawyer was out when he arrived at his house and he had to wait two hours for his re entrance and then mr green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done but he would be at thrushcross_grange before morning
they brought word that catherine_earnshaw was ill too ill to quit her room and mr_heathcliff would not suffer them to see her
i scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale which i would not carry to my master resolving to take a whole bevy up to the heights at day light and storm it literally unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us
her father shall see her i vowed and vowed again if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to prevent it
i had gone down stairs at three clock to fetch a jug of water and was passing through the hall with it in my hand when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump
oh it is green i said recollecting myself only green and i went on intending to send somebody else to open it but the knock was repeated not loud and still importunately
the four men came back unaccompanied also happily i was spared the journey and the trouble i put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself
the harvest moon shone clear outside it was not the attorney my own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing ellen_dean ellen_dean
is papa alive yes i cried yes my angel he is god be thanked you are safe with us again
she wanted to run breathless as she was up stairs to mr mrs_linton_heathcliff room but i compelled her to sit down on a chair and made her drink and washed her pale face chafing it into a faint colour with my apron
then i said i must go first and tell of her arrival imploring her to say she should be happy with young mr_heathcliff
she stared but soon comprehending why i counselled her to utter the falsehood she assured me she would not complain i couldnt abide to be present at their meeting
i stood outside the chamber door a quarter of an hour and hardly ventured near the bed then all was composed however catherine_earnshaw despair was as silent as her father joy
she supported him calmly in appearance and he fixed on her features his raised eye that seemed dilating with ecstasy he died blissfully mr_lockwood he died so
and never stirred or spoke again but continued that rapt radiant gaze till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed
kissing her cheek he murmured i am going to her and you darling child shall come to us none could have noticed the exact minute of his death it was so entirely without a struggle
whether catherine_earnshaw had spent her tears or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow she sat there dry eyed till the sun rose she sat till noon and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed but i insisted on her coming away and taking some repose
it was well i succeeded in removing her for at dinner time appeared the lawyer having called at wuthering heights to get his instructions how to behave
he had sold himself to mr_heathcliff that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master summons fortunately no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter mind to disturb him after his daughter arrival
mr green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place he gave all the servants but me notice to quit
he would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff should not be buried beside his wife but in the chapel with his family
the funeral was hurried over catherine_earnshaw mrs_linton_heathcliff mr_heathcliff now was suffered to stay at the grange till her father corpse had quitted it
there was the will however to hinder that and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions she told me that her anguish had at last spurred mrs_linton_heathcliff to incur the risk of liberating her
she heard the men i sent disputing at the door and she gathered the sense of mr_heathcliff answer it drove her desperate
mrs_linton_heathcliff who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after i left was terrified into fetching the key before his father re ascended
he had the cunning to unlock and re lock the door without shutting it and when he should have gone to bed he begged to sleep with hareton_earnshaw and his petition was granted for once
she dared not try the door lest the dogs should raise an alarm she visited the empty chambers and examined their window and luckily lighting on her mother she got easily out of its lattice and on to the ground by means of the fir tree close by
catherine_earnshaw stole out before break of day her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape notwithstanding his timid contrivances chapter xxix
the evening after the funeral my young lady and i were seated in the library now musing mournfully one of us despairingly on our loss now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future
we had just agreed the best destiny which could await catherine_earnshaw would be a permission to continue resident at the grange at least during mrs_linton_heathcliff life he being allowed to join her there and i to remain as housekeeper
that seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for and yet i did hope and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment and above all my beloved young mistress when a servant one of the discarded ones not yet departed rushed hastily in and said that devil mr_heathcliff was coming through the court should he fasten the door in his face
he made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name he was master and availed himself of the master privilege to walk straight in without saying a word
if we had been mad enough to order that proceeding we had not time the sound of our informant voice directed him to the library he entered and motioning him out shut the door
it was the same room into which he had been ushered as a guest eighteen year before the same moon shone through the window and the same autumn landscape lay outside
we had not yet lighted a candle but all the apartment was visible even to the portraits on the wall the splendid head of mrs_linton_heathcliff and the graceful one of her husband
there was the same man his dark face rather sallower and more composed his frame a stone or two heavier perhaps and no other difference
mr_heathcliff advanced to the hearth time had little altered his person either catherine_earnshaw had risen with an impulse to dash out when she saw him
i come to fetch you home and i hope you ll be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience
i was embarrassed how to punish him when i discovered his part in the business he such a cobweb a pinch would annihilate him but you ll see by his look that he has received his due
i brought him down one evening the day before yesterday and just set him in a chair and never touched him afterwards
stop he said arresting her by the arm no more runnings away where would you go i sent hareton_earnshaw out and we had the room to ourselves
in two hours i called joseph to carry him up again and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost and i fancy he sees me often though i am not near
hareton_earnshaw says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together and calls you to protect him from me and whether you like your precious mate or not you must come he your concern now i yield all my interest in him to you
as you hate them both you not miss them they can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart
why not let catherine_earnshaw continue here i pleaded and send master mrs_linton_heathcliff to her i seeking a tenant for the grange he answered and i want my child about me to be sure
besides that lass owes me her services for her bread i not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after mrs_linton_heathcliff is gone
mrs_linton_heathcliff is all i have to love in the world and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me and me to him you cannot make us hate each other
make haste and get ready now and dont oblige me to compel you i shall said catherine_earnshaw and i defy you to hurt him when i am by and i defy you to frighten me
you are a boastful champion replied mr_heathcliff but i dont like you well enough to hurt him you shall get the full benefit of the torment as long as it lasts
it is not i who will make him hateful to you it is his own sweet spirit he as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences dont expect thanks for this noble devotion
i heard him draw a pleasant picture to zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as i the inclination is there and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength
but i glad i ve a better to forgive it and i know he loves me and for that reason i love him
mr_heathcliff you have nobody to love you and however miserable you make us we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery
i know he has a bad nature said catherine_earnshaw he your son you are miserable are you not lonely like the devil and envious like him
catherine_earnshaw spoke with a kind of dreary triumph she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies
nobody loves you nobody will cry for you when you die i wouldnt be you you shall be sorry to be yourself presently said her father in law if you stand there another minute
in her absence i began to beg for zillah place at the heights offering to resign mine to her but he would suffer it on no account
he bid me be silent and then for the first time allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures
begone witch and get your things she scornfully withdrew having studied mrs_linton_heathcliff he said i shall have that home not because i need it but
he turned abruptly to the fire and continued with what for lack of a better word i must call a smile i ll tell you what i did yesterday
i got the sexton who was digging mrs_linton_heathcliff grave to remove the earth off her coffin lid and i opened it
had hard work to stir me but he said it would change if the air blew on it and so i struck one side of the coffin loose and covered it up not mrs_linton_heathcliff side damn him
i thought once i would have stayed there when i saw her face again it is hers yet he i wish he been soldered in lead
and i bribed the sexton to pull it away when i laid there and slide mine out too i ll have it made so and then by the time mrs_linton_heathcliff gets to us
he ll not know which is which you were very wicked mr_heathcliff i exclaimed were you not ashamed to disturb the dead
i shall be a great deal more comfortable now and you ll have a better chance of keeping me underground when i get there
i disturbed nobody nelly_dean he replied and i gave some ease to myself disturbed her no she has disturbed me night and day through eighteen year incessantly remorselessly till yesternight and yesternight
i dreamt i was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers
i was tranquil and if she had been dissolved into earth or worse what would you have dreamt of then i said
of dissolving with her and being more happy still he answered do you suppose i dread any change of that sort
i expected such a transformation on raising the lid but i better pleased that it should not commence till i share it
besides unless i had received a distinct impression of her passionless features that strange feeling would hardly have been removed it began oddly
you know i was wild after she died and eternally from dawn to dawn praying her to return to me her spirit
i have a strong faith in ghosts i have a conviction that they can and do exist among us the day she was buried there came a fall of snow
i didnt fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late and no one else had business to bring them there
being alone and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us i said to myself i ll have her in my arms again
if she be cold i ll think it is this north wind that chills me and if she be motionless it is sleep
in the evening i went to the churchyard it blew bleak as winter all round was solitary i got a spade from the tool house and began to delve with all my might
it scraped the coffin i fell to work with my hand the wood commenced cracking about the screws i was on the point of attaining my object when it seemed that i heard a sigh from some one above close at the edge of the grave and bending down
if i can only get this off i muttered i wish they may shovel in the earth over us both
and i wrenched at it more desperately still there was another sigh close at my ear i appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet laden wind
i knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by but as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark though it cannot be discerned so certainly i felt that miss_cathy was there not under me but on the earth
a sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb i relinquished my labour of agony and turned consoled at once unspeakably consoled
her presence was with me it remained while i re filled the grave and led me home you may laugh if you will but i was sure i should see her there
i was sure she was with me and i could not help talking to her having reached the heights i rushed eagerly to the door
it was fastened and i remember that accursed catherine_earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance i remember stopping to kick the breath out of him and then hurrying up stairs to my room and hers
i ought to have sweat blood then from the anguish of my yearning from the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse
i looked round impatiently i felt her by me i could almost see her and yet i could not i had not one
she showed herself as she often was in life a devil to me and since then sometimes more and sometimes less i ve been the sport of that intolerable torture
infernal keeping my nerves at such a stretch that if they had not resembled catgut they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of mrs_linton_heathcliff
when i sat in the house with hareton_earnshaw it seemed that on going out i should meet her when i walked on the moors i should meet her coming in
when i went from home i hastened to return she must be somewhere at the heights i was certain and when i slept in her chamber i was beaten out of that
i couldnt lie there for the moment i closed my eye she was either outside the window or sliding back the panels or entering the room or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child and i must open my lids to see
i ve often groaned aloud till that old rascal joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me
and so i opened and closed them a hundred time a night to be always disappointed it racked me now since i ve seen her i pacified a little
it was a strange way of killing not by inches but by fractions of hairbreadths to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen year
mr_heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead his hair clung to it wet with perspiration his eye were fixed on the red embers of the fire the brow not contracted but raised next the temples diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance but imparting a peculiar look of trouble and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject
after a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage and while so occupied catherine_earnshaw entered announcing that she was ready when her pony should be saddled
send that over to morrow said mr_heathcliff to me then turning to her he added you may do without your pony it is a fine evening and you ll need no ponies at wuthering heights for what journeys you take your own feet will serve you
he only half addressed me and i maintained silence i didnt like to hear him talk come along good bye ellen_dean whispered my dear little mistress
as she kissed me her lips felt like ice come and see me ellen_dean dont forget take care you do no such thing mrs ellen_dean
said her new father when i wish to speak to you i ll come here i want none of your prying at my house
he signed her to precede him and casting back a look that cut my heart she obeyed i watched them from the window walk down the garden
mr_heathcliff fixed catherine_earnshaw arm under his though she disputed the act at first evidently and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley whose trees concealed them
i have paid a visit to the heights but i have not seen her since she left joseph held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her and wouldnt let me pass
zillah has told me something of the way they go on otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living
chapter xxx he said mrs_linton_heathcliff was thrang and the master was not in she thinks catherine_earnshaw haughty and does not like her i can guess by her talk
my young lady asked some aid of her when she first came but mr_heathcliff told her to follow her own business and let his daughter in law look after herself and zillah willingly acquiesced being a narrow minded selfish woman
catherine_earnshaw evinced a child annoyance at this neglect repaid it with contempt and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies as securely as if she had done her some great wrong
i had a long talk with zillah about six weeks ago a little before you came one day when we foregathered on the moor and this is what she told me
the first thing mrs_linton_heathcliff did she said on her arrival at the heights was to run up stairs without even wishing good evening to me and joseph she shut herself into mrs_linton_heathcliff room and remained till morning
then while the master and catherine_earnshaw were at breakfast she entered the house and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for
we know that answered mr_heathcliff but his life is not worth a farthing and i wont spend a farthing on him
her cousin was very ill but i cannot tell how to do she said and if nobody will help me he ll die
none here care what becomes of him if you do act the nurse if you do not lock him up and leave him
then she began to bother me and i said i had enough plague with the tiresome thing we each had our tasks and hers was to wait on mrs_linton_heathcliff
walk out of the room cried the master and let me never hear a word more about him mr_heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her
i fancy he fretted a great deal and moaned hisseln night and day and she had precious little rest one could guess by her white face and heavy eye
she sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like and looked as if she would fain beg assistance but i was not going to disobey the master
though i thought it wrong that mr_kenneth should not be sent for it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain and i always refused to meddle
once or twice after we had gone to bed i ve happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs top and then i ve shut myself in quick for fear of being moved to interfere
how they managed together i cant tell i never dare disobey him mrs ellen_dean and i did pity her then i sure still i didnt wish to lose my place you know
at last one night she came boldly into my chamber and frightened me out of my wits by saying tell mr_heathcliff that his son is dying i sure he is this time
get up instantly and tell him having uttered this speech she vanished again i lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling
nothing stirred the house was quiet she mistaken i said to myself he got over it i neednt disturb them and i began to doze
but my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bell the only bell we have put up on purpose for mrs_linton_heathcliff and the master called to me to see what was the matter and inform them that he wouldnt have that noise repeated
i delivered catherine_earnshaw message he cursed to himself and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle and proceeded to their room
her father in law went up held the light to mrs_linton_heathcliff face looked at him and touched him afterwards he turned to her
i followed mrs mr_heathcliff was seated by the bedside with her hand folded on her knees now catherine_earnshaw he said how do you feel
he safe and i free she answered i should feel well but she continued with a bitterness she couldnt conceal you have left me so long to struggle against death alone that i feel and see only death
she was dumb how do you feel catherine_earnshaw he repeated i feel like death and she looked like it too
hareton_earnshaw and joseph who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet and heard our talk from outside now entered
joseph was fain i believe of the lad removal hareton_earnshaw seemed a thought bothered though he was more taken up with staring at catherine_earnshaw than thinking of mrs_linton_heathcliff
i gave her a little wine but the master bid him get off to bed again we didnt want his help
he afterwards made joseph remove the body to his chamber and told me to return to mine and mrs mr_heathcliff remained by herself
in the morning he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast she had undressed and appeared going to sleep and said she was ill at which i hardly wondered
i informed mr_heathcliff and he replied well let her be till after the funeral and go up now and then to get her what is needful and as soon as she seems better tell me
miss_cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight according to zillah who visited her twice a day and would have been rather more friendly but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled
he had bequeathed the whole of his and what had been her moveable property to his father the poor creature was threatened or coaxed into that act during her week absence when his uncle died
mr_heathcliff went up once to show her mrs_linton_heathcliff will the lands being a minor he could not meddle with however mr_heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his wife right and
his also i suppose legally at any rate catherine_earnshaw destitute of cash and friends cannot disturb his possession nobody said zillah ever approached her door except that once but i and nobody asked anything about her
she had cried out when i carried up her dinner that she couldnt bear any longer being in the cold and i told her the master was going to thrushcross_grange and catherine_earnshaw and i neednt hinder her from descending so as soon as she heard mr_heathcliff horse trot off she made her appearance donned in black and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a quaker she couldnt comb them out
joseph and i generally go to chapel on sundays the kirk you know has no minister now explained mrs ellen_dean and they call the methodists or baptists place i cant say which it is at gimmerton_kirk a chapel
the first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a sunday afternoon joseph had gone she continued but i thought proper to bide at home
young folks are always the better for an elder over looking and hareton_earnshaw with all his bashfulness isnt a model of nice behaviour
i let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us and she had been always used to see the sabbath respected so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone while she stayed
he coloured up at the news and cast his eye over his hand and clothes the train oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute
i saw he meant to give her his company and i guessed by his way he wanted to be presentable so laughing as i durst not laugh when the master is by
i offered to help him if he would and joked at his confusion he grew sullen and began to swear
now mrs ellen_dean zillah went on seeing me not pleased by her manner you happen think your young lady too fine for mr hareton_earnshaw and happen you re right but i own i should love well to bring her pride a peg lower
and what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her now she as poor as you or i poorer i ll be bound you re saying and i doing my little all that road
hareton_earnshaw allowed zillah to give him her aid and she flattered him into a good humour so when catherine_earnshaw came half forgetting her former insults he tried to make himself agreeable by the housekeeper account
missis walked in she said as chill as an icicle and as high as a princess i got up and offered her my seat in the arm chair
catherine_earnshaw rose too and bid her come to the settle and sit close by the fire he was sure she was starved
no she turned up her nose at my civility i ve been starved a month and more she answered resting on the word as scornful as she could
having sat till she was warm she began to look round and discovered a number of books on the dresser she was instantly upon her feet again stretching to reach them but they were too high up
her cousin after watching her endeavours a while at last summoned courage to help her she held her frock and he filled it with the first that came to hand
and she got a chair for herself and placed it at a distance from both of us that was a great advance for the lad
she didnt thank him still he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance and ventured to stand behind as she examined them and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book
his attention became by degrees quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls her face he couldnt see and she couldnt see him
and perhaps not quite awake to what he did but attracted like a child to a candle at last he proceeded from staring to touching he put out his hand and stroked one curl as gently as if it were a bird
she continued reading or seeking for something to read he might have stuck a knife into her neck she started round in such a taking
get away this moment how dare you touch me why are you stopping there she cried in a tone of disgust
mr hareton_earnshaw recoiled looking as foolish as he could do he sat down in the settle very quiet and she continued turning over her volumes another half hour finally catherine_earnshaw crossed over and whispered to me
i cant endure you i ll go upstairs again if you come near me will you ask her to read to us zillah
i stalled of doing naught and i do like i could like to hear her dunnot say i wanted it but ask of yourseln
mr hareton_earnshaw wishes you would read to us ma am i said immediately he take it very kind he be much obliged
she frowned and looking up answered mr hareton_earnshaw and the whole set of you will be good enough to understand that i reject any pretence at kindness
when i would have given my life for one kind word even to see one of your faces you all kept off
you have the hypocrisy to offer i despise you and will have nothing to say to any of you but i wont complain to you
i driven down here by the cold not either to amuse you or enjoy your society what could i ha done began catherine_earnshaw
how was i to blame oh you are an exception answered mrs mr_heathcliff i never missed such a concern as you
but i offered more than once and asked he said kindling up at her pertness i asked mr_heathcliff to let me wake for you be silent
i ll go out of door or anywhere rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear said my lady
hareton_earnshaw muttered she might go to hell for him and unslinging his gun restrained himself from his sunday occupation no longer
he talked now freely enough and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude but the frost had set in and in spite of her pride she was forced to condescend to our company more and more
however i took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature ever since i ve been as stiff as herself and she has no lover or liker among us and she does not deserve one for let them say the least word to her and she ll curl back without respect of any one
she ll snap at the master himself and as good as dares him to thrash her and the more hurt she gets the more venomous she grows
at first on hearing this account from zillah i determined to leave my situation take a cottage and get catherine_earnshaw to come and live with me but mr_heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up hareton_earnshaw in an independent house and i can see no remedy at present unless she could marry again and that scheme
notwithstanding the doctor prophecy i am rapidly recovering strength and though it be only the second week in january i propose getting out on horseback in a day or two and riding over to wuthering heights to inform my landlord that i shall spend the next six months in london and if he likes he may look out for another tenant to take the place after october
it does not come within my province to arrange thus ended mrs ellen_dean story i would not pass another winter here for much
i went to the heights as i proposed my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady and i did not refuse for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request
the front door stood open but the jealous gate was fastened as at my last visit i knocked and invoked catherine_earnshaw from among the garden beds he unchained it and i entered
i took particular notice of him this time but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages
chapter xxxi yesterday was bright calm and frosty the fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen i asked if mr_heathcliff were at home
it was eleven clock and i announced my intention of going in and waiting for him at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me in the office of watchdog not as a substitute for the host
we entered together catherine_earnshaw was there making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal she looked more sulky and less spirited than when i had seen her first
she hardly raised her eye to notice me and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before never returning my bow and good morning by the slightest acknowledgment
he answered no but he would be in at dinner time she does not seem so amiable i thought as mrs ellen_dean would persuade me to believe
she a beauty it is true but not an angel catherine_earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen
remove them yourself she said pushing them from her as soon as she had done and retiring to a stool by the window where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip parings in her lap
i approached her pretending to desire a view of the garden and as i fancied adroitly dropped mrs ellen_dean note on to her knee unnoticed by hareton_earnshaw but she asked aloud what is that
a letter from your old acquaintance the housekeeper at the grange i answered annoyed at her exposing my kind deed and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own
she would gladly have gathered it up at this information but hareton_earnshaw beat her he seized and put it in his waistcoat saying mr_heathcliff should look at it first
thereat catherine_earnshaw silently turned her face from us and very stealthily drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eye and her cousin after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her as ungraciously as he could
catherine_earnshaw caught and perused it eagerly then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates rational and irrational of her former home and gazing towards the hills murmured in soliloquy i should like to be riding minny down there
and she leant her pretty head back against the sill with half a yawn and half a sigh and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her
and chucked it off i should like to be climbing up there oh i tired i stalled hareton_earnshaw mrs mr_heathcliff i said after sitting some time mute you are not aware that i am an acquaintance of yours
my housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you and she ll be greatly disappointed if i return with no news of or from you except that you received her letter and said nothing
so intimate that i think it strange you wont come and speak to me she appeared to wonder at this speech and asked does ellen_dean like you
you must tell her she continued that i would answer her letter but i have no materials for writing not even a book from which i might tear a leaf no books
yes very well i replied hesitatingly i exclaimed how do you contrive to live here without them if i may take the liberty to inquire
though provided with a large library i frequently very dull at the grange take my books away and i should be desperate i was always reading when i had them said catherine_earnshaw and mr_heathcliff never reads so he took it into his head to destroy my books
only once i searched through joseph store of theology to his great irritation and once hareton_earnshaw i came upon a secret stock in your room some latin and greek and some tales and poetry all old friends
i have not had a glimpse of one for weeks i brought the last here and you gathered them as a magpie gathers silver spoons for the mere love of stealing
they are of no use to you or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that as you cannot enjoy them nobody else shall
but i ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart and you cannot deprive me of those
catherine_earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations
perhaps your envy counselled mr_heathcliff to rob me of my treasures mr hareton_earnshaw is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge i said coming to his rescue
he is not envious but emulous of your attainments he ll be a clever scholar in a few year and he wants me to sink into a dunce meantime answered catherine_earnshaw
yes i hear him trying to spell and read to himself and pretty blunders he makes i wish you would repeat chevy chase as you did yesterday it was extremely funny
i heard you and i heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard word and then cursing because you couldnt read their explanations
the young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance and then laughed at for trying to remove it
i had a similar notion and remembering mrs ellen_dean anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared
i observed but mrs mr_heathcliff we have each had a commencement and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us we should stumble and totter yet
she replied i dont wish to limit his acquirements still he has no right to appropriate what is mine and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations
those books both prose and verse are consecrated to me by other associations and i hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth
besides of all he has selected my favourite pieces that i love the most to repeat as if out of deliberate malice
hareton_earnshaw chest heaved in silence a minute he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath which it was no easy task to suppress
i rose and from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment took up my station in the doorway surveying the external prospect as i stood
he followed my example and left the room but presently reappeared bearing half a dozen volumes in his hand which he threw into catherine_earnshaw lap exclaiming take them
oh i never want to hear or read or think of them again i wont have them now she answered
she opened one that had obviously been often turned over and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner then laughed and threw it from her
i shall connect them with you and hate them and listen she continued provokingly commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion
but his self love would endure no further torment i heard and not altogether disapprovingly a manual check given to her saucy tongue
the little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin sensitive though uncultivated feelings and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account and repaying its effects on the inflictor
he afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire i read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen
i fancied that as they consumed he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted and the triumph and ever increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them and i fancied i guessed the incitement to his secret studies also
shame at her scorn and hope of her approval were his first prompters to higher pursuits and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result
he had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments till catherine_earnshaw crossed his path yes that all the good that such a brute as you can get from them
cried catherine_earnshaw sucking her damaged lip and watching the conflagration with indignant eye you better hold your tongue now he answered fiercely
but ere he had crossed the door stones mr_heathcliff coming up the causeway encountered him and laying hold of his shoulder
and his agitation precluded further speech he advanced hastily to the entrance where i made way for him to pass asked what to do now my lad
naught naught he said and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude mr_heathcliff gazed after him and sighed
it will be odd if i thwart myself he muttered unconscious that i was behind him but when i look for his father in his face i find her every day more
how the devil is he so like i can hardly bear to see him he bent his eye to the ground and walked moodily in
there was a restless anxious expression in his countenance i had never remarked there before and he looked sparer in person
i glad to see you out of door again mr_lockwood he said in reply to my greeting from selfish motives partly i dont think i could readily supply your loss in this desolation
his daughter in law on perceiving him through the window immediately escaped to the kitchen so that i remained alone i ve wondered more than once what brought you here
i shall set out for london next week and i must give you warning that i feel no disposition to retain thrushcross_grange beyond the twelve months i agreed to rent it
an idle whim i fear sir was my answer or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away i believe i shall not live there any more
but if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you wont occupy your journey is useless i never relent in exacting my due from any one
oh indeed you re tired of being banished from the world are you he said i coming to plead off nothing about it i exclaimed considerably irritated
should you wish it i ll settle with you now and i drew my note book from my pocket no no he replied coolly you ll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts if you fail to return
i not in such a hurry sit down and take your dinner with us a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome
catherine_earnshaw bring the things in where are you catherine_earnshaw reappeared bearing a tray of knives and forks you may get your dinner with joseph muttered mr_heathcliff aside and remain in the kitchen till he is gone
she obeyed his directions very punctually perhaps she had no temptation to transgress living among clowns and misanthropists she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them
with mr_heathcliff grim and saturnine on the one hand and hareton_earnshaw absolutely dumb on the other i made a somewhat cheerless meal and bade adieu early
i would have departed by the back way to get a last glimpse of catherine_earnshaw and annoy old joseph but hareton_earnshaw received orders to lead up my horse and my host himself escorted me to the door so i could not fulfil my wish
what a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for mrs_linton_heathcliff mr_heathcliff had she and i struck up an attachment as her good nurse desired and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town
this september i was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north and on my journey to his abode i unexpectedly came within fifteen mile of gimmerton_kirk
the ostler at a roadside public house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses when a cart of very green oats newly reaped passed by and he remarked yon frough gimmerton_kirk nah
how dreary life gets over in that house i reflected while riding down the road chapter xxxii they re allas three wick after
other folk wi ther harvest gimmerton_kirk i repeated my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy ah i know
how far is it from this happen fourteen mile er th hills and a rough road he answered a sudden impulse seized me to visit thrushcross_grange
it was scarcely noon and i conceived that i might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn
besides i could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again
having rested awhile i directed my servant to inquire the way to the village and with great fatigue to our beasts we managed the distance in some three hours
i left him there and proceeded down the valley alone the grey church looked greyer and the lonely churchyard lonelier i distinguished a moor sheep cropping the short turf on the graves
it was sweet warm weather too warm for travelling but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below had i seen it nearer august
in winter nothing more dreary in summer nothing more divine than those glens shut in by hills and those bluff bold swells of heath
i reached the grange before sunset and knocked for admittance but the family had retreated into the back premises i judged by one thin blue wreath curling from the kitchen chimney and they did not hear
under the porch a girl of nine or ten sat knitting and an old woman reclined on the housesteps smoking a meditative pipe
i sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes i rode into the court is mrs ellen_dean within
i demanded of the dame mistress ellen_dean nay she answered she doesnt bide here shoo up at th heights are you the housekeeper then
i continued eea aw keep th hause she replied well i mr_lockwood the master are there any rooms to lodge me in i wonder
i wish to stay all nightt maister she cried in astonishment whet whoiver knew yah wur coming yah sud ha send word
she threw down her pipe and bustled in the girl followed and i entered too soon perceiving that her report was true and moreover that i had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition i bade her be composed
i would go out for a walk and meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting room for me to sup in and a bedroom to sleep in
they nowt norther dry nor mensful abahtt place nowt there isnt no sweeping and dusting only good fire and dry sheets were necessary
she seemed willing to do her best though she thrust the hearth brush into the grates in mistake for the poker and malappropriated several other articles of her craft but i retired confiding in her energy for a resting place against my return
wuthering heights was the goal of my proposed excursion an afterthought brought me back when i had quitted the court
all well at the heights i inquired of the woman eea r owt ee knaw she answered skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders
i would have asked why mrs ellen_dean had deserted the grange but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis so i turned away and made my exit rambling leisurely along with the glow of a sinking sun behind and the mild glory of a rising moon in front one fading and the other brightening as i quitted the park and climbed the stony by road branching off to mr_heathcliff dwelling
before i arrived in sight of it all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west but i could see every pebble on the path and every blade of grass by that splendid moon
and i noticed another by the aid of my nostrils a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit trees
both door and lattices were open and yet as is usually the case in a coal district a fine red fire illumined the chimney the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable
but the house of wuthering heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the window
i could both see them and hear them talk before i entered and looked and listened in consequence being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy that grew as i lingered
i had neither to climb the gate nor to knock it yielded to my hand that is an improvement i thought con trary said a voice as sweet as a silver bell
that for the third time you dunce i not going to tell you again recollect or i ll pull your hair
contrary then answered another in deep but softened tones and now kiss me for minding so well no read it over first correctly without a single mistake
the male speaker began to read he was a young man respectably dressed and seated at a table having a book before him
his handsome features glowed with pleasure and his eye kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention
its owner stood behind her light shining ringlets blending at intervals with his brown looks as she bent to superintend his studies and her face it was lucky he could not see her face or he would never have been so steady
i could and i bit my lip in spite at having thrown away the chance i might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiting beauty
the task was done not free from further blunders but the pupil claimed a reward and received at least five kisses which however he generously returned
then they came to the door and from their conversation i judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors
i supposed i should be condemned in hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw heart if not by his mouth to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if i showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then and feeling very mean and malignant i skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen
there was unobstructed admittance on that side also and at the door sat my old friend nelly_dean ellen_dean sewing and singing a song which was often interrupted from within by harsh word of scorn and intolerance uttered in far from musical accents
i rayther by th haulf hev em swearing i my lugs fro morn to neeght nor hearken ye hahsiver said the tenant of the kitchen in answer to an unheard speech of nelly_dean
it a blazing shame that i cannot oppent blessed book but yah set up them glories to sattan and allt flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th warld
oh ye re a raight nowt and shoo another and that poor lad ll be lost atween ye poor lad he added with a groan he witched
i sartin ont oh lord judge em for there norther law nor justice among wer rullers no or we should be sitting in flaming fagots i suppose retorted the singer
but wisht old man and read your bible like a christian and never mind me this is fairy annie wedding a bonny tune it goes to a dance
mrs ellen_dean was about to recommence when i advanced and recognising me directly she jumped to her feet crying why bless you mr_lockwood
how could you think of returning in this way all shut up at thrushcross_grange you should have given us notice
i ve arranged to be accommodated there for as long as i shall stay i answered i depart again to morrow and how are you transplanted here mrs ellen_dean tell me that
zillah left and mr_heathcliff wished me to come soon after you went to london and stay till you returned but step in pray
from the grange i replied and while they make me lodging room there i want to finish my business with your master because i dont think of having another opportunity in a hurry
have you walked from gimmerton_kirk this evening what business sir said nelly_dean conducting me into the house he gone out at present and wont return soon
about the rent i answered oh then it is with mrs mr_heathcliff you must settle she observed or rather with me
she has not learnt to manage her affairs yet and i act for her there nobody else i looked surprised
ah you have not heard of mr_heathcliff death i see she continued mr_heathcliff dead i exclaimed astonished how long ago
three months since but sit down and let me take your hat and i ll tell you all about it stop you have had nothing to eat have you
i want nothing i have ordered supper at home you sit down too i never dreamt of his dying let me hear how it came to pass
you say you dont expect them back for some time the young people no i have to scold them every evening for their late rambles but they dont care for me
she hastened to fetch it before i could refuse and i heard joseph asking whether it warnt a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life
at least have a drink of our old ale it will do you good you seem weary and then to get them jocks out ot maister cellar
she did not stay to retaliate but re entered in a minute bearing a reaming silver pint whose contents i lauded with becoming earnestness
he fair shaamed to bide still and see it and afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of mr_heathcliff history he had a queer end as she expressed it
i was summoned to wuthering heights within a fortnight of your leaving us she said and i obeyed joyfully for catherine_earnshaw sake
mr_heathcliff did not explain his reason for taking a new mind about my coming here he only told me he wanted me and he was tired of seeing catherine_earnshaw
my first interview with her grieved and shocked me she had altered so much since our separation i must make the little parlour my sitting room and keep her with me
she seemed pleased at this arrangement and by degrees i smuggled over a great number of books and other articles that had formed her amusement at the grange and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort
it was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day the delusion did not last long
for one thing she was forbidden to move out of the garden and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on for another in following the house i was forced to quit her frequently and she complained of loneliness
catherine_earnshaw contented at first in a brief space grew irritable and restless she preferred quarrelling with joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude
i did not mind their skirmishes but hareton_earnshaw was often obliged to seek the kitchen also when the master wanted to have the house to himself
and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach or quietly joined in my occupation and shunned remarking or addressing him
and though he was always as sullen and silent as possible after a while she changed her behaviour and became incapable of letting him alone talking at him commenting on his stupidity and idleness expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire and dozing
he just like a dog is he not ellen_dean she once observed or a cart horse he does his work eats his food and sleeps eternally
what a blank dreary mind he must have do you ever dream hareton_earnshaw and if you do what is it about
but you cant speak to me then she looked at him but he would neither open his mouth nor look again
he perhaps dreaming now she continued he twitched his shoulder as juno twitches hers ask him ellen_dean mr hareton_earnshaw will ask the master to send you up stairs if you dont behave
i said he had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist as if tempted to use it i know why hareton_earnshaw never speaks when i am in the kitchen she exclaimed on another occasion
he began to teach himself to read once and because i laughed he burned his books and dropped it was he not a fool were not you naughty
he is afraid i shall laugh at him ellen_dean what do you think i said answer me that perhaps i was she went on but i did not expect him to be so silly
she placed one she had been perusing on his hand he flung it off and muttered if she did not give over he would break her neck
hareton_earnshaw if i gave you a book would you take it now i ll try well i shall put it here she said in the table drawer and i going to bed
then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it and departed but he would not come near it and so i informed her in the morning to her great disappointment
i saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself she had done it effectually
but her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury while i ironed or pursued other such stationary employments as i could not well do in the parlour she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me
when hareton_earnshaw was there she generally paused in an interesting part and left the book lying about that she did repeatedly but he was as obstinate as a mule and instead of snatching at her bait in wet weather he took to smoking with joseph and they sat like automatons one on each side of the fire the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense as he would have called it the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it
on fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions and catherine_earnshaw yawned and sighed and teased me to talk to her and ran off into the court or garden the moment i began and as a last resource cried and said she was tired of living her life was useless
mr_heathcliff who grew more and more disinclined to society had almost banished catherine_earnshaw from his apartment owing to an accident at the commencement of march he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen
his gun burst while out on the hills by himself a splinter cut his arm and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home
it suited catherine_earnshaw to have him there at any rate it made her hate her room up stairs more than ever and she would compel me to find out business below that she might accompany me
on easter monday joseph went to gimmerton_kirk fair with some cattle and in the afternoon i was busy getting up linen in the kitchen
catherine_earnshaw sat morose as usual at the chimney corner and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window panes varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs and whispered ejaculations and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin who steadfastly smoked and looked into the grate
the consequence was that perforce he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity till he made it up again at a notice that i could do with her no longer intercepting my light she removed to the hearthstone
i bestowed little attention on her proceedings but presently i heard her begin i ve found out hareton_earnshaw that i want that i glad that i should like you to be my cousin now if you had not grown so cross to me and so rough
hareton_earnshaw returned no answer hareton_earnshaw hareton hareton_earnshaw do you hear she continued get off wi ye he growled with uncompromising gruffness
let me take that pipe she said cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth before he could attempt to recover it it was broken and behind the fire
stop she cried you must listen to me first and i cant speak while those clouds are floating in my face
he swore at her and seized another will you go to the devil he exclaimed ferociously and let me be
no she persisted i wont i cant tell what to do to make you talk to me and you are determined not to understand
when i call you stupid i dont mean anything i dont mean that i despise you come you shall take notice of me hareton_earnshaw
you are my cousin and you shall own me i shall have naught to do wi you and your mucky pride and your damned mocking tricks
he answered i ll go to hell body and soul before i look sideways after you again side out ot gate now this minute
catherine_earnshaw frowned and retreated to the window seat chewing her lip and endeavouring by humming an eccentric tune to conceal a growing tendency to sob
it would do you a great deal of good it would make you another man to have her for a companion a companion
you should be friends with your cousin mr hareton_earnshaw i interrupted since she repents of her sauciness he cried when she hates me and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon
nay if it made me a king i not be scorned for seeking her good will any more it is not i who hate you it is you who hate me
wept miss_cathy no longer disguising her trouble you hate me as much as mr_heathcliff does and more you re a damned liar began catherine_earnshaw why have i made him angry by taking your part then a hundred time
and that when you sneered at and despised me and go on plaguing me and i ll step in yonder and say you worried me out of the kitchen
i didnt know you took my part she answered drying her eye and i was miserable and bitter at everybody but now i thank you and beg you to forgive me
what can i do besides she returned to the hearth and frankly extended her hand he blackened and scowled like a thunder cloud and kept his fists resolutely clenched and his gaze fixed on the ground
that prompted this dogged conduct for after remaining an instant undecided she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss
the little rogue thought i had not seen her and drawing back she took her former station by the window quite demurely
catherine_earnshaw by instinct must have divined it was obdurate perversity and not dislike i shook my head reprovingly and then she blushed and whispered well
he wouldnt shake hand and he wouldnt look i must show him some way that i like him that i want to be friends
whether the kiss convinced hareton_earnshaw i cannot tell he was very careful for some minutes that his face should not be seen and when he did raise it he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eye
catherine_earnshaw employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper and having tied it with a bit of ribbon and addressed it to mr hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw she desired me to be her ambassadress and convey the present to its destined recipient
and tell him if he ll take it i ll come and teach him to read it right she said and if he refuse it i ll go upstairs and never tease him again
what should i have done ellen_dean i carried it and repeated the message anxiously watched by my employer hareton_earnshaw would not open his fingers so i laid it on his knee
catherine_earnshaw leaned her head and arms on the table till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed then she stole away and quietly seated herself beside her cousin
he trembled and his face glowed all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him he could not summon courage at first to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look and her murmured petition
he did not strike it off either i returned to my work say you forgive me hareton_earnshaw do you can make me so happy by speaking that little word
nay you ll be ashamed of me every day of your life he answered and the more ashamed the more you know me and i cannot bide it
he muttered something inaudible and you ll be my friend added catherine_earnshaw interrogatively so you wont be my friend she said smiling as sweet as honey and creeping close up
i overheard no further distinguishable talk but on looking round again i perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book that i did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides and the enemies were thenceforth sworn allies
the work they studied was full of costly pictures and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till joseph came home
he poor man was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of catherine_earnshaw seated on the same bench with hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw leaning her hand on his shoulder and confounded at his favourite endurance of her proximity it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night
his emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew as he solemnly spread his large bible on the table and overlaid it with dirty bank notes from his pocket book the produce of the day transactions
at length he summoned hareton_earnshaw from his seat tak these in tot maister lad he said and bide there
i gang up to my own rahm this hoile neither mensful nor seemly for us we mun side out and seearch another
come catherine_earnshaw i said we must side out too i ve done my ironing are you ready to go it is not eight clock
hareton_earnshaw i ll leave this book upon the chimney piece and i ll bring some more to morrow ony books that yah leave i shall tak into th hahse said joseph and it ll be mitch if yah find em agean soa yah may plase yerseln
miss_cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers and smiling as she passed hareton_earnshaw went singing up stairs lighter of heart i venture to say than ever she had been under that roof before except perhaps during her earliest visits to mrs_linton_heathcliff
catherine_earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish and my young lady was no philosopher and no paragon of patience but both their mind tending to the same point one loving and desiring to esteem and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed they contrived in the end to reach it
she answered rising unwillingly the intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly though it encountered temporary interruptions you see mr_lockwood it was easy enough to win mrs mr_heathcliff heart
but now i glad you did not try the crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two
i shall envy no one on their wedding day there wont be a happier woman than myself in england chapter xxxiii
on the morrow of that monday catherine_earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments and therefore remaining about the house i speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me as heretofore
she got downstairs before me and out into the garden where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work and when i went to bid them come to breakfast
i saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the grange
i was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief half hour the black currant trees were the apple of joseph eye and she had just fixed her choice of a flower bed in the midst of them
there that will be all shown to the master i exclaimed the minute it is discovered and what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden
we shall have a fine explosion on the head of it see if we dont mr hareton_earnshaw i wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding
i forgotten they were joseph answered catherine_earnshaw rather puzzled but i ll tell him i did it we always ate our meals with mr_heathcliff
catherine_earnshaw usually sat by me but to day she stole nearer to hareton_earnshaw and i presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility
now mind you dont talk with and notice your cousin too much were my whispered instructions as we entered the room
i held the mistress post in making tea and carving so i was indispensable at table it will certainly annoy mr_heathcliff and he ll be mad at you both
i not going to she answered the minute after she had sidled to him and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge
he dared not speak to her there he dared hardly look and yet she went on teasing till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh
i frowned and then she glanced towards the master whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company as his countenance evinced and she grew serious for an instant scrutinizing him with deep gravity
mr_heathcliff started his eye rapidly surveyed our faces catherine_earnshaw met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance which he abhorred
afterwards she turned and recommenced her nonsense at last hareton_earnshaw uttered a smothered laugh it is well you are out of my reach he exclaimed
what fiend possesses you to stare back at me continually with those infernal eye down with them and dont remind me of your existence again
i thought i had cured you of laughing it was me muttered hareton_earnshaw what do you say demanded the master
hareton_earnshaw looked at his plate and did not repeat the confession mr_heathcliff looked at him a bit and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing
we had nearly finished and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder so i anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting when joseph appeared at the door revealing by his quivering lip and furious eye that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected
he must have seen miss_cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud and rendered his speech difficult to understand he began
i sarved fur sixty year and i thowt i lug my books up intot garret and all my bits stuff and they sud hevt kitchen to theirseln fort sake quietness

thank god shoo cannot stalet sowl nob dy shoo wer niver soa handsome but what a body mud look at her bout winking
it yon flaysome graceless quean that witched our lad wi her bold een and her forrard ways till nay it fair brusts my heart
he forgotten all i ve done for him and made on him and goan and riven up a whole row ot grandest currant trees
it garden and here he lamented outright unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries and catherine_earnshaw ingratitude and dangerous condition
is the fool drunk asked mr_heathcliff hareton_earnshaw is it you he finding fault with i ve pulled up two or three bushes replied the young man but i going to set em again
and why have you pulled them up said the master catherine_earnshaw wisely put in her tongue we wanted to plant some flowers there she cried
i the only person to blame for i wished him to do it and who the devil gave you leave to touch a stick about the place demanded her father in law much surprised
the latter was speechless his cousin replied you shouldnt grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament when you have taken all my land your land insolent slut
and my money she continued returning his angry glare and meantime biting a piece of crust the remnant of her breakfast
and who ordered you to obey her he added turning to hareton_earnshaw you never had any said mr_heathcliff silence he exclaimed
get done and begone and hareton_earnshaw land and his money pursued the reckless thing hareton_earnshaw and i are friends now and i shall tell him all about you
the master seemed confounded a moment he grew pale and rose up eyeing her all the while with an expression of mortal hate
if you strike me hareton_earnshaw will strike you she said so you may as well sit down if hareton_earnshaw does not turn you out of the room i ll strike him to hell thundered mr_heathcliff
damnable witch dare you pretend to rouse him against me off with her do you hear fling her into the kitchen
i ll kill her ellen_dean if you let her come into my sight again hareton_earnshaw tried under his breath to persuade her to go
drag her away he cried savagely are you staying to talk and he approached to execute his own command
he ll not obey you wicked man any more said catherine_earnshaw and he ll soon detest you as much as i do
wisht wisht muttered the young man reproachfully i will not hear you speak so to him have done but you wont let him strike me
she cried come then he whispered earnestly it was too late mr_heathcliff had caught hold of her now you go
he said to catherine_earnshaw accursed witch this time she has provoked me when i could not bear it and i ll make her repent it for ever
he had his hand in her hair hareton_earnshaw attempted to release her locks entreating him not to hurt her that once
mr_heathcliff black eye flashed he seemed ready to tear catherine_earnshaw in pieces and i was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue when of a sudden his fingers relaxed he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm and gazed intently in her face
then he drew his hand over his eye stood a moment to collect himself apparently and turning anew to catherine_earnshaw said with assumed calmness you must learn to avoid putting me in a passion or i shall really murder you some time
as to hareton_earnshaw catherine_earnshaw if i see him listen to you i ll send him seeking his bread where he can get it
go with mrs ellen_dean and keep with her and confine your insolence to her ears your love will make him an outcast and a beggar
i led my young lady out she was too glad of her escape to resist the other followed and mr_heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner
i had counselled catherine_earnshaw to dine up stairs but as soon as he perceived her vacant seat he sent me to call her
he spoke to none of us ate very little and went out directly afterwards intimating that he should not return before evening
the two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence where i heard hareton_earnshaw sternly check his cousin on her offering a revelation of her father in law conduct to his father
nelly_dean take her and leave me all of you leave me he said he wouldnt suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement
if he were the devil it didnt signify he would stand by him and he rather she would abuse himself as she used to than begin on mr_heathcliff
catherine_earnshaw was waxing cross at this but he found means to make her hold her tongue by asking how she would like him to speak ill of her father
then she comprehended that catherine_earnshaw took the master reputation home to himself and was attached by ties stronger than reason could break chains forged by habit which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen
she showed a good heart thenceforth in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning mr_heathcliff and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and hareton_earnshaw indeed i dont believe she has ever breathed a syllable in the latter hearing against her oppressor since
when this slight disagreement was over they were friends again and as busy as possible in their several occupation of pupil and teacher
i came in to sit with them after i had done my work and i felt so soothed and comforted to watch them that i did not notice how time got on
i had long been proud of one and now i was sure the other would be a source of equal satisfaction
his honest warm and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred and catherine_earnshaw sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry
his brightening mind brightened his features and added spirit and nobility to their aspect i could hardly fancy it the same individual i had beheld on the day i discovered my little lady at wuthering heights after her expedition to the crags
you know they both appeared in a measure my child while i admired and they laboured dusk drew on and with it returned the master
he came upon us quite unexpectedly entering by the front way and had a full view of the whole three ere we could raise our head to glance at him
well i reflected there was never a pleasanter or more harmless sight and it will be a burning shame to scold them
the red fire light glowed on their two bonny head and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of child for though he was twenty three and she eighteen each had so much of novelty to feel and learn that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity
they lifted their eye together to encounter mr_heathcliff perhaps you have never remarked that their eye are precisely similar and they are those of catherine_earnshaw
the present catherine_earnshaw has no other likeness to her except a breadth of forehead and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty whether she will or not
with hareton_earnshaw the resemblance is carried farther it is singular at all time then it was particularly striking because his senses were alert and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity
i suppose this resemblance disarmed mr_heathcliff he walked to the hearth in evident agitation but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man or i should say altered its character for it was there yet
he took the book from his hand and glanced at the open page then returned it without any observation merely signing catherine_earnshaw away her companion lingered very little behind her and i was about to depart also but he bid me sit still
it is a poor conclusion is it not he observed having brooded awhile on the scene he had just witnessed an absurd termination to my violent exertions
i get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses and train myself to be capable of working like hercules and when everything is ready and in my power i find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished
my old enemies have not beaten me now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives i could do it and none could hinder me
but where is the use i dont care for striking i cant take the trouble to raise my hand that sounds as if i had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity
it is far from being the case i have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction and i am too idle to destroy for nothing
nelly_dean there is a strange change approaching i in its shadow at present i take so little interest in my daily life that i hardly remember to eat and drink
those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me and that appearance causes me pain amounting to agony
about her i wont speak and i dont desire to think but i earnestly wish she were invisible her presence invokes only maddening sensations
you ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so he added making an effort to smile if i try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies
but you ll not talk of what i tell you and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself it is tempting at last to turn it out to another
five minutes ago hareton_earnshaw seemed a personification of my youth not a human being i felt to him in such a variety of ways that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally
he moves me differently and yet if i could do it without seeming insane i never see him again in the first place his startling likeness to catherine_earnshaw connected him fearfully with her
that however which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination is actually the least for what is not connected with her to me
and what does not recall her i cannot look down to this floor but her features are shaped in the flags
in every cloud in every tree filling the air at night and caught by glimpses in every object by day i am surrounded with her image
the most ordinary faces of men and women my own features mock me with a resemblance the entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist and that i have lost her
well hareton_earnshaw aspect was the ghost of my immortal love of my wild endeavours to hold my right my degradation my pride my happiness and my anguish
but it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you only it will let you know why with a reluctance to be always alone his society is no benefit rather an aggravation of the constant torment i suffer and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together
i said alarmed at his manner though he was neither in danger of losing his senses nor dying according to my judgment he was quite strong and healthy and as to his reason from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things and entertaining odd fancies
he might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine
i can give them no attention any more but what do you mean by a change mr_heathcliff i shall not know that till it comes he said i only half conscious of it now
you have no feeling of illness have you i asked no nelly_dean i have not he answered then you are not afraid of death
i pursued afraid no he replied i have neither a fear nor a presentiment nor a hope of death
with my hard constitution and temperate mode of living and unperilous occupation i ought to and probably shall remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head
why should i and yet i cannot continue in this condition i have to remind myself to breathe almost to remind my heart to beat
and it is like bending back a stiff spring it is by compulsion that i do the slightest act not prompted by one thought and by compulsion that i notice anything alive or dead which is not associated with one universal idea
they have yearned towards it so long and so unwaveringly that i convinced it will be reached and soon because it has devoured my existence i am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment
i have a single wish and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it my confessions have not relieved me but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which i show
he began to pace the room muttering terrible things to himself till i was inclined to believe as he said joseph did that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell
though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind even by looks it was his habitual mood i had no doubt he asserted it himself but not a soul from his general bearing would have conjectured the fact
you did not when you saw him mr_lockwood and at the period of which i speak he was just the same as then only fonder of continued solitude and perhaps still more laconic in company
o god it is a long fight i wish it were over i wondered greatly how it would end chapter xxxiv
for some days after that evening mr_heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals yet he would not consent formally to exclude hareton_earnshaw and miss_cathy
he had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings choosing rather to absent himself and eating once in twenty four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him
one night after the family were in bed i heard him go downstairs and out at the front door i did not hear him re enter and in the morning i found he was still away
we were in april then the weather was sweet and warm the grass as green as showers and sun could make it and the two dwarf apple trees near the southern wall in full bloom
after breakfast catherine_earnshaw insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir trees at the end of the house and she beguiled hareton_earnshaw who had perfectly recovered from his accident to dig and arrange her little garden which was shifted to that corner by the influence of joseph complaints
i was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around and the beautiful soft blue overhead when my young lady who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border returned only half laden and informed us that mr_heathcliff was coming in
and he spoke to me she added with a perplexed countenance what did he say asked hareton_earnshaw he told me to begone as fast as i could she answered
but he looked so different from his usual look that i stopped a moment to stare at him how he inquired
night walking amuses him then i remarked affecting a careless manner in reality as surprised as she was and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement for to see the master looking glad would not be an every day spectacle
why almost bright and cheerful no almost nothing very much excited and wild and glad she replied i framed an excuse to go in
mr_heathcliff stood at the open door he was pale and he trembled yet certainly he had a strange joyful glitter in his eye that altered the aspect of his whole face
will you have some breakfast i said you must be hungry rambling about all night i wanted to discover where he had been but i did not like to ask directly
no i not hungry he answered averting his head and speaking rather contemptuously as if he guessed i was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour
i dont think it right to wander out of door i observed instead of being in bed it is not wise at any rate this moist season
i felt perplexed i didnt know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition i daresay you ll catch a bad cold or a fever you have something the matter with you now
nothing but what i can bear he replied and with the greatest pleasure provided you ll leave me alone get in and dont annoy me
i obeyed and in passing i noticed he breathed as fast as a cat yes i reflected to myself we shall have a fit of illness
that noon he sat down to dinner with us and received a heaped up plate from my hand as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting
i ve neither cold nor fever nelly_dean he remarked in allusion to my morning speech and i ready to do justice to the food you give me
i cannot conceive what he has been doing he took his knife and fork and was going to commence eating when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct
we saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal and catherine_earnshaw said he go and ask why he would not dine
he laid them on the table looked eagerly towards the window then rose and went out he thought we had grieved him some way
nay he answered but he not angry he seemed rarely pleased indeed only i made him impatient by speaking to him twice and then he bid me be off to you he wondered how i could want the company of anybody else
i set his plate to keep warm on the fender and after an hour or two he re entered when the room was clear in no degree calmer the same unnatural it was unnatural appearance of joy under his black brow the same bloodless hue and his teeth visible now and then in a kind of smile his frame shivering not as one shivers with chill or weakness but as a tight stretched cord vibrates a strong thrilling rather than trembling
well is he coming cried catherine_earnshaw when her cousin returned i will ask what is the matter i thought or who should
and i exclaimed have you heard any good news mr_heathcliff you look uncommonly animated where should good news come from to me
your dinner is here i returned why wont you get it i dont want it now he muttered hastily i ll wait till supper
he said i animated with hunger and seemingly i must not eat and nelly_dean once for all let me beg you to warn hareton_earnshaw and the other away from me
i wish to be troubled by nobody i wish to have this place to myself is there some new reason for this banishment
i not putting the question through idle curiosity but you are putting the question through very idle curiosity he interrupted with a laugh
i inquired tell me why you are so queer mr_heathcliff where were you last night yet i ll answer it
last night i was on the threshold of hell to day i am within sight of my heaven i have my eye on it hardly three feet to sever me
and now you better go you ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you if you refrain from prying having swept the hearth and wiped the table i departed more perplexed than ever
he did not quit the house again that afternoon and no one intruded on his solitude till at eight clock i deemed it proper though unsummoned to carry a candle and his supper to him
he was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice but not looking out his face was turned to the interior gloom
the fire had smouldered to ashes the room was filled with the damp mild air of the cloudy evening and so still that not only the murmur of the beck down gimmerton_kirk was distinguishable but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles or through the large stones which it could not cover
i uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate and commenced shutting the casements one after another till i came to his
must i close this i asked in order to rouse him for he would not stir the light flashed on his features as i spoke
oh mr_lockwood i cannot express what a terrible start i got by the momentary view those deep black eye that smile and ghastly paleness
it appeared to me not mr_heathcliff but a goblin and in my terror i let the candle bend towards the wall and it left me in darkness
yes close it he replied in his familiar voice there that is pure awkwardness why did you hold the candle horizontally
i hurried out in a foolish state of dread and said to joseph the master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire
joseph rattled some fire into the shovel and went but he brought it back immediately with the supper tray in his other hand explaining that mr_heathcliff was going to bed and he wanted nothing to eat till morning
we heard him mount the stairs directly he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber but turned into that with the panelled bed its window as i mentioned before is wide enough for anybody to get through and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion of which he had rather we had no suspicion
be quick and bring another for i dared not go in myself again just then is he a ghoul or a vampire
and then i set myself to reflect how i had tended him in infancy and watched him grow to youth and followed him almost through his whole course and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror
i mused i had read of such hideous incarnate demons but where did he come from the little dark thing harboured by a good man to his bane
and i began half dreaming to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him and repeating my waking meditations i tracked his existence over again with grim variations at last picturing his death and funeral of which all i can remember is being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument and consulting the sexton about it and as he had no surname and we could not tell his age we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word mr_heathcliff
muttered superstition as i dozed into unconsciousness that came true we were if you enter the kirkyard you ll read on his headstone only that and the date of his death
i rose and went into the garden as soon as i could see to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window
dawn restored me to common sense there were none he has stayed at home i thought and he ll be all right to day
i prepared breakfast for the household as was my usual custom but told hareton_earnshaw and catherine_earnshaw to get theirs ere the master came down for he lay late
they preferred taking it out of door under the trees and i set a little table to accommodate them on my re entrance i found mr_heathcliff below
he and joseph were conversing about some farming business he gave clear minute directions concerning the matter discussed but he spoke rapidly and turned his head continually aside and had the same excited expression even more exaggerated
when joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose and i put a basin of coffee before him
he drew it nearer and then rested his arms on the table and looked at the opposite wall as i supposed surveying one particular portion up and down with glittering restless eye and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together
come now i exclaimed pushing some bread against his hand eat and drink that while it is hot it has been waiting near an hour
he didnt notice me and yet he smiled i rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so mr_heathcliff
master i cried dont for god sake stare as if you saw an unearthly vision dont for god sake shout so loud he replied
turn round and tell me are we by ourselves of course was my answer of course we are still i involuntarily obeyed him as if i was not quite sure
with a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things and leant forward to gaze more at his ease
now i perceived he was not looking at the wall for when i regarded him alone it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards distance
and whatever it was it communicated apparently both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes at least the anguished yet raptured expression of his countenance suggested that idea
the fancied object was not fixed either his eye pursued it with unwearied diligence and even in speaking to me were never weaned away
i vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread his fingers clenched before they reached it and remained on the table forgetful of their aim
i sat a model of patience trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation till he grew irritable and got up asking why i would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals and saying that on the next occasion i neednt wait i might set the things down and go
having uttered these word he left the house slowly sauntered down the garden path and disappeared through the gate the hours crept anxiously by another evening came
i did not retire to rest till late and when i did i could not sleep he returned after midnight and instead of going to bed shut himself into the room beneath
i listened and tossed about and finally dressed and descended it was too irksome to lie there harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings
i distinguished mr_heathcliff step restlessly measuring the floor and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration resembling a groan
he muttered detached word also the only one i could catch was the name of catherine_earnshaw coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering and spoken as one would speak to a person present low and earnest and wrung from the depth of his soul
i had not courage to walk straight into the apartment but i desired to divert him from his reverie and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire stirred it and began to scrape the cinders
it drew him forth sooner than i expected he opened the door immediately and said nelly_dean come here is it morning come in with your light
it is striking four i answered you want a candle to take up stairs you might have lit one at this fire
no i dont wish to go up stairs he said come in and kindle me a fire and do anything there is to do about the room
he roamed to and fro meantime in a state approaching distraction his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between
when day breaks i ll send for green he said i wish to make some legal inquiries of him while i can bestow a thought on those matters and while i can act calmly
i must blow the coals red first before i can carry any i replied getting a chair and the bellows i have not written my will yet and how to leave my property
i wish i could annihilate it from the face of the earth i would not talk so mr_heathcliff i interposed
i never expected that your nerves would be disordered they are at present marvellously so however and almost entirely through your own fault
i cannot determine let your will be a while you ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet the way you ve passed these three last days might knock up a titan
do take some food and some repose you need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both
your cheeks are hollow and your eye blood shot like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep
it is not my fault that i cannot eat or rest he replied i assure you it is through no settled designs
i ll do both as soon as i possibly can but you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arms length of the shore
i must reach it first and then i ll rest well never mind mr green as to repenting of my injustices i ve done no injustice and i repent of nothing
i too happy and yet i not happy enough my soul bliss kills my body but does not satisfy itself
happy master i cried strange happiness if you would hear me without being angry i might offer some advice that would make you happier
you are aware mr_heathcliff i said that from the time you were thirteen year old you have lived a selfish unchristian life and probably hardly had a bible in your hand during all that period
what is that he asked give it you must have forgotten the contents of the book and you may not have space to search it now
could it be hurtful to send for some one some minister of any denomination it does not matter which to explain it and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts and how unfit you will be for its heaven unless a change takes place before you die i rather obliged than angry nelly_dean he said for you remind me of the manner in which i desire to be buried
you and hareton_earnshaw may if you please accompany me and mind particularly to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins
no minister need come nor need anything be said over me i tell you i have nearly attained my heaven and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me
and supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast and died by that means and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk
it is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening i said shocked at his godless indifference how would you like it
they wont do that he replied if they did you must have me removed secretly and if you neglect it you shall prove practically that the dead are not annihilated
as soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den and i breathed freer
but in the afternoon while joseph and hareton_earnshaw were at their work he came into the kitchen again and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the house he wanted somebody with him
i declined telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me and i had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone
i believe you think me a fiend he said with his dismal laugh something too horrible to live under a decent roof
then turning to catherine_earnshaw who was there and who drew behind me at his approach he added half sneeringly will you come chuck
i ll not hurt you no to you i ve made myself worse than the devil well there is one who wont shrink from my company
by god she relentless oh damn it it unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear even mine he solicited the society of no one more
at dusk he went into his chamber through the whole night and far into the morning we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself
when he came and i requested admittance and tried to open the door i found it locked and mr_heathcliff bid us be damned
hareton_earnshaw was anxious to enter but i bid him fetch mr_kenneth and he should go in and see him he was better and would be left alone so the doctor went away
the following evening was very wet indeed it poured down till day dawn and as i took my morning walk round the house i observed the master window swinging open and the rain driving straight in
he cannot be in bed i thought those showers would drench him through he must either be up or out but i ll make no more ado i ll go boldly and look
having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key i ran to unclose the panels for the chamber was vacant quickly pushing them aside i peeped in
mr_heathcliff was there laid on his back his eye met mine so keen and fierce i started and then he seemed to smile
i could not think him dead but his face and throat were washed with rain the bed clothes dripped and he was perfectly still
the lattice flapping to and fro had grazed one hand that rested on the sill no blood trickled from the broken skin and when i put my fingers to it i could doubt no more he was dead and stark
i hasped the window i combed his black long hair from his forehead i tried to close his eye to extinguish if possible that frightful life like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it
they would not shut they seemed to sneer at my attempts and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too
taken with another fit of cowardice i cried out for joseph joseph shuffled up and made a noise but resolutely refused to meddle with him
th divil harried off his soul he cried and he may hev his carcass intot bargin for aught i care
i thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed but suddenly composing himself he fell on his knees and raised his hand and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights
i felt stunned by the awful event and my memory unavoidably recurred to former time with a sort of oppressive sadness
ech what a wicked un he looks girning at death and the old sinner grinned in mockery but poor hareton_earnshaw the most wronged was the only one who really suffered much
he pressed its hand and kissed the sarcastic savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart though it be tough as tempered steel
he sat by the corpse all night weeping in bitter earnest mr_kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died
i concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days fearing it might lead to trouble and then i am persuaded he did not abstain on purpose it was the consequence of his strange illness not the cause
we buried him to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood as he wished catherine_earnshaw and i the sexton and six men to carry the coffin comprehended the whole attendance
hareton_earnshaw with a streaming face dug green sods and laid them over the brown mould himself at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds and i hope its tenant sleeps as soundly
but the country folks if you ask them would swear on the bible that he walks there are those who speak to having met him near the church and on the moor and even within this house
idle tales you ll say and so say i yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago
the six men departed when they had let it down into the grave we stayed to see it covered i was going to the grange one evening a dark evening threatening thunder and
just at the turn of the heights i encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him he was crying terribly and i supposed the lambs were skittish and would not be guided
what is the matter my little man i asked there mr_heathcliff and a woman yonder undert nab he blubbered un i darnut pass em
i saw nothing but neither the sheep nor he would go on so i bid him take the road lower down
he probably raised the phantoms from thinking as he traversed the moors alone on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat
yet still i dont like being out in the dark now and i dont like being left by myself in this grim house i cannot help it i shall be glad when they leave it and shift to the grange
they are going to the grange then i said yes answered mrs ellen_dean as soon as they are married and that will be on new year day
and who will live here then why joseph will take care of the house and perhaps a lad to keep him company
they will live in the kitchen and the rest will be shut up for the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it
i observed no mr_lockwood said nelly_dean shaking her head i believe the dead are at peace but it is not right to speak of them with levity
at that moment the garden gate swung to the ramblers were returning they are afraid of nothing i grumbled watching their approach through the window
as they stepped on to the door stones and halted to take a last look at the moon or more correctly at each other by her light i felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again and pressing a remembrance into the hand of mrs ellen_dean and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness i vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house door and so should have confirmed joseph in his opinion of his fellow servant gay indiscretions had he not fortunately recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet
together they would brave satan and all his legions my walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk
when beneath its walls i perceived decay had made progress even in seven months many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass and slates jutted off here and there beyond the right line of the roof to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms
i sought and soon discovered the three headstones on the slope next the moor the middle one grey and half buried in the heath mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot mr_heathcliff still bare
i lingered round them under that benign sky watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth
