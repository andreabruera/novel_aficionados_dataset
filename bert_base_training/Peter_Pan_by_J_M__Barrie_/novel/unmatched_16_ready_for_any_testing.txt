chapter peter_pan breaks through all child except one grow up they soon know that they will grow up and the way wendy knew was this
one day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother
i suppose she must have looked rather delightful for mrs_darling put her hand to her heart and cried oh why cant you remain like this for ever
this was all that passed between them on the subject but henceforth wendy knew that she must grow up you always know after you are two
of course they lived at their house number on their street and until wendy came her mother was the chief one
two is the beginning of the end she was a lovely lady with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth
her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes one within the other that come from the puzzling east however many you discover there is always one more and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that wendy could never get though there it was perfectly conspicuous in the right hand corner
the way mr_darling won her was this the many gentlemen who had been boy when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her and they all ran to her house to propose to her except mr_darling who took a cab and nipped in first and so he got her
he got all of her except the innermost box and the kiss he never knew about the box and in time he gave up trying for the kiss
wendy thought napoleon could have got it but i can picture him trying and then going off in a passion slamming the door
mr_darling used to boast to wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him he was one of those deep one who know about stocks and shares
of course no one really knows but he quite seemed to know and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him
mrs_darling was married in white and at first she kept the books perfectly almost gleefully as if it were a game not so much as a brussels sprout was missing but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out and instead of them there were pictures of babies without face
she drew them when she should have been totting up they were mrs_darling guesses wendy came first then john then michael
for a week or two after wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her as she was another mouth to feed
mr_darling was frightfully proud of her but he was very honourable and he sat on the edge of mrs_darling bed holding her hand and calculating expenses while she looked at him imploringly
she wanted to risk it come what might but that was not his way his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again
i have one pound seventeen here and two and six at the office i can cut off my coffee at the office say ten shillings making two nine and six with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven with five naught naught in my cheque book makes eight nine seven who is that moving eight nine seven dot and carry seven dont speak my own and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door quiet child dot and carry child there you ve done it did
now dont interrupt he would beg of her i say nine nine seven yes i said nine nine seven the question is can we try it for a year on nine nine seven
of course we can george_darling she cried but she was prejudiced in wendy favour and he was really the grander character of the two
remember mumps he warned her almost threateningly and off he went again mumps one pound that is what i have put down but i daresay it will be more like thirty shillings
dont speak measles one five german measles half a guinea makes two fifteen six dont waggle your finger whooping cough say fifteen shillings and
so on it went and it added up differently each time but at last wendy just got through with mumps reduced to twelve six and the two kinds of measles treated as one
there was the same excitement over john and michael had even a narrower squeak but both were kept and soon you might have seen the three of them going in a row to miss fulsom kindergarten school accompanied by their nurse
mrs_darling loved to have everything just so and mr_darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours so of course they had a nurse
as they were poor owing to the amount of milk the child drank this nurse was a prim newfoundland dog called nana who had belonged to no one in particular until the darlings engaged her
she had always thought child important however and the darlings had become acquainted with her in kensington gardens where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators and was much hated by careless nursemaids whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses
how thorough she was at bath time and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry
she had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat
she believed to her last day in old fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf and made sound of contempt over all this new fangled talk about germs and so on
it was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the child to school walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved and butting them back into line if they strayed
she proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse of course her kennel was in the nursery on john footer in england soccer was called football footer for short day
she never once forgot his sweater and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain there is a room in the basement of miss fulsom school where the nurses wait
they sat on forms while nana lay on the floor but that was the only difference they affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves and she despised their light talk
she resented visits to the nursery from mrs_darling friends but if they did come she first whipped off michael pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding and smoothed out wendy and made a dash at john hair
no nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly and mr_darling knew it yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked
he had his position in the city to consider nana also troubled him in another way he had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him
i know she admires you tremendously george_darling mrs_darling would assure him and then she would sign to the child to be specially nice to father
such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid cap though she had sworn when engaged that she would never see ten again
lovely dances followed in which the only other servant liza was sometimes allowed to join the gaiety of those romps
and gayest of all was mrs_darling who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it
there never was a simpler happier family until the coming of peter_pan mrs_darling first heard of peter_pan when she was tidying up her child minds
it is the nightly custom of every good mother after her child are asleep to rummage in their minds and put thing straight for next morning repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day
if you could keep awake but of course you cant you would see your own mother doing this and you would find it very interesting to watch her
you would see her on her knees i expect lingering humorously over some of your contents wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up making discoveries sweet and not so sweet pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten and hurriedly stowing that out of sight
when you wake in the morning the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top beautifully aired are spread out your prettier thoughts ready for you to put on
it is quite like tidying up drawers i dont know whether you have ever seen a map of a person mind
doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you and your own map can become intensely interesting but catch them trying to draw a map of a child mind which is not only confused but keeps going round all the time
there are zigzag lines on it just like your temperature on a card and these are probably roads in the island for the neverland is always more or less an island with astonishing splashes of colour here and there and coral reefs and rakish looking craft in the offing and savages and lonely lairs and gnomes who are mostly tailors and caves through which a river runs and princes with six elder brothers and a hut fast going to decay and one very small old lady with a hooked nose
it would be an easy map if that were all but there is also first day at school religion father the round pond needle work murders hangings verbs that take the dative chocolate pudding day getting into braces say ninety nine three pence for pulling out your tooth yourself and so on and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through and it is all rather confusing especially as nothing will stand still
john for instance had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which john was shooting while michael who was very small had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it
john lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands michael in a wigwam wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together
john had no friends michael had friends at night wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents but on the whole the neverlands have a family resemblance and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other nose and so forth
of course the neverlands vary a good deal on these magic shores child at play are for ever beaching their coracles simple
boat we too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more
of all delectable island the neverland is the snuggest and most compact not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances between one adventure and another but nicely crammed
when you play at it by day with the chairs and table cloth it is not in the least alarming but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real
occasionally in her travels through her child minds mrs_darling found thing she could not understand and of these quite the most perplexing was the word peter_pan
she knew of no peter_pan and yet he was here and there in john and michael minds while wendy began to be scrawled all over with him
the name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words and as mrs_darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance
that is why there are night light yes he is rather cocky wendy admitted with regret her mother had been questioning her
at first mrs_darling did not know but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a peter_pan who was said to live with the fairy
there were odd story about him as that when child died he went part of the way with them so that they should not be frightened
she had believed in him at the time but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person
but who is he my pet he is peter_pan you know mother besides she said to wendy he would be grown up by this time
she meant that he was her size in both mind and body she didnt know how she knew she just knew it
oh no he isnt grown up wendy assured her confidently and he is just my size mrs_darling consulted mr_darling but he smiled pooh pooh
mark my words he said it is some nonsense nana has been putting into their heads just the sort of idea a dog would have
leave it alone and it will blow over but it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave mrs_darling quite a shock
for instance they may remember to mention a week after the event happened that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him
child have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them it was in this casual way that wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation
some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor which certainly were not there when the child went to bed and mrs_darling was puzzling over them when wendy said with a tolerant smile i do believe it is that peter_pan again
whatever do you mean wendy it is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet wendy said sighing she was a tidy child
she explained in quite a matter of fact way that she thought peter_pan sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her
unfortunately she never woke so she didnt know how she knew she just knew what nonsense you talk precious no one can get into the house without knocking
i think he comes in by the window she said my love it is three floors up were not the leaves at the foot of the window mother
mrs_darling did not know what to think for it all seemed so natural to wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming
it was quite true the leaves had been found very near the window my child the mother cried why did you not tell me of this before
i forgot said wendy lightly she was in a hurry to get her breakfast oh surely she must have been dreaming
mrs_darling examined them very carefully they were skeleton leaves but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in england
but on the other hand there were the leaves she crawled about the floor peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot
she let down a tape from the window to the pavement and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet without so much as a spout to climb up by
but wendy had not been dreaming as the very next night showed the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these child may be said to have begun
she rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls certainly wendy had been dreaming on the night we speak of all the child were once more in bed
it happened to be nana evening off and mrs_darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep
all were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew
the fire was warm however and the nursery dimly lit by three night light and presently the sewing lay on mrs_darling lap
it was something for michael who on his birthday was getting into shirts then her head nodded oh so gracefully she was asleep
look at the four of them wendy and michael over there john here and mrs_darling by the fire there should have been a fourth night light
while she slept she had a dream she dreamt that the neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it
he did not alarm her for she thought she had seen him before in the face of many women who have no child
but in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the neverland and she saw wendy and john and michael peeping through the gap
the dream by itself would have been a trifle but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open and a boy did drop on the floor
he was accompanied by a strange light no bigger than your fist which darted about the room like a living thing
perhaps he is to be found in the face of some mother also and i think it must have been this light that wakened mrs_darling
she started up with a cry and saw the boy and somehow she knew at once that he was peter_pan
if you or i or wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like mrs_darling kiss
the juices that ooze out of tree but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth
he was a lovely boy clad in skeleton leaves and when he saw she was a grown up he gnashed the little pearls at her
chapter the shadow mrs_darling screamed and as if in answer to a bell the door opened and nana entered returned from her evening out
again mrs_darling screamed this time in distress for him for she thought he was killed and she ran down into the street to look for his little body but it was not there and she looked up and in the black night she could see nothing
she growled and sprang at the boy who leapt lightly through the window but what she thought was a shooting star
as he leapt at the window nana had closed it quickly too late to catch him but his shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and snapped it off
she returned to the nursery and found nana with something in her mouth which proved to be the boy shadow you may be sure mrs_darling examined the shadow carefully but it was quite the ordinary kind
she hung it out at the window meaning he is sure to come back for it let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the child
but unfortunately mrs_darling could not leave it hanging out at the window it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house
she thought of showing it to mr_darling but he was totting up winter great coats for john and michael with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear and it seemed a shame to trouble him besides she knew exactly what he would say it all comes of having a dog for a nurse
she decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband
nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow ah me the opportunity came a week later on that never to be forgotten friday
i ought to have been specially careful on a friday she used to say afterwards to her husband while perhaps nana was on the other side of her holding her hand
of course it was a friday no no mr_darling always said i am responsible for it all i george_darling did it
they sat thus night after night recalling that fatal friday till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the face on a bad coinage
mea culpa mea culpa he had had a classical education if only i had not accepted that invitation to dine at mrs_darling said
if only i had not poured my medicine into nana bowl said mr_darling if only i had pretended to like the medicine was what nana wet eye said
my liking for parties george_darling my fatal gift of humour dearest my touchiness about trifles dear master and mistress
then one or more of them would break down altogether nana at the thought it true it true they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse
mr_darling would cry and nana bark was the echo of it but mrs_darling never upbraided peter_pan there was something in the right hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call peter_pan names
many a time it was mr_darling who put the handkerchief to nana eye that fiend they would sit there in the empty nursery recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening
it had begun so uneventfully so precisely like a hundred other evenings with nana putting on the water for michael bath and carrying him to it on her back
i wont go to bed he had shouted like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject i wont i wont
nana it isnt six clock yet oh dear oh dear i shant love you any more nana i tell you i wont be bathed i wont i wont
she had dressed early because wendy so loved to see her in her evening gown with the necklace george_darling had given her
then mrs_darling had come in wearing her white evening gown she was wearing wendy bracelet on her arm she had asked for the loan of it
she had found her two older child playing at being herself and father on the occasion of wendy birth and john was saying i am happy to inform you mrs_darling that you are now a mother in just such a tone as mr_darling himself may have used on the real occasion
wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother wendy had danced with joy just as the real mrs_darling must have done
then john was born with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male and michael came from his bath to ask to be born also but john said brutally that they did not want any more
michael had nearly cried nobody wants me he said and of course the lady in the evening dress could not stand that
i do she said i so want a third child boy or girl asked michael not too hopefully
such a little thing for mr and mrs_darling and nana to recall now but not so little if that was to be michael last night in the nursery
boy then he had leapt into her arm they go on with their recollections it was then that i rushed in like a tornado wasnt it
mr_darling would say scorning himself and indeed he had been like a tornado perhaps there was some excuse for him
he too had been dressing for the party and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie
it is an astounding thing to have to tell but this man though he knew about stocks and shares had no real mastery of his tie
sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made up tie
this was such an occasion he came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand
why what is the matter father dear matter he yelled he really yelled this tie it will not tie
he became dangerously sarcastic not round my neck round the bed post oh yes twenty time have i made it up round the bed post but round my neck no
he thought mrs_darling was not sufficiently impressed and he went on sternly i warn you of this mother that unless this tie is round my neck we dont go out to dinner to night and if i dont go out to dinner to night i never go to the office again and if i dont go to the office again you and i starve and our child will be flung into the streets
let me try dear she said and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do and with her nice cool hand she tied his tie for him while the child stood around to see their fate decided
some man would have resented her being able to do it so easily but mr_darling had far too fine a nature for that he thanked her carelessly at once forgot his rage and in another moment was dancing round the room with michael on his back
oh dear no begs to be excused even then mrs_darling was placid how wildly we romped says mrs_darling now recalling it
our last romp mr_darling groaned george_darling do you remember michael suddenly said to me how did you get to know me mother
i remember they were rather sweet dont you think george_darling and they were ours ours and now they are gone
the romp had ended with the appearance of nana and most unluckily mr_darling collided against her covering his trousers with hairs
they were not only new trousers but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming
of course mrs_darling brushed him but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse
george_darling nana is a treasure no doubt but i have an uneasy feeling at time that she looks upon the child as puppies
oh no dear one i feel sure she knows they have souls i wonder mr_darling said thoughtfully i wonder
it was an opportunity his wife felt for telling him about the boy at first he pooh poohed the story but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow
it is nobody i know he said examining it carefully but it does look a scoundrel we were still discussing it you remember says mr_darling when nana came in with michael medicine
you will never carry the bottle in your mouth again nana and it is all my fault strong man though he was there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine
if he had a weakness it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly and so now when michael dodged the spoon in nana mouth he had said reprovingly be a man michael
wont wont michael cried naughtily mrs_darling left the room to get a chocolate for him and mr_darling thought this showed want of firmness
mother dont pamper him he called after her michael when i was your age i took medicine without a murmur
he really thought this was true and wendy who was now in her night gown believed it also and she said to encourage michael that medicine you sometimes take father is much nastier isnt it
ever so much nastier mr_darling said bravely and i would take it now as an example to you michael if i hadnt lost the bottle
he had not exactly lost it he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there
i said thank you kind parents for giving me bottles to make me well what he did not know was that the faithful liza had found it and put it back on his wash stand
i know where it is father wendy cried always glad to be of service i ll bring it and she was off before he could stop her
immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way john he said shuddering it most beastly stuff it that nasty sticky sweet kind
it will soon be over father john said cheerily and then in rushed wendy with the medicine in a glass
i have been as quick as i could she panted you have been wonderfully quick her father retorted with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her
michael first he said doggedly father first said michael who was of a suspicious nature i shall be sick you know mr_darling said threateningly
come on father said john hold your tongue john his father rapped out wendy was quite puzzled i thought you took it quite easily father
that is not the point he retorted the point is that there is more in my glass than in michael spoon
his proud heart was nearly bursting and it isnt fair i would say it though it were with my last breath it isnt fair
father i am waiting said michael coldly it all very well to say you are waiting so am i waiting
father a cowardly custard so are you a cowardly custard i not frightened neither am i frightened
well then take it well then you take it wendy had a splendid idea why not both take it at the same time
wendy gave the words one two three and michael took his medicine but mr_darling slipped his behind his back
certainly said mr_darling are you ready michael there was a yell of rage from michael and father wendy exclaimed
what do you mean by father mr_darling demanded stop that row michael i meant to take mine but i
i missed it it was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him just as if they did not admire him
look here all of you he said entreatingly as soon as nana had gone into the bathroom i have just thought of a splendid joke
it was the colour of milk but the child did not have their father sense of humour and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into nana bowl
i shall pour my medicine into nana bowl and she will drink it thinking it is milk what fun
he said doubtfully and they did not dare expose him when mrs_darling and nana returned nana good dog he said patting her i have put a little milk into your bowl nana
then she gave mr_darling such a look not an angry look she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs and crept into her kennel
nana wagged her tail ran to the medicine and began lapping it mr_darling was frightfully ashamed of himself but he would not give in
in a horrid silence mrs_darling smelt the bowl george_darling she said it your medicine it was only a joke he roared while she comforted her boy and wendy hugged nana
much good he said bitterly my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house and still wendy hugged nana
that right he shouted coddle her nobody coddles me oh dear no i am only the breadwinner why should i be coddled why why why
george_darling mrs_darling entreated him not so loud the servants will hear you somehow they had got into the way of calling liza the servants
let them he answered recklessly bring in the whole world but i refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer
the child wept and nana ran to him beseechingly but he waved her back he felt he was a strong man again
in vain in vain he cried the proper place for you is the yard and there you go to be tied up this instant
george_darling george mrs_darling whispered remember what i told you about that boy alas he would not listen he was determined to show who was master in that house and
when commands would not draw nana from the kennel he lured her out of it with honeyed words and seizing her roughly dragged her from the nursery
he was ashamed of himself and yet he did it it was all owing to his too affectionate nature which craved for admiration
when he had tied her up in the back yard the wretched father went and sat in the passage with his knuckles to his eye
they could hear nana barking and john whimpered it is because he is chaining her up in the yard but wendy was wiser
that is not nana unhappy bark she said little guessing what was about to happen that is her bark when she smells danger
in the meantime mrs_darling had put the child to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night light danger
are you sure wendy oh yes mrs_darling quivered and went to the window it was securely fastened
they were crowding round the house as if curious to see what was to take place there but she did not notice this nor that one or two of the smaller one winked at her
yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry oh how i wish that i wasnt going to a party to night
even michael already half asleep knew that she was perturbed and he asked can anything harm us mother after the night light are lit
she looked out and the night was peppered with stars nothing precious she said they are the eye a mother leaves behind her to guard her child
she went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them and little michael flung his arm round her mother he cried i glad of you
no was only a few yards distant but there had been a slight fall of snow and father and mother darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes
they were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time they were already the only persons in the street and all the stars were watching them
it is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was
so the older one have become glassy eyed and seldom speak winking is the star language but the little one still wonder
they are not really friendly to peter_pan who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to night and anxious to get the grown ups out of the way
so as soon as the door of closed on mr and mrs_darling there was a commotion in the firmament and the smallest of all the stars in the milky way screamed out
stars are beautiful but they may not take an active part in anything they must just look on for ever now peter_pan chapter come away come away
for a moment after mr and mrs_darling left the house the night light by the bed of the three child continued to burn clearly
they were awfully nice little night light and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see peter_pan but wendy light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also and before they could close their mouth all the three went out
there was another light in the room now a thousand time brighter than the night light and in the time we have taken to say this it had been in all the drawers in the nursery looking for peter_pan shadow rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out
it was not really a light it made this light by flashing about so quickly but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy no longer than your hand but still growing
it was a girl called tinker_bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf cut low and square through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage
a moment after the fairy entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars and peter_pan dropped in
she was slightly inclined to embonpoint plump hourglass figure he had carried tinker_bell part of the way and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust
tinker_bell he called softly after making sure that the child were asleep tink where are you she was in a jug for the moment and liking it extremely she had never been in a jug before
oh do come out of that jug and tell me do you know where they put my shadow the loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him
you ordinary child can never hear it but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before
she meant the chest of drawers and peter_pan jumped at the drawers scattering their contents to the floor with both hand as kings toss ha pence to the crowd
in a moment he had recovered his shadow and in his delight he forgot that he had shut tinker_bell up in the drawer
if he thought at all but i dont believe he ever thought it was that he and his shadow when brought near each other would join like drops of water and when they did not he was appalled
it is the fairy language tink said that the shadow was in the big box he tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom but that also failed
a shudder passed through peter_pan and he sat on the floor and cried his sobs woke wendy and she sat up in bed
she was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor she was only pleasantly interested boy she said courteously why are you crying
peter_pan could be exceeding polite also having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies and he rose and bowed to her beautifully
she was much pleased and bowed beautifully to him from the bed what your name he asked
wendy moira angela darling she replied with some satisfaction what is your name peter_pan she was already sure that he must be peter_pan but it did seem a comparatively short name
is that all yes he said rather sharply he felt for the first time that it was a shortish name
i so sorry said wendy moira angela it doesnt matter peter_pan gulped she asked where he lived second to the right said peter_pan and then straight on till morning
what a funny address peter_pan had a sinking for the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address
no it isnt he said i mean wendy said nicely remembering that she was hostess is that what they put on the letters
he wished she had not mentioned letters dont get any letters he said contemptuously but your mother gets letters
dont have a mother he said not only had he no mother but he had not the slightest desire to have one
he thought them very over rated persons wendy however felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy
o peter_pan no wonder you were crying she said and got out of bed and ran to him i wasnt crying about mother he said rather indignantly
i was crying because i cant get my shadow to stick on besides i wasnt crying it has come off
yes then wendy saw the shadow on the floor looking so draggled and she was frightfully sorry for peter_pan
she said but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap
how awful how exactly like a boy fortunately she knew at once what to do it must be sewn on she said just a little patronisingly
what sewn he asked you re dreadfully ignorant no i not but she was exulting in his ignorance
i shall sew it on for you my little man she said though he was tall as herself and she got out her housewife sewing bag and sewed the shadow on to peter_pan foot
i daresay it will hurt a little she warned him oh i shant cry said peter_pan who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life
and he clenched his teeth and did not cry and soon his shadow was behaving properly though still a little creased
perhaps i should have ironed it wendy said thoughtfully but peter_pan boylike was indifferent to appearances and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee
alas he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to wendy he thought he had attached the shadow himself
how clever i am he crowed rapturously oh the cleverness of me it is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of peter_pan was one of his most fascinating qualities
to put it with brutal frankness there never was a cockier boy but for the moment wendy was shocked you conceit braggart she exclaimed with frightful sarcasm of course i did nothing
she replied with hauteur pride if i am no use i can at least withdraw and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets
to induce her to look up he pretended to be going away and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot
you did a little peter_pan said carelessly and continued to dance a little wendy he said dont withdraw i cant help crowing wendy when i pleased with myself
wendy he continued in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist wendy one girl is more use than twenty boy
now wendy was every inch a woman though there were not very many inches and she peeped out of the bed clothes
still she would not look up though she was listening eagerly do you really think so peter_pan
i think it perfectly sweet of you she declared and i ll get up again and she sat with him on the side of the bed
she also said she would give him a kiss if he liked but peter_pan did not know what she meant and he held out his hand expectantly
i shall know when you give it to me he replied stiffly and not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble
yes i do surely you know what a kiss is she asked aghast now said he shall i give you a kiss
she made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck
and she replied with a slight primness if you please it was lucky that she did put it on that chain for it was afterwards to save her life
when people in our set are introduced it is customary for them to ask each other age and so wendy who always liked to do the correct thing asked peter_pan how old he was
it was not really a happy question to ask him it was like an examination paper that asks grammar when what you want to be asked is kings of england
he really knew nothing about it he had merely suspicions but he said at a venture wendy i ran away the day i was born
wendy was quite surprised but interested and she indicated in the charming drawing room manner by a touch on her night gown that he could sit nearer her
it was because i heard father and mother he explained in a low voice talking about what i was to be when i became a man
i dont know he replied uneasily but i am quite young he was extraordinarily agitated now
i dont want ever to be a man he said with passion i want always to be a little boy and to have fun
she gave him a look of the most intense admiration and he thought it was because he had run away but it was really because he knew fairy
so i ran away to kensington gardens and lived a long long time among the fairy wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairy struck her as quite delightful
she poured out questions about them to his surprise for they were rather a nuisance to him getting in his way
and so on and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding spanking still he liked them on the whole and he told her about the beginning of fairy
you see wendy when the first baby laughed for the first time its laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about and that was the beginning of fairy
tedious talk this but being a stay at home she liked it and so he went on good naturedly there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl
you see child know such a lot now they soon dont believe in fairy and every time a child says i dont believe in fairy there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead
really he thought they had now talked enough about fairy and it struck him that tinker_bell was keeping very quiet
ought to be isnt there no i cant think where she has gone to he said rising and he called tink by name
wendy heart went flutter with a sudden thrill peter_pan she cried clutching him you dont mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room
she was here just now he said a little impatiently you dont hear her do you and they both listened
the only sound i hear said wendy is like a tinkle of bells well that tink that the fairy language
i think i hear her too the sound came from the chest of drawers and peter_pan made a merry face
no one could ever look quite so merry as peter_pan and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh he had his first laugh still
wendy he whispered gleefully i do believe i shut her up in the drawer he let poor tink out of the drawer and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury
you shouldnt say such thing peter_pan retorted of course i very sorry but how could i know you were in the drawer
wendy was not listening to him peter_pan she cried if she would only stand still and let me see her
they hardly ever stand still he said but for one moment wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock
the lovely she cried though tink face was still distorted with passion tink said peter_pan amiably this lady says she wishes you were her fairy
tinker_bell answered insolently what does she say peter_pan he had to translate she is not very polite
she says you are a great huge ugly girl and that she is my fairy he tried to argue with tink
you know you cant be my fairy tink because i am an gentleman and you are a lady to this tink replied in these words you silly ass and disappeared into the bathroom
she is quite a common fairy peter_pan explained apologetically she is called tinker_bell because she mends the pots and kettles tinker tin worker
similar to cinder plus elle to get cinderella they were together in the armchair by this time and wendy plied him with more questions
if you dont live in kensington gardens now sometimes i do still but where do you live mostly now
with the lost boy who are they they are the child who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way
if they are not claimed in seven day they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses i captain
what fun it must be yes said cunning peter_pan but we are rather lonely you see we have no female companionship
are none of the others girls oh no girls you know are much too clever to fall out of their prams
this flattered wendy immensely i think she said it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls john there just despises us
this seemed to wendy rather forward for a first meeting and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house
for reply peter_pan rose and kicked john out of bed blankets and all one kick however john continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there
and i know you meant to be kind she said relenting so you may give me a kiss for the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses
i thought you would want it back he said a little bitterly and offered to return her the thimble
oh dear said the nice wendy i dont mean a kiss i mean a thimble what that it like this
she kissed him funny said peter_pan gravely now shall i give you a thimble if you wish to said wendy keeping her head erect this time
peter_pan thimbled her and almost immediately she screeched what is it wendy it was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair
that must have been tink i never knew her so naughty before and indeed tink was darting about again using offensive language
she says she will do that to you wendy every time i give you a thimble but why why tink
peter_pan could not understand why but wendy understood and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to story
again tink replied you silly ass you see i dont know any story none of the lost boy knows any story
how perfectly awful wendy said do you know peter_pan asked why swallows build in the eaves of house it is to listen to the story
o wendy your mother was telling you such a lovely story which story was it about the prince who couldnt find the lady who wore the glass slipper
peter_pan said wendy excitedly that was cinderella and he found her and they lived happily ever after peter_pan was so glad that he rose from the floor where they had been sitting and hurried to the window
where are you going she cried with misgiving to tell the other boy dont go peter_pan she entreated i know such lots of story
he came back and there was a greedy look in his eye now which ought to have alarmed her but did not
those were her precise words so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him
oh the story i could tell to the boy she cried and then peter_pan gripped her and began to draw her toward the window
let me go she ordered him wendy do come with me and tell the other boy of course she was very pleased to be asked but she said oh dear i cant
think of mummy besides i cant fly i ll teach you oh how lovely to fly i ll teach you how to jump on the wind back and then away we go
wendy wendy when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny thing to the stars
oo she exclaimed rapturously oo and wendy there are mermaids mermaids with tails such long tails
oh cried wendy to see a mermaid he had become frightfully cunning wendy he said how we should all respect you
she was wriggling her body in distress it was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor
but he had no pity for her wendy he said the sly one you could tuck us in at night
oo none of us has ever been tucked in at night oo and her arm went out to him and you could darn our clothes and make pockets for us
none of us has any pockets how could she resist of course it awfully fascinating she cried
peter_pan would you teach john and michael to fly too if you like he said indifferently and she ran to john and michael and shook them
wake up she cried peter_pan has come and he is to teach us to fly john rubbed his eye
then i shall get up he said of course he was on the floor already hallo he said i am up
michael was up by this time also looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw but peter_pan suddenly signed silence
their face assumed the awful craftiness of child listening for sound from the grown up world all was as still as salt
then everything was right no stop everything was wrong nana who had been barking distressfully all the evening was quiet now
it was her silence they had heard out with the light hide quick cried john taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure
and thus when liza entered holding nana the nursery seemed quite its old self very dark and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept
liza was in a bad temper for she was mixing the christmas puddings in the kitchen and had been drawn from them with a raisin still on her cheek by nana absurd suspicions
she thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take nana to the nursery for a moment but in custody of course
they were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains there you suspicious brute she said not sorry that nana was in disgrace
they are perfectly safe arent they every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed listen to their gentle breathing
here michael encouraged by his success breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected nana knew that kind of breathing and she tried to drag herself out of liza clutches
i warn you if you bark again i shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party and then oh wont master whip you just
but liza was dense no more of it nana she said sternly pulling her out of the room
she tied the unhappy dog up again but do you think nana ceased to bark bring master and missus home from the party
why that was just what she wanted do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe
unfortunately liza returned to her puddings and nana seeing that no help would come from her strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it
in another moment she had burst into the dining room of and flung up her paws to heaven her most expressive way of making a communication
mr and mrs_darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery and without a good bye to their hostess they rushed into the street
but it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains and peter_pan can do a great deal in ten minutes
we now return to the nursery it all right john announced emerging from his hiding place i say peter_pan can you really fly
instead of troubling to answer him peter_pan flew around the room taking the mantelpiece on the way how topping said john and michael
it looked delightfully easy and they tried it first from the floor and then from the bed but they always went down instead of up
how sweet cried wendy yes i sweet oh i am sweet said peter_pan forgetting his manners again
i say how do you do it asked john rubbing his knee he was quite a practical boy you just think lovely wonderful thoughts peter_pan explained and they lift you up in the air
he showed them again you re so nippy at it john said couldnt you do it very slowly once
peter_pan did it both slowly and quickly i ve got it now wendy cried john but soon he found he had not
not one of them could fly an inch though even michael was in words of two syllables and peter_pan did not know a from
of course peter_pan had been trifling with them for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him
fortunately as we have mentioned one of his hand was messy with it and he blew some on each of them with the most superb results
now just wiggle your shoulders this way he said and let go they were all on their bed and gallant michael let go first
he did not quite mean to let go but he did it and immediately he was borne across the room
i flewed he screamed while still in mid air john let go and met wendy near the bathroom oh lovely
they were not nearly so elegant as peter_pan they could not help kicking a little but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling and there is almost nothing so delicious as that
oh ripping look at me look at me look at me peter_pan gave wendy a hand at first but had to desist tink was so indignant
up and down they went and round and round heavenly was wendy word i say cried john why shouldnt we all go out
of course it was to this that peter_pan had been luring them michael was ready he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles
but wendy hesitated mermaids said peter_pan again oo and there are pirate pirate cried john seizing his sunday hat let us go at once
they ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window and yes it was still shut but the room was ablaze with light and most heart gripping sight of all they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round not on the floor but in the air
it was just at this moment that mr and mrs_darling hurried with nana out of not three figures four
in a tremble they opened the street door mr_darling would have rushed upstairs but mrs_darling signed him to go softly
if so how delightful for them and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief but there will be no story
on the other hand if they are not in time i solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end
she even tried to make her heart go softly will they reach the nursery in time they would have reached the nursery
in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them once again the stars blew the window open and that smallest star of all called out
cave peter_pan then peter_pan knew that there was not a moment to lose come he cried imperiously and soared out at once into the night followed by john and michael and wendy
mr and mrs_darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late the birds were flown chapter the flight second to the right and straight on till morning
that peter_pan had told wendy was the way to the neverland but even birds carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners could not have sighted it with these instructions
at first his companions trusted him implicitly and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy
they recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room
peter_pan you see just said anything that came into his head john and michael raced michael getting a start not long ago
but how long ago they were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb wendy seriously john thought it was their second sea and their third night
did they really feel hungry at time or were they merely pretending because peter_pan had such a jolly new way of feeding them
his way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouth suitable for humans and snatch it from them then the birds would follow and snatch it back and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles parting at last with mutual expressions of good will
but wendy noticed with gentle concern that peter_pan did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter nor even that there are other way
certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy they were sleepy and that was a danger for the moment they popped off down they fell
sometimes it was dark and sometimes light and now they were very cold and again too warm the awful thing was that peter_pan thought this funny
there he goes again he would cry gleefully as michael suddenly dropped like a stone save him save him
eventually peter_pan would dive through the air and catch michael just before he could strike the sea and it was lovely the way he did it but he always waited till the last moment and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life
also he was fond of variety and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go
he could sleep in the air without falling by merely lying on his back and floating but this was partly at least because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster
cried wendy looking with horror at the cruel sea far below do be more polite to him wendy whispered to john when they were playing follow my leader
when playing follow my leader peter_pan would fly close to the water and touch each shark tail in passing just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing
they could not follow him in this with much success so perhaps it was rather like showing off especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed
then tell him to stop showing off said john you must be nice to him wendy impressed on her brothers
what could we do if he were to leave us we could go back michael said how could we ever find our way back without him
well then we could go on said john that is the awful thing john we should have to go on for we dont know how to stop
john said that if the worst came to the worst all they had to do was to go straight on for the world was round and so in time they must come back to their own window
this was true peter_pan had forgotten to show them how to stop and who is to get food for us john
and even though we became good at picking up food see how we bump against clouds and thing if he is not near to give us a hand
i nipped a bit out of that eagle mouth pretty neatly wendy after the twentieth try wendy reminded him
they could now fly strongly though they still kicked far too much but if they saw a cloud in front of them the more they tried to avoid it the more certainly did they bump into it
indeed they were constantly bumping if nana had been with them she would have had a bandage round michael forehead by this time
he could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight to have some adventure in which they had no share
he would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star but he had already forgotten what it was or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening
peter_pan was not with them for the moment and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves it was really rather irritating to child who had never seen a mermaid
and if he forgets them so quickly wendy argued how can we expect that he will go on remembering us
she saw recognition come into his eye as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on once even she had to call him by name
indeed sometimes when he returned he did not remember them at least not well wendy was sure of it i wendy she said agitatedly
i say wendy he whispered to her always if you see me forgetting you just keep on saying i wendy and then i ll remember
however to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several time and found that they could sleep thus with security
indeed they would have slept longer but peter_pan tired quickly of sleeping and soon he would cry in his captain voice we get off here
so with occasional tiffs but on the whole rollicking they drew near the neverland for after many moons they did reach it and what is more they had been going pretty straight all the time not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of peter_pan or tink as because the island was looking for them
he was very sorry of course this was rather unsatisfactory it is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores
indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the child all directed by their friend the sun who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night
there it is said peter_pan calmly where where where all the arrows are pointing wendy and john and michael stood on tip toe in the air to get their first sight of the island
strange to say they all recognized it at once and until fear fell upon them they hailed it not as something long dreamt of and seen at last but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays
john there the lagoon wendy look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand i say john i see your flamingo with the broken leg
look michael there your cave john what that in the brushwood it a wolf with her whelps wendy i do believe that your little whelp
there my boat john with her sides stove in no it isnt why we burned your boat
that her at any rate i say john i see the smoke of the redskin camp where show me and i ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they are on the war path
peter_pan was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand for have i not told you that anon fear fell upon them
there just across the mysterious river i see now yes they are on the war path right enough it came as the arrows went leaving the island in gloom
then unexplored patches arose in it and spread black shadows moved about in them the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now and above all you lost the certainty that you would win
in the old day at home the neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime you were quite glad that the night light were on
you even liked nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here and that the neverland was all make believe
of course the neverland had been make believe in those day but it was real now and there were no night light and it was getting darker every moment and where was nana
his careless manner had gone at last his eye were sparkling and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body
they had been flying apart but they huddled close to peter_pan now they were now over the fearsome island flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet
nothing horrid was visible in the air yet their progress had become slow and laboured exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces
sometimes they hung in the air until peter_pan had beaten on it with his fists they dont want us to land he explained
who are they wendy whispered shuddering but he could not or would not say tinker_bell had been asleep on his shoulder but now he wakened her and sent her on in front
sometimes he poised himself in the air listening intently with his hand to his ear and again he would stare down with eye so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth
having done these thing he went on again his courage was almost appalling would you like an adventure now he said casually to john or would you like to have your tea first
wendy said tea first quickly and michael pressed her hand in gratitude but the braver john hesitated what kind of adventure
he asked cautiously there a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us peter_pan told him if you like we ll go down and kill him
i dont see him john said after a long pause i do suppose john said a little huskily he were to wake up
peter_pan spoke indignantly you dont think i would kill him while he was sleeping i would wake him first and then kill him
that the way i always do i say do you kill many tons john said how ripping but decided to have tea first
he asked if there were many pirate on the island just now and peter_pan said he had never known so many
who is captain now james_hook answered peter_pan and his face became very stern as he said that hated word
jas james_hook ay then indeed michael began to cry and even john could speak in gulps only for they knew james_hook reputation
he was blackbeard bo sun john whispered huskily he is the worst of them all he is the only man of whom barbecue was afraid
that him said peter_pan what is he like is he big he is not so big as he was
how do you mean i cut off a bit of him you yes me said peter_pan sharply i wasnt meaning to be disrespectful
oh all right but i say what bit his right hand then he cant fight now oh cant he just
left hander he has an iron james_hook instead of a right hand and he claws with it claws i say john said peter_pan
yes say ay ay sir ay ay sir there is one thing peter_pan continued that every boy who serves under me has to promise and so must you
john paled it is this if we meet james_hook in open fight you must leave him to me i promise john said loyally
for the moment they were feeling less eerie because tink was flying with them and in her light they could distinguish each other
unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo
wendy quite liked it until peter_pan pointed out the drawbacks she tells me he said that the pirate sighted us before the darkness came and got long tom out
the big gun yes and of course they must see her light and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly
wendy john michael tell her to go away at once peter_pan the three cried simultaneously but he refused she thinks we have lost the way he replied stiffly and she is rather frightened
you dont think i would send her away all by herself when she is frightened for a moment the circle of light was broken and something gave peter_pan a loving little pinch
then tell her wendy begged to put out her light she cant put it out that is about the only thing fairy cant do
it just goes out of itself when she falls asleep same as the stars then tell her to sleep at once john almost ordered
she cant sleep except when she sleepy it is the only other thing fairy cant do seems to me growled john these are the only two thing worth doing
here he got a pinch but not a loving one if only one of us had a pocket peter_pan said we could carry her in it
however they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them
he had a happy idea john hat tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand john carried it though she had hoped to be carried by peter_pan
presently wendy took the hat because john said it struck against his knee as he flew and this as we shall see led to mischief for tinker_bell hated to be under an obligation to wendy
it was the stillest silence they had ever known broken once by a distant lapping which peter_pan explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of tree rubbing together but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives
in the black topper the light was completely hidden and they flew on in silence even these noises ceased to michael the loneliness was dreadful
if only something would make a sound he cried as if in answer to his request the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard
the roar of it echoed through the mountains and the echoes seemed to cry savagely where are they where are they where are they
the pirate had fired long tom at them thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make believe and the same island come true
when at last the heavens were steady again john and michael found themselves alone in the darkness john was treading the air mechanically and michael without knowing how to float was floating
are you shot john whispered tremulously i havent tried myself out yet michael whispered back we know now that no one had been hit
peter_pan however had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea while wendy was blown upwards with no companion but tinker_bell
i dont know whether the idea came suddenly to tink or whether she had planned it on the way but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure wendy to her destruction
it would have been well for wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat tink was not all bad or rather
fairy have to be one thing or the other because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time
she was all bad just now but on the other hand sometimes she was all good they are however allowed to change only it must be a complete change
tinkle wendy could not of course understand and i believe some of it was bad words but it sounded kind and she flew back and forward plainly meaning follow me and all will be well
at present she was full of jealousy of wendy what she said in her lovely what else could poor wendy do
she called to peter_pan and john and michael and got only mocking echoes in reply she did not yet know that tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman
chapter the island come true feeling that peter_pan was on his way back the neverland had again woke into life
and so bewildered and now staggering in her flight she followed tink to her doom we ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened but woke is better and was always used by peter_pan
the fairy take an hour longer in the morning the beasts attend to their young the redskins feed heavily for six day and night and when pirate and lost boy meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other
but with the coming of peter_pan who hates lethargy they are under way again if you put your ear to the ground now you would hear the whole island seething with life
in his absence thing are usually quiet on the island on this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows
the lost boy were out looking for peter_pan the pirate were out looking for the lost boy the redskins were out looking for the pirate and the beasts were out looking for the redskins
they were going round and round the island but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate
the boy on the island vary of course in numbers according as they get killed and so on and when they seem to be growing up which is against the rules peter_pan thins them out but at this time there were six of them counting the twins as two
let us pretend to lie here among the sugar cane and watch them as they steal by in single file each with his hand on his dagger
they are forbidden by peter_pan to look in the least like him and they wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves in which they are so round and furry that when they fall they roll
all wanted blood except the boy who liked it as a rule but to night were out to greet their captain they have therefore become very sure footed
he had been in fewer adventures than any of them because the big thing constantly happened just when he had stepped round the corner all would be quiet he would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood and then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood
this ill luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it so that he was quite the humblest of the boy
the first to pass is tootles not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band poor kind tootles there is danger in the air for you to night
tootles the fairy tink who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool for doing her mischief and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boy
take care lest an adventure is now offered you which if accepted will plunge you in deepest woe ware tinker_bell
would that he could hear us but we are not really on the island and he passes by biting his knuckles
next comes nibs the gay and debonair followed by slightly who cuts whistles out of the tree and dances ecstatically to his own tunes
he thinks he remembers the day before he was lost with their manners and customs and this has given his nose an offensive tilt
curly is fourth he is a pickle a person who gets in pickles predicaments and so often has he had to deliver up his person when peter_pan said sternly stand forth the one who did this thing that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not
slightly is the most conceited of the boy last come the twins who cannot be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one
peter_pan never quite knew what twins were and his band were not allowed to know anything he did not know so these two were always vague about themselves and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way
the boy vanish in the gloom and after a pause but not a long pause for thing go briskly on the island come the pirate on their track
we hear them before they are seen and it is always the same dreadful song avast belay yo ho heave to
a pirating we go and if we re parted by a shot we re sure to meet below a more villainous looking lot never hung in a row on execution dock
here a little in advance ever and again with his head to the ground listening his great arm bare pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments is the handsome italian cecco who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at gao
that gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mother still terrify their child on the banks of the guadjo mo
here is bill jukes every inch of him tattooed the same bill jukes who got six dozen on the walrus from flint before he would drop the bag of moidores portuguese gold pieces and cookson said to be black murphy brother but this was never proved and gentleman starkey once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his way of killing and skylights morgan skylights and the irish bo sun smee an oddly genial man who stabbed so to speak without offence and was the only non conformist in james_hook crew and noodler whose hand were fixed on backwards and robt
in the midst of them the blackest and largest in that dark setting reclined james_hook or as he wrote himself jas
mullins and alf mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the spanish main james_hook of whom it is said he was the only man that the sea cook feared
he lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his man and instead of a right hand he had the iron james_hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace
in person he was cadaverous dead looking and blackavized dark faced and his hair was dressed in long curls which at a little distance looked like black candles and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance
his eye were of the blue of the forget me not and of a profound melancholy save when he was plunging his james_hook into you at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly
in manner something of the grand seigneur still clung to him so that he even ripped you up with an air and i have been told that he was a raconteur storyteller of repute
he was never more sinister than when he was most polite which is probably the truest test of breeding and the elegance of his diction even when he was swearing no less than the distinction of his demeanour showed him one of a different cast from his crew
a man of indomitable courage it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood which was thick and of an unusual colour
in dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of charles ii having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill fated stuarts and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once
as dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them and as dogs they obeyed him but undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw
as they pass skylights lurches clumsily against him ruffling his lace collar the james_hook shoots forth there is a tearing sound and one screech then the body is kicked aside and the pirate pass on
let us now kill a pirate to show james_hook method skylights will do he has not even taken the cigars from his mouth
on the trail of the pirate stealing noiselessly down the war path which is not visible to inexperienced eye come the redskins every one of them with his eye peeled
such is the terrible man against whom peter_pan is pitted which will win they carry tomahawks and knives and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil
strung around them are scalps of boy as well as of pirate for these are the piccaninny tribe and not to be confused with the softer hearted delawares or the hurons
in the van on all fours is great big little panther a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress
she is the most beautiful of dusky dianas diana goddess of the woods and the belle of the piccaninnies coquettish flirting cold and amorous loving
by turns there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife but she staves off the altar with a hatchet
bringing up the rear the place of greatest danger comes tiger_lily proudly erect a princess in her own right observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise
the fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging but in time they will work this off
the redskins disappear as they have come like shadows and soon their place is taken by the beasts a great and motley procession lions tigers bears and the innumerable smaller savage thing that flee from them for every kind of beast and more particularly all the man eaters live cheek by jowl on the favoured island
the only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing for the moment however it constitutes their chief danger their tongues are hanging out they are hungry to night
when they have passed comes the last figure of all a gigantic crocodile we shall see for whom she is looking presently
the crocodile passes but soon the boy appear again for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace
then quickly they will be on top of each other all are keeping a sharp look out in front but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind
this shows how real the island was the first to fall out of the moving circle was the boy they flung themselves down on the sward turf close to their underground home
i do wish peter_pan would come back every one of them said nervously though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain
i am the only one who is not afraid of the pirate slightly said in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him for he added hastily but i wish he would come back and tell us whether he has heard anything more about cinderella
they talked of cinderella and tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her it was only in peter_pan absence that they could speak of mother the subject being forbidden by him as silly
all i remember about my mother nibs told them is that she often said to my father oh how i wish i had a cheque book of my own
i dont know what a cheque book is but i should just love to give my mother one while they talked they heard a distant sound
you or i not being wild thing of the woods would have heard nothing but they heard it and it was the grim song
yo ho yo ho the pirate life the flag skull and bones a merry hour a hempen rope and hey for davy jones
at once the lost boy but where are they they are no longer there rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly
with the exception of nibs who has darted away to reconnoitre look around they are already in their home under the ground a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently
for there is no entrance to be seen not so much as a large stone which if rolled away would disclose the mouth of a cave
look closely however and you may note that there are here seven large tree each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy
these are the seven entrances to the home under the ground for which james_hook has been searching in vain these many moons
as the pirate advanced the quick eye of starkey sighted nibs disappearing through the wood and at once his pistol flashed out
i will tell you where they are but how have they reached it will he find it tonight but an iron claw gripped his shoulder
captain let go he cried writhing now for the first time we hear the voice of james_hook it was a black voice
put back that pistol first it said threateningly it was one of those boy you hate i could have shot him dead
ay and the sound would have brought tiger_lily redskins upon us do you want to lose your scalp shall i after him captain asked pathetic smee and tickle him with johnny corkscrew
smee had pleasant names for everything and his cutlass was johnny corkscrew because he wiggled it in the wound one could mention many lovable traits in smee
for instance after killing it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon johnny a silent fellow he reminded james_hook
not now smee james_hook said darkly he is only one and i want to mischief all the seven scatter and look for them
james_hook heaved a heavy sigh and i know not why it was perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo sun the story of his life
he spoke long and earnestly but what it was all about smee who was rather stupid did not know in the least
the pirate disappeared among the tree and in a moment their captain and smee were alone anon later he caught the word peter_pan
most of all james_hook was saying passionately i want their captain peter_pan twas he cut off my arm
he brandished the james_hook threateningly i ve waited long to shake his hand with this oh i ll tear him
and yet said smee i have often heard you say that james_hook was worth a score of hand for combing the hair and other homely uses
ay the captain answered if i was a mother i would pray to have my child born with this instead of that and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other
then again he frowned peter_pan flung my arm he said wincing to a crocodile that happened to be passing by
i have often said smee noticed your strange dread of crocodiles not of crocodiles james_hook corrected him but of that one crocodile
it liked my arm so much smee that it has followed me ever since from sea to sea and from land to land licking its lips for the rest of me
he lowered his voice in a way said smee it sort of a compliment i want no such compliments james_hook barked petulantly
i want peter_pan who first gave the brute its taste for me he sat down on a large mushroom and now there was a quiver in his voice
smee he said huskily that crocodile would have had me before this but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it and so before it can reach me
i hear the tick and bolt he laughed but in a hollow way some day said smee the clock will run down and then he ll get you
james_hook wetted his dry lips ay he said that the fear that haunts me since sitting down he had felt curiously warm
smee he said this seat is hot he jumped up odds bobs hammer and tongs i burning
they examined the mushroom which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland they tried to pull it up and it came away at once in their hand for it had no root
stranger still smoke began at once to ascend the pirate looked at each other a chimney they both exclaimed
they had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground it was the custom of the boy to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood
not only smoke came out of it there came also child voice for so safe did the boy feel in their hiding place that they were gaily chattering
the pirate listened grimly and then replaced the mushroom they looked around them and noted the holes in the seven tree
did you hear them say peter_pan from home smee whispered fidgeting with johnny corkscrew james_hook nodded he stood for a long time lost in thought and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face
to return to the ship james_hook replied slowly through his teeth and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it
smee had been waiting for it unrip your plan captain he cried eagerly there can be but one room below for there is but one chimney
the silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece that shows they have no mother
we will leave the cake on the shore of the mermaids lagoon these boy are always swimming about there playing with the mermaids
they will find the cake and they will gobble it up because having no mother they dont know how dangerous tis to eat rich damp cake
he burst into laughter not hollow laughter now but honest laughter aha they will die smee had listened with growing admiration
it the wickedest prettiest policy ever i heard of he cried and in their exultation they danced and sang avast belay when i appear
by fear they re overtook nought left upon your bones when you have shaken claws with james_hook they began the verse but they never finished it for another sound broke in and stilled them
there was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it but as it came nearer it was more distinct
tick tick tick tick james_hook stood shuddering one foot in the air the crocodile he gasped and bounded away followed by his bo sun
it was indeed the crocodile it had passed the redskins who were now on the trail of the other pirate it oozed on after james_hook
once more the boy emerged into the open but the dangers of the night were not yet over for presently nibs rushed breathless into their midst pursued by a pack of wolves
the tongues of the pursuers were hanging out the baying of them was horrible save me save me cried nibs falling on the ground
but what can we do what can we do it was a high compliment to peter_pan that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him
what would peter_pan do they cried simultaneously almost in the same breath they cried peter_pan would look at them through his legs
it is quite the most successful way of defying wolves and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs
the next moment is the long one but victory came quickly for as the boy advanced upon them in the terrible attitude the wolves dropped their tails and fled
and then let us do what peter_pan would do now nibs rose from the ground and the others thought that his staring eye still saw the wolves
but it was not wolves he saw i have seen a wonderfuller thing he cried as they gathered round him eagerly
a great white bird it is flying this way what kind of a bird do you think i dont know nibs said awestruck but it looks so weary and as it flies it moans poor wendy
poor wendy i remember said slightly instantly there are birds called wendies see it comes cried curly pointing to wendy in the heavens
wendy was now almost overhead and they could hear her plaintive cry but more distinct came the shrill voice of tinker_bell
the jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship and was darting at her victim from every direction pinching savagely each time she touched
hullo tink cried the wondering boy tink reply rang out peter_pan wants you to shoot the wendy it was not in their nature to question when peter_pan ordered
let us do what peter_pan wishes cried the simple boy quick bows and arrows all but tootles popped down their tree
he had a bow and arrow with him and tink noted it and rubbed her little hand quick tootles quick she screamed
out of the way tink he shouted and then he fired and wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast
peter_pan will be so pleased tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow chapter the little house
foolish tootles was standing like a conqueror over wendy body when the other boy sprang armed from their tree you are too late he cried proudly i have shot the wendy
peter_pan will be so pleased with me overhead tinker_bell shouted silly ass and darted into hiding the others did not hear her
they had crowded round wendy and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood if wendy heart had been beating they would all have heard it
slightly was the first to speak this is no bird he said in a scared voice i think this must be a lady
a lady said tootles and fell a trembling and we have killed her nibs said hoarsely they all whipped off their caps
now i see curly said peter_pan was bringing her to us he threw himself sorrowfully on the ground a lady to take care of us at last said one of the twins and you have killed her
they were sorry for him but sorrier for themselves and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him
tootles face was very white but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before
i did it he said reflecting when lady used to come to me in dreams i said pretty mother pretty mother
but when at last she really came i shot her he moved slowly away dont go they called in pity
it was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth
i must he answered shaking i am so afraid of peter_pan they heard peter_pan crow peter_pan they cried for it was always thus that he signalled his return
hide her they whispered and gathered hastily around wendy but tootles stood aloof again came that ringing crow and peter_pan dropped in front of them
greetings boy he cried and mechanically they saluted and then again was silence he frowned i am back he said hotly why do you not cheer
they opened their mouth but the cheers would not come he overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings
great news boy he cried i have brought at last a mother for you all still no sound except a little thud from tootles as he dropped on his knees
have you not seen her asked peter_pan becoming troubled she flew this way ah me one voice said and another said oh mournful day
peter_pan he said quietly i will show her to you and when the others would still have hidden her he said back twins let peter_pan see
so they all stood back and let him see and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next
tootles rose she is dead he said uncomfortably perhaps she is frightened at being dead
he thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her and then never going near the spot any more
they would all have been glad to follow if he had done this but there was the arrow he took it from her heart and faced his band
whose arrow he demanded sternly mine peter_pan said tootles on his knees oh dastard hand peter_pan said and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger
tootles did not flinch he bared his breast strike peter_pan he said firmly strike true twice did peter_pan raise the arrow and twice did his hand fall
i cannot strike he said with awe there is something stays my hand all looked at him in wonder save nibs who fortunately looked at wendy
it is she he cried the wendy lady see her arm wonderful to relate tell wendy had raised her arm
nibs bent over her and listened reverently i think she said poor tootles he whispered she lives peter_pan said briefly
slightly cried instantly the wendy lady lives then peter_pan knelt beside her and found his button you remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck
see he said the arrow struck against this it is the kiss i gave her it has saved her life
i remember kisses slightly interposed quickly let me see it ay that a kiss peter_pan did not hear him he was begging wendy to get better quickly so that he could show her the mermaids
of course she could not answer yet being still in a frightful faint but from overhead came a wailing note listen to tink said curly she is crying because the wendy lives
then they had to tell peter_pan of tink crime and almost never had they seen him look so stern listen tinker_bell he cried i am your friend no more
not until wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say well not for ever but for a whole week
begone from me for ever she flew on to his shoulder and pleaded but he brushed her off do you think tinker_bell was grateful to wendy for raising her arm
oh dear no never wanted to pinch her so much fairy indeed are strange and peter_pan who understood them best often cuffed
slapped them but what to do with wendy in her present delicate state of health let us carry her down into the house curly suggested
ay said slightly that is what one does with lady no no peter_pan said you must not touch her it would not be sufficiently respectful
that said slightly is what i was thinking but if she lies there tootles said she will die ay she will die slightly admitted but there is no way out
yes there is cried peter_pan let us build a little house round her they were all delighted quick he ordered them bring me each of you the best of what we have
they skurried this way and that down for bedding up for firewood and while they were at it who should appear but john and michael
gut our house be sharp in a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding as they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing stopped woke up moved another step and slept again
john john michael would cry wake up where is nana john and mother and then john would rub his eye and mutter
it is true we did fly you may be sure they were very relieved to find peter_pan hullo peter_pan they said
he was very busy at the moment measuring wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need
hullo replied peter_pan amicably though he had quite forgotten them of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table
john michael proposed let us wake her and get her to make supper for us but as he said it some of the other boy rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house
john and michael watched him is wendy asleep they asked yes look at them he cried
curly said peter_pan in his most captainy voice see that these boy help in the building of the house
ay ay sir build a house exclaimed john for the wendy said curly for wendy john said aghast
why she is only a girl that explained curly is why we are her servants you wendy servants
yes said peter_pan and you also away with them the astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry
chairs and a fender fireplace first peter_pan ordered then we shall build a house round them ay said slightly that is how a house is built it all comes back to me
peter_pan thought of everything slightly he cried fetch a doctor ay ay said slightly at once and disappeared scratching his head
but he knew peter_pan must be obeyed and he returned in a moment wearing john hat and looking solemn please sir said peter_pan going to him are you a doctor
the difference between him and the other boy at such a time was that they knew it was make believe while to him make believe and true were exactly the same thing
this sometimes troubled them as when they had to make believe that they had had their dinners if they broke down in their make believe he rapped them on the knuckles
yes my little man slightly anxiously replied who had chapped knuckles please sir peter_pan explained a lady lies very ill
she was lying at their feet but slightly had the sense not to see her tut tut tut he said where does she lie
i will put a glass thing in her mouth said slightly and he made believe to do it while peter_pan waited
in yonder glade it was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn how is she inquired peter_pan
i will call again in the evening slightly said give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it but after he had returned the hat to john he blew big breaths which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty
in the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at wendy feet
tut tut tut said slightly this has cured her i am glad peter_pan cried if only we knew said one the kind of house she likes best
peter_pan shouted another she is moving in her sleep her mouth opens cried a third looking respectfully into it
oh lovely perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep said peter_pan wendy sing the kind of house you would like to have
i wish i had a pretty house the littlest ever seen with funny little red walls and roof of mossy green
they gurgled with joy at this for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap and all the ground was carpeted with moss
as they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves we ve built the little walls and roof and made a lovely door so tell us mother wendy what are you wanting more
to this she answered greedily oh really next i think i ll have gay window all about with roses peeping in you know and babies peeping out
immediately without opening her eye wendy began to sing with a blow of their fists they made window and large yellow leaves were the blinds
to prevent peter_pan ordering babies they hurried into song again we ve made the roses peeping out the babes are at the door we cannot make ourselves you know cos we ve been made before
but roses roses cried peter_pan sternly quickly they made believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls babies peter_pan seeing this to be a good idea at once pretended that it was his own
the house was quite beautiful and no doubt wendy was very cosy within though of course they could no longer see her
peter_pan strode up and down ordering finishing touches nothing escaped his eagle eye just when it seemed absolutely finished there no knocker on the door he said
they were very ashamed but tootles gave the sole of his shoe and it made an excellent knocker absolutely finished now they thought
not of bit of it there no chimney peter_pan said we must have a chimney it certainly does need a chimney said john importantly
this gave peter_pan an idea he snatched the hat off john head knocked out the bottom top and put the hat on the roof
the little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that as if to say thank you smoke immediately began to come out of the hat
now really and truly it was finished nothing remained to do but to knock all look your best peter_pan warned them first impressions are awfully important
he knocked politely and now the wood was as still as the child not a sound to be heard except from tinker_bell who was watching from a branch and openly sneering
he was glad no one asked him what first impressions are they were all too busy looking their best what the boy were wondering was would any one answer the knock
if a lady what would she be like the door opened and a lady came out it was wendy they all whipped off their hats
she looked properly surprised and this was just how they had hoped she would look where am i she said
of course slightly was the first to get his word in wendy lady he said rapidly for you we built this house
oh say you re pleased cried nibs lovely darling house wendy said and they were the very words they had hoped she would say
and we are your child cried the twins then all went on their knees and holding out their arm cried wendy lady be our mother
ought i wendy said all shining of course it frightfully fascinating but you see i am only a little girl
that doesnt matter said peter_pan as if he were the only person present who knew all about it though he was really the one who knew least
i have no real experience what we need is just a nice motherly person oh dear wendy said you see i feel that is exactly what i am
it is it is they all cried we saw it at once very well she said i will do my best
come inside at once you naughty child i am sure your feet are damp and before i put you to bed i have just time to finish the story of cinderella
in they went i dont know how there was room for them but you can squeeze very tight in the neverland
by and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the tree but she herself slept that night in the little house and peter_pan kept watch outside with drawn sword for the pirate could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl
the little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness with a bright light showing through its blinds and the chimney smoking beautifully and peter_pan standing on guard
after a time he fell asleep and some unsteady fairy had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy
any of the other boy obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed but they just tweaked peter_pan nose and passed on
and that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with wendy chapter the home under the ground
james_hook you remember had sneered at the boy for thinking they needed a tree apiece but this was ignorance for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down and no two of the boy were quite the same size
once you fitted you drew in let out your breath at the top and down you went at exactly the right speed while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately and so wriggled up
of course when you have mastered the action you are able to do these thing without thinking of them and nothing can be more graceful
but you simply must fit and peter_pan measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you while you have to be made to fit the tree
usually it is done quite easily as by your wearing too many garments or too few but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape peter_pan does some thing to you and after that you fit
once you fit great care must be taken to go on fitting and this as wendy was to discover to her delight keeps a whole family in perfect condition
one of the first thing peter_pan did next day was to measure wendy and john and michael for hollow tree wendy and michael fitted their tree at the first try but john had to be altered a little
after a few day practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well and how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground especially wendy
it consisted of one large room as all house should do with a floor in which you could dig for worms if you wanted to go fishing and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour which were used as stools
a never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room but every morning they sawed the trunk through level with the floor
by tea time it was always about two feet high and then they put a door on top of it the whole thus becoming a table as soon as they cleared away they sawed off the trunk again and thus there was more room to play
there was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it and across this wendy stretched strings made of fibre from which she suspended her washing
the bed was tilted against the wall by day and let down at when it filled nearly half the room and all the boy slept in it except michael lying like sardines in a tin
michael should have used it also but wendy would have desired a baby and he was the littlest and you know what women are and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket
it was rough and simple and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances
but there was one recess in the wall no larger than a bird cage which was the private apartment of tinker_bell
it could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain which tink who was most fastidious particular always kept drawn when dressing or undressing
there was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal when all turned at once no woman however large could have had a more exquisite boudoir dressing room and bed chamber combined
the couch as she always called it was a genuine queen mab with club legs and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit blossom was in season
her mirror was a puss in boots of which there are now only three unchipped known to fairy dealers the washstand was pie crust and reversible the chest of drawers an authentic charming the sixth and the carpet and rugs the best the early period of margery and robin
tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house as indeed was perhaps inevitable and her chamber though beautiful looked rather conceited having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up
i suppose it was all especially entrancing to wendy because those rampagious boy of hers gave her so much to do
there was a chandelier from tiddlywinks for the look of the thing but of course she lit the residence herself really there were whole weeks when except perhaps with a stocking in the evening she was never above ground
the cooking i can tell you kept her nose to the pot and even if there was nothing in it even if there was no pot she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same
you never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make believe it all depended upon peter_pan whim he could eat really eat if it was part of a game but he could not stodge cram down the food just to feel stodgy stuffed with food which is what most child like better than anything else the next best thing being to talk about it
of course it was trying but you simply had to follow his lead and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree
make believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder he let you stodge
then as she expressed it she had a breathing time for herself and she occupied it in making new thing for them and putting double pieces on the knees for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees
when she sat down to a basketful of their stockings every heel with a hole in it she would fling up her arm and exclaim oh dear i am sure i sometimes think spinsters are to be envied
wendy favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed her face beamed when she exclaimed this
well it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out and they just ran into each other arm
you remember about her pet wolf after that it followed her about everywhere as time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her
this is a difficult question because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the neverland where it is calculated by moons and suns and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland
but i am afraid that wendy did not really worry about her father and mother she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by and this gave her complete ease of mind
what did disturb her at time was that john remembered his parents vaguely only as people he had once known while michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother
these thing scared her a little and nobly anxious to do her duty she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it as like as possible to the one she used to do at school
the other boy thought this awfully interesting and insisted on joining and they made slates for themselves and sat round the table writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another slate and passed round
they were the most ordinary questions what was the colour of mother eye which was taller father or mother was mother blonde or brunette
a write an essay of not less than words on how i spent my last holidays or the characters of father and mother compared
answer all three questions if possible only one of these to be attempted or describe mother laugh describe father laugh
they were just everyday questions like these and when you could not answer them you were told to make a cross and it was really dreadful what a number of crosses even john made
of course the only boy who replied to every question was slightly and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first but his answers were perfectly ridiculous and he really came out last a melancholy thing
for one thing he despised all mother except wendy and for another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell not the smallest word
describe mother party dress describe the kennel and its inmate peter_pan did not compete he was above all that sort of thing
by the way the questions were all written in the past tense what was the colour of mother eye and so on
adventures of course as we shall see were of daily occurrence but about this time peter_pan invented with wendy help a new game that fascinated him enormously until he suddenly had no more interest in it which as you have been told was what always happened with his games
it consisted in pretending not to have adventures in doing the sort of thing john and michael had been doing all their lives sitting on stools flinging balls in the air pushing each other going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly
to see peter_pan doing nothing on a stool was a great sight he could not help looking solemn at such time to sit
wendy you see had been forgetting too still seemed to him such a comic thing to do he boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health
for several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him and john and michael had to pretend to be delighted also otherwise he would have treated them severely
he often went out alone and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not
he might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it and then when you went out you found the body and on the other hand he might say a great deal about it and yet you could not find the body
sometimes he came home with his head bandaged and then wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water while he told a dazzling tale
there were however many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself and there were still more that were at least partly true for the other boy were in them and said they were wholly true
to describe them all would require a book as large as an english latin latin english dictionary and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island
but she was never quite sure you know the difficulty is which one to choose should we take the brush with the redskins at slightly gulch
it was a sanguinary affair and especially interesting as showing one of peter_pan peculiarities which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides
at the gulch when victory was still in the balance sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that he called out i redskin to day what are you tootles
and so on and they were all redskins and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by peter_pan methods agreed to be lost boy for that once and so at it they all went again more fiercely than ever
the extraordinary upshot of this adventure was but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate
perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground when several of them stuck in the hollow tree and had to be pulled out like corks
and tootles answered redskin what are you nibs and nibs said redskin what are you twin or we might tell how peter_pan saved tiger_lily life in the mermaids lagoon and so made her his ally
or we could tell of that cake the pirate cooked so that the boy might eat it and perish and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another but always wendy snatched it from the hand of her child so that in time it lost its succulence and became as hard as a stone and was used as a missile and james_hook fell over it in the dark
or suppose we tell of the birds that were peter_pan friends particularly of the never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon and how the nest fell into the water and still the bird sat on her eggs and peter_pan gave orders that she was not to be disturbed
that is a pretty story and the end shows how grateful a bird can be but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one
a shorter adventure and quite as exciting was tinker_bell attempt with the help of some street fairy to have the sleeping wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland
or again we might choose peter_pan defiance of the lions when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it and though he waited for hours with the other boy and wendy looking on breathlessly from tree not one of them dared to accept his challenge
fortunately the leaf gave way and wendy woke thinking it was bath time and swam back which of these adventures shall we choose
the best way will be to toss for it i have tossed and the lagoon has won this almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or tink leaf had won
of course i could do it again and make it best out of three however perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon
if you shut your eye and are a lucky one you may see at time a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness then if you squeeze your eye tighter the pool begins to take shape and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire
this is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland just one heavenly moment if there could be two moment you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing
the child often spent long summer day on this lagoon swimming or floating most of the time playing the mermaid games in the water and so forth
you must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them on the contrary it was among wendy lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them
when she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score especially on marooners rock where they loved to bask combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her or she might even swim on tiptoe as it were to within a yard of them but then they saw her and dived probably splashing her with their tails not by accident but intentionally
they treated all the boy in the same way except of course peter_pan who chatted with them on marooners rock by the hour and sat on their tails when they got cheeky
chapter the mermaids lagoon but just before they go on fire you see the lagoon he gave wendy one of their combs
the most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon when they utter strange wailing cries but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then and until the evening of which we have now to tell wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight less from fear for of course peter_pan would have accompanied her than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven
she was often at the lagoon however on sunny day after rain when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles
the bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst
sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time and it is quite a pretty sight
the goals are at each end of the rainbow and the keepers only are allowed to use their hand but the moment the child tried to join in they had to play by themselves for the mermaids immediately disappeared
nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers and were not above taking an idea from them for john introduced a new way of hitting the bubble with the head instead of the hand and the mermaids adopted it
it must also have been rather pretty to see the child resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid day meal
this is the one mark that john has left on the neverland wendy insisted on their doing this and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make believe
so they lay there in the sun and their bodies glistened in it while she sat beside them and looked important
the rock was not much larger than their great bed but of course they all knew how not to take up much room and they were dozing or at least lying with their eye shut and pinching occasionally when they thought wendy was not looking
it was one such day and they were all on marooners rock she was very busy stitching while she stitched a change came to the lagoon
wendy could no longer see to thread her needle and when she looked up the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly
little shivers ran over it and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water turning it cold it was not she knew that night had come but something as dark as night had come
no worse than that it had not come but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming
there crowded upon her all the story she had been told of marooners rock so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown
of course she should have roused the child at once not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly
what was it they drown when the tide rises for then it is submerged but she was a young mother and she did not know this
she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid day meal so though fear was upon her and she longed to hear male voice she would not waken them
even when she heard the sound of muffled oars though her heart was in her mouth she did not waken them
it was well for those boy then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep
she stood over them to let them have their sleep out was it not brave of wendy peter_pan sprang erect as wide awake at once as a dog and with one warning cry he roused the others
he stood motionless one hand to his ear pirate he cried the others came closer to him a strange smile was playing about his face and wendy saw it and shuddered
while that smile was on his face no one dared address him all they could do was to stand ready to obey
the order came sharp and incisive dive there was a gleam of legs and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted marooners rock stood alone in the forbidding water as if it were itself marooned
it was the pirate dinghy with three figures in her smee and starkey and the third a captive no other than tiger_lily
she was to be left on the rock to perish an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy hunting ground
yet her face was impassive she was the daughter of a chief she must die as a chief daughter it is enough
the boat drew nearer her hand and ankles were tied and she knew what was to be her fate they had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth
no watch was kept on the ship it being james_hook boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around
now her fate would help to guard it also one more wail would go the round in that wind by night
in the gloom that they brought with them the two pirate did not see the rock till they crashed into it
now then what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leave her here to drown
it was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock she was too proud to offer a vain resistance
luff you lubber cried an irish voice that was smee here the rock quite near the rock but out of sight two heads were bobbing up and down peter_pan and wendy
wendy was crying for it was the first tragedy she had seen peter_pan had seen many tragedies but he had forgotten them all
he was less sorry than wendy for tiger_lily it was two against one that angered him and he meant to save her
an easy way would have been to wait until the pirate had gone but he was never one to choose the easy way
there was almost nothing he could not do and he now imitated the voice of james_hook ahoy there you lubbers
he called it was a marvellous imitation the captain said the pirate staring at each other in surprise
he must be swimming out to us starkey said when they had looked for him in vain we are putting the redskin on the rock smee called out
set her free came the astonishing answer free yes cut her bonds and let her go but captain at once ye hear cried peter_pan or i ll plunge my james_hook in you
this is queer smee gasped better do what the captain orders said starkey nervously ay ay smee said and he cut tiger_lily cords
of course wendy was very elated over peter_pan cleverness but she knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth
at once like an eel she slid between starkey legs into the water but it was stayed even in the act for boat ahoy
rang over the lagoon in james_hook voice and this time it was not peter_pan who had spoken peter_pan may have been about to crow but his face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead
he was swimming to the boat and as his man showed a light to guide him he had soon reached them
in the light of the lantern wendy saw his james_hook grip the boat side she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from the water and quaking she would have liked to swim away but peter_pan would not budge
boat ahoy again came the voice now wendy understood the real james_hook was also in the water he was tingling with life and also top heavy with conceit
he whispered to her and though she thought so also she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself
the two pirate were very curious to know what had brought their captain to them but he sat with his head on his james_hook in a position of profound melancholy
am i not a wonder oh i am a wonder he signed to her to listen captain is all well
they asked timidly but he answered with a hollow moan he sighs said smee he sighs again said starkey
and yet a third time he sighs said smee then at last he spoke passionately the game up he cried those boy have found a mother
affrighted though she was wendy swelled with pride evil day cried starkey what a mother asked the ignorant smee
he doesnt know and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate smee would be her one
wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed peter_pan pulled her beneath the water for james_hook had started up crying what was that
i heard nothing said starkey raising the lantern over the water and as the pirate looked they saw a strange sight
it was the nest i have told you of floating on the lagoon and the never bird was sitting on it
see said james_hook in answer to smee question that is a mother what a lesson the nest must have fallen into the water but would the mother desert her eggs
there was a break in his voice as if for a moment he recalled innocent day when but he brushed away this weakness with his james_hook
smee much impressed gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past but the more suspicious starkey said if she is a mother perhaps she is hanging about here to help peter_pan
no james_hook winced ay he said that is the fear that haunts me he was roused from this dejection by smee eager voice
captain said smee could we not kidnap these boy mother and make her our mother it is a princely scheme cried james_hook and at once it took practical shape in his great brain
we will seize the child and carry them to the boat the boy we will make walk the plank and wendy shall be our mother
again wendy forgot herself never she cried and bobbed what was that but they could see nothing
they thought it must have been a leaf in the wind do you agree my bullies asked james_hook
there is my hand on it they both said and there is my james_hook swear they all swore by this time they were on the rock and suddenly james_hook remembered tiger_lily
where is the redskin he demanded abruptly he had a playful humour at moment and they thought this was one of the moment
that is all right captain smee answered complacently we let her go let her go cried james_hook twas your own orders the bo sun faltered
you called over the water to us to let her go said starkey brimstone and gall thundered james_hook what cozening cheating is going on here
his face had gone black with rage but he saw that they believed their words and he was startled
lads he said shaking a little i gave no such order it is passing queer smee said and they all fidgeted uncomfortably
james_hook raised his voice but there was a quiver in it spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to night he cried dost hear me
of course peter_pan should have kept quiet but of course he did not he immediately answered in james_hook voice odds bobs hammer and tongs i hear you
in that supreme moment james_hook did not blanch even at the gills but smee and starkey clung to each other in terror
who are you stranger speak james_hook demanded i am james_hook replied the voice captain of the jolly roger
you are not you are not james_hook cried hoarsely brimstone and gall the voice retorted say that again and i ll cast anchor in you
james_hook tried a more ingratiating manner if you are james_hook he said almost humbly come tell me who am i
a codfish replied the voice only a codfish a codfish james_hook echoed blankly and it was then but not till then that his proud spirit broke
he saw his man draw back from him have we been captained all this time by a codfish they muttered
it is lowering to our pride they were his dogs snapping at him but tragic figure though he had become he scarcely heeded them
against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him that he needed it was his own he felt his ego slipping from him
in his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine as in all the great pirate and it sometimes gave him intuitions
dont desert me bully he whispered hoarsely to it suddenly he tried the guessing game james_hook he called have you another voice
now peter_pan could never resist a game and he answered blithely in his own voice i have and another name
ay ay vegetable asked james_hook no mineral no animal yes man no this answer rang out scornfully
boy yes ordinary boy no wonderful boy to wendy pain the answer that rang out this time was yes
are you in england no are you here yes james_hook was completely puzzled you ask him some questions he said to the others wiping his damp brow
smee reflected i cant think of a thing he said regretfully cant guess cant guess crowed peter_pan do you give it up
of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far and the miscreants villains saw their chance
yes yes they answered eagerly well then he cried i am peter_pan peter_pan in a moment james_hook was himself again and smee and starkey were his faithful henchmen
now we have him james_hook shouted into the water smee starkey mind the boat take him dead or alive
he leaped as he spoke and simultaneously came the gay voice of peter_pan are you ready boy ay ay from various parts of the lagoon
then lam into the pirate the fight was short and sharp first to draw blood was john who gallantly climbed into the boat and held starkey
there was fierce struggle in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate grasp he wriggled overboard and john leapt after him
here and there a head bobbed up in the water and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop
the dinghy drifted away in the confusion some struck at their own side the corkscrew of smee got tootles in the fourth rib but he was himself pinked nicked in turn by curly
farther from the rock starkey was pressing slightly and the twins hard where all this time was peter_pan he was seeking bigger game
the others were all brave boy and they must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain his iron claw made a circle of dead water round him from which they fled like affrighted fishes
but there was one who did not fear him there was one prepared to enter that circle strangely it was not in the water that they met
james_hook rose to the rock to breathe and at the same moment peter_pan scaled it on the opposite side the rock was slippery as a ball and they had to crawl rather than climb
each feeling for a grip met the other arm in surprise they raised their heads their face were almost touching so they met
some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to began combat they had a sinking feeling in the stomach
neither knew that the other was coming had it been so with peter_pan at that moment i would admit it after all he was the only man that the sea cook had feared
quick as thought he snatched a knife from james_hook belt and was about to drive it home when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe
but peter_pan had no sinking he had one feeling only gladness and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy it would not have been fighting fair
he gave the pirate a hand to help him up it was then that james_hook bit him not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed peter_pan
it made him quite helpless he could only stare horrified every child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly
after you have been unfair to him he will love you again but will never afterwards be quite the same boy
all he thinks he has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness no one ever gets over the first unfairness no one except peter_pan
he often met it but he always forgot it i suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest
so when he met it now it was like the first time and he could just stare helpless twice the iron hand clawed him
a few moment afterwards the other boy saw james_hook in the water striking wildly for the ship no elation on the pestilent face now only white fear for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him
on ordinary occasions the boy would have swum alongside cheering but now they were uneasy for they had lost both peter_pan and wendy and were scouring the lagoon for them calling them by name
they found the dinghy and went home in it shouting peter_pan wendy as they went but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids
they must be swimming back or flying the boy concluded they were not very anxious because they had such faith in peter_pan
they chuckled boylike because they would be late for bed and it was all mother wendy fault when their voice died away there came cold silence over the lagoon and then a feeble cry
help help two small figures were beating against the rock the girl had fainted and lay on the boy arm
with a last effort peter_pan pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising
as they lay side by side a mermaid caught wendy by the feet and began pulling her softly into the water
he knew that they would soon be drowned but he could do no more peter_pan feeling her slip from him woke with a start and was just in time to draw her back
but he had to tell her the truth we are on the rock wendy he said but it is growing smaller
soon the water will be over it she did not understand even now we must go she said almost brightly
yes he answered faintly shall we swim or fly peter_pan he had to tell her do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island wendy without my help
she had to admit that she was too tired he moaned what is it she asked anxious about him at once
i cant help you wendy james_hook wounded me i can neither fly nor swim do you mean we shall both be drowned
look how the water is rising they put their hand over their eye to shut out the sight they thought they would soon be no more
as they sat thus something brushed against peter_pan as light as a kiss and stayed there as if saying timidly can i be of any use
it was the tail of a kite which michael had made some day before it had torn itself out of his hand and floated away
michael kite peter_pan said without interest but next moment he had seized the tail and was pulling the kite toward him
it lifted michael off the ground he cried why should it not carry you both of us it cant lift two michael and curly tried
let us draw lots wendy said bravely and you a lady never already he had tied the tail round her
she clung to him she refused to go without him but with a good bye wendy he pushed her from the rock and in a few minutes she was borne out of his sight
pale rays of light tiptoed across the water and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world
peter_pan was alone on the lagoon the rock was very small now soon it would be submerged the mermaids calling to the moon
a tremour ran through him like a shudder passing over the sea but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them and peter_pan felt just the one
next moment he was standing erect on the rock again with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him
peter_pan was not quite like other boy but he was afraid at last it was saying to die will be an awfully big adventure
the last sound peter_pan heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea
he was too far away to hear their doors shut but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes as in all the nicest house on the mainland and he heard the bells
steadily the water rose till they were nibbling at his feet and to pass the time until they made their final gulp he watched the only thing on the lagoon
he thought it was a piece of floating paper perhaps part of the kite and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore
presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose for it was fighting the tide and sometimes winning and when it won peter_pan always sympathetic to the weaker side could not help clapping it was such a gallant piece of paper
it was not really a piece of paper it was the never bird making desperate efforts to reach peter_pan on the nest
by working her wings in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft but by the time peter_pan recognised her
chapter the never bird she was very exhausted she had come to save him to give him her nest though there were eggs in it
i can suppose only that like mrs_darling and the rest of them she was melted because he had all his first teeth
she called out to him what she had come for and he called out to her what she was doing there but of course neither of them understood the other language
in fanciful story people can talk to the birds freely and i wish for the moment i could pretend that this were such a story and say that peter_pan replied intelligently to the never bird but truth is best and i want to tell you only what really happened
i rather wonder at the bird for though he had been nice to her he had also sometimes tormented her well not only could they not understand each other but they forgot their manners
i want you to get into the nest the bird called speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible and then you can drift ashore but i am too tired to bring it any nearer so you must try to swim to it what are you quacking about
peter_pan answered why dont you let the nest drift as usual i want you the bird said and repeated it all over
then peter_pan tried slow and distinct what are you quacking about and so on the never bird became irritated they have very short tempers
you dunderheaded little jay she screamed why dont you do as i tell you peter_pan felt that she was calling him names and at a venture he retorted hotly
nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock
so are you then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark shut up shut up then up she flew deserting her eggs so as to make her meaning clear
it was not to receive his thanks however that she hung there in the sky it was not even to watch him get into the nest it was to see what he did with her eggs
then at last he understood and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead there were two large white eggs and peter_pan lifted them up and reflected
the bird covered her face with her wings so as not to see the last of them but she could not help peeping between the feathers
i forget whether i have told you that there was a stave on the rock driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure
the child had discovered the glittering hoard and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores diamonds pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls who pounced upon them for food and then flew away raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them
the stave was still there and on it starkey had hung his hat a deep tarpaulin watertight with a broad brim
the never bird saw at once what he was up to and screamed her admiration of him and alas peter_pan crowed his agreement with her
then he got into the nest reared the stave in it as a mast and hung up his shirt for a sail
peter_pan put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon it floated beautifully at the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs
of course when peter_pan landed he beached his barque small ship actually the never bird nest in this particular case in point in a place where the bird would easily find it but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest
it drifted about till it went to pieces and often starkey came to the shore of the lagoon and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat
as we shall not see her again it may be worth mentioning here that all never birds now build in that shape of nest with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing
great were the rejoicings when peter_pan reached the home under the ground almost as soon as wendy who had been carried hither and thither by the kite
every boy had adventures to tell but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed
this so inflated them that they did various dodgy thing to get staying up still longer such as demanding bandages but wendy though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound was scandalised by the lateness of the hour and cried to bed to bed in a voice that had to be obeyed
next day however she was awfully tender and gave out bandages to every one and they played till bed time at limping about and carrying their arm in slings
chapter the happy home one important result of the brush with the pirate on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends
peter_pan had saved tiger_lily from a dreadful fate and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him
all night they sat above keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirate which obviously could not be much longer delayed
even by day they hung about smoking the pipe of peace and looking almost as if they wanted tit bits to eat
they called peter_pan the great white father prostrating themselves lying down before him and he liked this tremendously so that it was not really good for him
the great white father he would say to them in a very lordly manner as they grovelled at his feet is glad to see the piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam from the pirate
she drifted in one direction and he was borne off in another both cheering me tiger_lily that lovely creature would reply
she was far too pretty to cringe in this way but peter_pan thought it his due and he would answer condescendingly it is good
peter_pan save me me his velly nice friend me no let pirate hurt him peter_pan has spoken
always when he said peter_pan has spoken it meant that they must now shut up and they accepted it humbly in that spirit but they were by no means so respectful to the other boy whom they looked upon as just ordinary braves
they said how do to them and thing like that and what annoyed the boy was that peter_pan seemed to think this all right
secretly wendy sympathised with them a little but she was far too loyal a housewife to listen to any complaints against father
father knows best she always said whatever her private opinion must be her private opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw
we have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the night of night because of its adventures and their upshot
the day as if quietly gathering its forces had been almost uneventful and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above while below the child were having their evening meal all except peter_pan who had gone out to get the time
the way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile and then stay near him till the clock struck
the meal happened to be a make believe tea and they sat around the board guzzling in their greed and really what with their chatter and recriminations the noise as wendy said was positively deafening
to be sure she did not mind noise but she simply would not have them grabbing thing and then excusing themselves by saying that tootles had pushed their elbow
there was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals but should refer the matter of dispute to wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying i complain of so and so but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much
silence cried wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them that they were not all to speak at once
is your mug empty slightly darling not quite empty mummy slightly said after looking into an imaginary mug he hasnt even begun to drink his milk nibs interposed
this was telling and slightly seized his chance i complain of nibs he cried promptly john however had held up his hand first
well john may i sit in peter_pan chair as he is not here sit in father chair john wendy was scandalised
certainly not he is not really our father john answered he didnt even know how a father does till i showed him
he was so much the humblest of them indeed he was the only humble one that wendy was specially gentle with him
this was grumbling we complain of john cried the twins tootles held up his hand i dont suppose tootles said diffidently bashfully or timidly that i could be father
no tootles once tootles began which was not very often he had a silly way of going on
as i cant be father he said heavily i dont suppose michael you would let me be baby no i wont michael rapped out
as i cant be baby tootles said getting heavier and heavier and heavier do you think i could be a twin
he was already in his basket no indeed replied the twins it awfully difficult to be a twin
as i cant be anything important said tootles would any of you like to see me do a trick no they all replied
then at last he stopped i hadnt really any hope he said the hateful telling broke out again slightly is coughing on the table
the twins began with cheese cakes curly is taking both butter and honey nibs is speaking with his mouth full
i complain of the twins i complain of curly i complain of nibs oh dear oh dear cried wendy i sure i sometimes think that spinsters are to be envied
she told them to clear away and sat down to her work basket a heavy load of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual
wendy remonstrated scolded michael i too big for a cradle i must have somebody in a cradle she said almost tartly and you are the littlest
while she sewed they played around her such a group of happy face and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire
it had become a very familiar scene this in the home under the ground but we are looking on it for the last time
a cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a house there was a step above and wendy you may be sure was the first to recognize it
child i hear your father step he likes you to meet him at the door above the redskins crouched before peter_pan
watch well braves i have spoken and then as so often before the gay child dragged him from his tree
as so often before but never again he had brought nuts for the boy as well as the correct time for wendy
peter_pan you just spoil them you know wendy simpered exaggerated a smile ah old lady said peter_pan hanging up his gun
it was me told him mother are called old lady michael whispered to curly i complain of michael said curly instantly
the first twin came to peter_pan father we want to dance dance away my little man said peter_pan who was in high good humour
but we want you to dance peter_pan was really the best dancer among them but he pretended to be scandalised
me my old bones would rattle and mummy too what cried wendy the mother of such an armful dance
it was not really saturday night at least it may have been for they had long lost count of the day but always if they wanted to do anything special they said this was saturday night and then they did it
but on a saturday night slightly insinuated of course it is saturday night peter_pan wendy said relenting people of our figure wendy
but it is only among our own progeny child true true so they were told they could dance but they must put on their nighties first
ah old lady peter_pan said aside to wendy warming himself by the fire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little one near by
it is sweet peter_pan isnt it wendy said frightfully gratified peter_pan i think curly has your nose
dear peter_pan she said with such a large family of course i have now passed my best but you dont want to
michael takes after you she went to him and put her hand on his shoulder ex change me do you
certainly he did not want a change but he looked at her uncomfortably blinking you know like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep
no wendy peter_pan what is it i was just thinking he said a little scared it is only make believe isnt it that i am their father
oh yes wendy said primly formally and properly you see he continued apologetically it would make me seem so old to be their real father
but they are ours peter_pan yours and mine but not really wendy he asked anxiously not if you dont wish it she replied and she distinctly heard his sigh of relief
peter_pan she asked trying to speak firmly what are your exact feelings to about me those of a devoted son wendy
i thought so she said and went and sat by herself at the extreme end of the room you are so queer he said frankly puzzled and tiger_lily is just the same
there is something she wants to be to me but she says it is not my mother no indeed it is not wendy replied with frightful emphasis
now we know why she was prejudiced against the redskins then what is it it isnt for a lady to tell
oh very well peter_pan said a little nettled perhaps tinker_bell will tell me oh yes tinker_bell will tell you wendy retorted scornfully
she is an abandoned little creature here tink who was in her bedroom eavesdropping squeaked out something impudent
she says she glories in being abandoned peter_pan interpreted he had a sudden idea perhaps tink wants to be my mother
you silly ass cried tinker_bell in a passion she had said it so often that wendy needed no translation
i almost agree with her wendy snapped fancy wendy snapping but she had been much tried and she little knew what was to happen before the night was out
their ignorance gave them one more glad hour and as it was to be their last hour on the island let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it
if she had known she would not have snapped none of them knew perhaps it was best not to know they sang and danced in their night gowns
such a deliciously creepy song it was in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them from whom they would shrink in real fear
it was a pillow fight rather than a dance and when it was finished the pillows insisted on one bout more like partners who know that they may never meet again
so uproariously gay was the dance and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it the story they told before it was time for wendy good night story
even slightly tried to tell a story that night but the beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but himself and he said happily yes it is a dull beginning
and then at last they all got into bed for wendy story the story they loved best the story peter_pan hated
usually when she began to tell this story he left the room or put his hand over his ears and possibly if he had done either of those thing this time they might all still be on the island
i say let us pretend that it is the end but to night he remained on his stool and we shall see what happened
chapter wendy story listen then said wendy settling down to her story with michael at her feet and seven boy in the bed
there was once a gentleman i had rather he had been a lady curly said i wish he had been a white rat said nibs
quiet their mother admonished cautioned them there was a lady also and oh mummy cried the first twin
you mean that there is a lady also dont you she is not dead is she oh no i am awfully glad she isnt dead said tootles
are you glad john of course i am are you glad nibs rather are you glad twins we are glad
little less noise there peter_pan called out determined that she should have fair play however beastly a story it might be in his opinion
oh dear sighed wendy the gentleman name wendy continued was mr_darling and her name was mrs_darling
i knew them john said to annoy the others i think i knew them said michael rather doubtfully
they were married you know explained wendy and what do you think they had white rats cried nibs inspired
no it awfully puzzling said tootles who knew the story by heart quiet tootles they had three descendants
what is descendants well you are one twin did you hear that john i am a descendant descendants are only child said john
now these three child had a faithful nurse called nana but mr_darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard and so all the child flew away
oh dear oh dear sighed wendy it an awfully good story said nibs they flew away wendy continued to the neverland where the lost child are
i just thought they did curly broke in excitedly i dont know how it is but i just thought they did
wendy cried tootles was one of the lost child called tootles yes he was i am in a story
hurrah i am in a story nibs hush now i want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents with all their child flown away
oo they all moaned though they were not really considering the feelings of the unhappy parents one jot
think of the empty bed oo it awfully sad the first twin said cheerfully i dont see how it can have a happy ending said the second twin
do you nibs i frightfully anxious if you knew how great is a mother love wendy told them triumphantly you would have no fear
she had now come to the part that peter_pan hated i do like a mother love said tootles hitting nibs with a pillow
you see wendy said complacently our heroine knew that the mother would always leave the window open for her child to fly back by so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time
do you like a mother love nibs i do just said nibs hitting back did they ever go back
let us now said wendy bracing herself up for her finest effort take a peep into the future and they all gave themselves the twist that makes peeps into the future easier
years have rolled by and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at london station wendy who is she
cried nibs every bit as excited as if he didnt know can it be yes no it is the fair wendy oh
and who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her now grown to man estate can they be john and michael
they are oh see dear brothers says wendy pointing upwards there is the window still standing open ah now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a mother love
so up they flew to their mummy and daddy and pen cannot describe the happy scene over which we draw a veil
that was the story and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator herself everything just as it should be you see
off we skip like the most heartless thing in the world which is what child are but so attractive and we have an entirely selfish time and then when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it confident that we shall be rewarded instead of smacked
so great indeed was their faith in a mother love that they felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer
but there was one there who knew better and when wendy finished he uttered a hollow groan what is it peter_pan
she cried running to him thinking he was ill she felt him solicitously lower down than his chest where is it peter_pan
it isnt that kind of pain peter_pan replied darkly then what kind is it wendy you are wrong about mother
they all gathered round him in affright so alarming was his agitation and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed
long ago he said i thought like you that my mother would always keep the window open for me so i stayed away for moons and moons and moons and then flew back but the window was barred for mother had forgotten all about me and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed
i am not sure that this was true but peter_pan thought it was true and it scared them
still it is best to be careful and no one knows so quickly as a child when he should give in
are you sure mother are like that yes so this was the truth about mother the toads wendy let us let go home cried john and michael together
they knew in what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother and that it is only the mother who think you cant
at once wendy replied resolutely for the horrible thought had come to her perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time
this dread made her forgetful of what must be peter_pan feelings and she said to him rather sharply peter_pan will you make the necessary arrangements
yes she said clutching them not to night asked the lost boy bewildered if you wish it he replied as coolly as if she had asked him to pass the nuts
not so much as a sorry to lose you between them if she did not mind the parting he was going to show her was peter_pan that neither did he
but of course he cared very much and he was so full of wrath against grown ups who as usual were spoiling everything that as soon as he got inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of about five to a second
he did this because there is a saying in the neverland that every time you breathe a grown up dies and peter_pan was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible
then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to the home where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence
panic stricken at the thought of losing wendy the lost boy had advanced upon her threateningly it will be worse than before she came they cried
we shant let her go let keep her prisoner ay chain her up in her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn
tootles she cried i appeal to you was it not strange she appealed to tootles quite the silliest one
grandly however did tootles respond for that one moment he dropped his silliness and spoke with dignity i am just tootles he said and nobody minds me
but the first who does not behave to wendy like an english gentleman i will blood him severely he drew back his hanger and for that instant his sun was at noon
the others held back uneasily then peter_pan returned and they saw at once that they would get no support from him
wendy he said striding up and down i have asked the redskins to guide you through the wood as flying tires you so
then he continued in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be obeyed tinker_bell will take you across the sea
nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer though tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time
he would keep no girl in the neverland against her will thank you peter_pan wake her nibs who are you
how dare you go away she cried you are to get up tink nibs called and take wendy on a journey
of course tink had been delighted to hear that wendy was going but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier and she said so in still more offensive language
then she pretended to be asleep again she says she wont nibs exclaimed aghast at such insubordination whereupon peter_pan went sternly toward the young lady chamber
tink he rapped out if you dont get up and dress at once i will open the curtains and then we shall all see you in your negligee nightgown
this made her leap to the floor who said i wasnt getting up she cried in the meantime the boy were gazing very forlornly at wendy now equipped with john and michael for the journey
by this time they were dejected not merely because they were about to lose her but also because they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they had not been invited
dear one she said if you will all come with me i feel almost sure i can get my father and mother to adopt you
the invitation was meant specially for peter_pan but each of the boy was thinking exclusively of himself and at once they jumped with joy
novelty was beckoning to them as usual crediting them with a nobler feeling wendy melted but wont they think us rather a handful
oh no said wendy rapidly thinking it out it will only mean having a few bed in the drawing room they can be hidden behind the screens on first thursdays
nibs asked in the middle of his jump peter_pan can we go they all cried imploringly they took it for granted that if they went he would go also but really they scarcely cared
thus child are ever ready when novelty knocks to desert their dearest one all right peter_pan replied with a bitter smile and immediately they rushed to get their thing
and now peter_pan wendy said thinking she had put everything right i am going to give you your medicine before you go
of course it was only water but it was out of a bottle and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops which gave it a certain medicinal quality
on this occasion however she did not give peter_pan his draught portion for just as she had prepared it she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink
she loved to give them medicine and undoubtedly gave them too much get your thing peter_pan she cried shaking
to show that her departure would leave him unmoved he skipped up and down the room playing gaily on his heartless pipes
no he answered pretending indifference i am not going with you wendy yes peter_pan no she had to run about after him though it was rather undignified
to find your mother she coaxed now if peter_pan had ever quite had a mother he no longer missed her
no no he told wendy decisively perhaps she would say i was old and i just want always to be a little boy and to have fun
he could do very well without one he had thought them out and remembered only their bad points but peter_pan
no and so the others had to be told peter_pan isnt coming peter_pan not coming they gazed blankly at him their sticks over their backs and on each stick a bundle
their first thought was that if peter_pan was not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go but he was far too proud for that
if you find your mother he said darkly i hope you will like them the awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression and most of them began to look rather doubtful
now then cried peter_pan no fuss no blubbering good bye wendy and he held out his hand cheerily quite as if they must really go now for he had something important to do
after all their face said were they not noodles to want to go she had to take his hand and there was no indication that he would prefer a thimble
you will remember about changing your flannels peter_pan she said lingering over him she was always so particular about their flannels
yes and you will take your medicine yes that seemed to be everything and an awkward pause followed
peter_pan however was not the kind that breaks down before other people are you ready tinker_bell he called out
tink darted up the nearest tree but no one followed her for it was at this moment that the pirate made their dreadful attack upon the redskins
ay ay then lead the way above where all had been so still the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel
below there was dead silence mouth opened and remained open wendy fell on her knees but her arm were extended toward peter_pan
all arm were extended to him as if suddenly blown in his direction they were beseeching him mutely not to desert them
as for peter_pan he seized his sword the same he thought he had slain barbecue with and the lust of battle was in his eye
the pirate attack had been a complete surprise a sure proof that the unscrupulous james_hook had conducted it improperly for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man
by all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who attacks and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb
the white man have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground at the foot of which a stream runs for it is destruction to be too far from water
there they await the onslaught the inexperienced one clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs but the old hand sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn
chapter the child are carried off through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle snake like among the grass without stirring a blade
not a sound is to be heard save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote
the cry is answered by other braves and some of them do it even better than the coyotes who are not very good at it
so the chill hours wear on and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first time but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching
that this was the usual procedure was so well known to james_hook that in disregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance
the piccaninnies on their part trusted implicitly to his honour and their whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his
the brushwood closes behind them as silently as sand into which a mole has dived they left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe
with that alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of civilised peoples they knew that the pirate were on the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick and in an incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began
every foot of ground between the spot where james_hook had landed his forces and the home under the tree was stealthily examined by braves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front
they found only one hillock with a stream at its base so that james_hook had no choice here he must establish himself and wait for just before the dawn
everything being thus mapped out with almost diabolical cunning the main body of the redskins folded their blankets around them and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them the pearl of manhood squatted above the child home awaiting the cold moment when they should deal pale death
here dreaming though wide awake of the exquisite tortures to which they were to put him at break of day those confiding savages were found by the treacherous james_hook
from the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts as escaped the carnage he does not seem even to have paused at the rising ground though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it
no thought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited his subtle mind he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent on he pounded with no policy but to fall to get into combat
what could the bewildered scouts do masters as they were of every war like artifice save this one but trot helplessly after him exposing themselves fatally to view while they gave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry
around the brave tiger_lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors and they suddenly saw the perfidious pirate bearing down upon them
fell from their eye then the film through which they had looked at victory no more would they torture at the stake
for them the happy hunting grounds was now they knew it but as their father sons they acquitted themselves even then they had time to gather in a phalanx dense formation that would have been hard to break
had they risen quickly but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race it is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of the white
thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirate must have been to them they remained stationary for a moment not a muscle moving as if the foe had come by invitation
then indeed the tradition gallantly upheld they seized their weapons and the air was torn with the war cry but it was now too late
it is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight thus perished many of the flower of the piccaninny tribe
did they die for with lean wolf fell alf mason to disturb the spanish main no more and among others who bit the dust were geo
turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible panther who ultimately cut a way through the pirate with tiger_lily and a small remnant of the tribe
not all unavenged scourie chas turley and the alsatian foggerty to what extent james_hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide
had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he and his man would probably have been butchered and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account
on the other hand this as destroying the element of surprise would have made his strategy of no avail so that the whole question is beset with difficulties
one cannot at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme and the fell deadly genius with which it was carried out
what he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method what were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment
fain gladly would his dogs have known as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses they gathered at a discreet distance from his james_hook and squinted through their ferret eye at this extraordinary man
elation must have been in his heart but his face did not reflect it ever a dark and solitary enigma he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance
the night work was not yet over for it was not the redskins he had come out to destroy they were but the bees to be smoked so that he should get at the honey
it was peter_pan he wanted peter_pan and wendy and their band but chiefly peter_pan peter_pan was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man hatred of him
true he had flung james_hook arm to the crocodile but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led owing to the crocodile pertinacity persistance hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant
the truth is that there was a something about peter_pan which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy it was not his courage it was not his engaging appearance it was not
there is no beating about the bush for we know quite well what it was and have got to tell it was peter_pan cockiness
this had got on james_hook nerves it made his iron claw twitch and at night it disturbed him like an insect
while peter_pan lived the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come
the question now was how to get down the tree or how to get his dogs down he ran his greedy eye over them searching for the thinnest one
they wriggled uncomfortably for they knew he would not scruple hesitate to ram them down with poles in the meantime what of the boy
we have seen them at the first clang of the weapons turned as it were into stone figures open mouthed all appealing with outstretched arm to peter_pan and we return to them as their mouth close and their arm fall to their sides
the pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose passed like a fierce gust of wind but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate
the pirate listening avidly at the mouth of the tree heard the question put by every boy and alas they also heard peter_pan answer
which side had won if the redskins have won he said they will beat the tom tom it is always their sign of victory
you will never hear the tom tom again he muttered but inaudibly of course for strict silence had been enjoined urged to his amazement
james_hook signed him to beat the tom tom and slowly there came to smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order
now smee had found the tom tom and was at that moment sitting on it never probably had this simple man admired james_hook so much
twice smee beat upon the instrument and then stopped to listen gleefully the tom tom the miscreants heard peter_pan cry an indian victory
the doomed child answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above and almost immediately they repeated their good byes to peter_pan
this puzzled the pirate but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the tree
rapidly and silently james_hook gave his orders one man to each tree and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart
they smirked at each other and rubbed their hand chapter do you believe in fairy the more quickly this horror is disposed of the better
he rose out of it into the arm of cecco who flung him to smee who flung him to starkey who flung him to bill jukes who flung him to noodler and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate
all the boy were plucked from their tree in this ruthless manner and several of them were in the air at a time like bales of goods flung from hand to hand
with ironical politeness james_hook raised his hat to her and offering her his arm escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged
the first to emerge from his tree was curly a different treatment was accorded to wendy who came last he did it with such an air he was so frightfully distingue
perhaps it is tell tale to divulge that for a moment james_hook entranced her and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results
had she haughtily unhanded him and we should have loved to write it of her she would have been hurled through the air like the others and then james_hook would probably not have been present at the tying of the child and had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered slightly secret and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul attempt on peter_pan life
they were tied to prevent their flying away doubled up with their knees close to their ears and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces
imposingly distinguished that she was too fascinated to cry out she was only a little girl all went well until slightly turn came
when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in going round and leave no tags ends with which to tie a knot
the pirate kicked him in their rage just as you kick the parcel though in fairness you should kick the string and strange to say it was james_hook who told them to belay their violence
while his dogs were merely sweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one part he bulged out in another james_hook master mind had gone far beneath slightly surface probing not for effects but for causes and his exultation showed that he had found them
slightly white to the gills knew that james_hook had surprised discovered his secret which was this that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick
poor slightly most wretched of all the child now for he was in a panic about peter_pan bitterly regretted what he had done
madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was hot he had swelled in consequence to his present girth and instead of reducing himself to fit his tree he had unknown to the others whittled his tree to make it fit him
sufficient of this james_hook guessed to persuade him that peter_pan at last lay at his mercy but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips he merely signed that the captives were to be conveyed to the ship and that he would be alone
hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down hill like barrels but most of the way lay through a morass
his lip was curled with malicious triumph how to convey them again james_hook genius surmounted difficulties he indicated that the little house must be used as a conveyance
the child were flung into it four stout pirate raised it on their shoulders the others fell in behind and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession set off through the wood
i dont know whether any of the child were crying if so the singing drowned the sound but as the little house disappeared in the forest a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from its chimney as if defying james_hook
james_hook saw it and it did peter_pan a bad service it dried up any trickle of pity for him that may have remained in the pirate infuriated breast
the first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was to tiptoe to slightly tree and make sure that it provided him with a passage
then for long he remained brooding his hat of ill omen on the sward so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his hair
intently he listened for any sound from the nether world but all was as silent below as above the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void
was that boy asleep or did he stand waiting at the foot of slightly tree with his dagger in his hand
dark as were his thoughts his blue eye were as soft as the periwinkle there was no way of knowing save by going down
james_hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them he stepped into the tree
he was a brave man but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow which was dripping like a candle
he arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft and stood still again biting at his breath which had almost left him
as his eye became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the tree took shape but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested long sought for and found at last was the great bed
unaware of the tragedy being enacted above peter_pan had continued for a little time after the child left to play gaily on his pipes
then silently he let himself go into the unknown on the bed lay peter_pan fast asleep no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care
then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet to vex her still more for she had always tucked them inside it because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night
then he decided not to take his medicine so as to grieve wendy then he nearly cried but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead
so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it sometimes though not often he had dreams and they were more painful than the dreams of other boy
for hours he could not be separated from these dreams though he wailed piteously in them they had to do i think with the riddle of his existence
at such time it had been wendy custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap soothing him in dear way of her own invention and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him
one arm dropped over the edge of the bed one leg was arched and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth which was open showing the little pearls
but on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep thus defenceless james_hook found him he stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy
did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast the man was not wholly evil he loved flowers i have been told and sweet music he was himself
no mean performer on the harpsichord and let it be frankly admitted the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly
mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree but for one thing what stayed him was peter_pan impertinent appearance as he slept
the open mouth the drooping arm the arched knee they were such a personification of cockiness as taken together will never again one may hope be presented to eye so sensitive to their offensiveness
if his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident and leapt at the sleeper
though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed james_hook stood in darkness himself and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle the door of slightly tree
they steeled james_hook heart it did not entirely fill the aperture and he had been looking over it feeling for the catch he found to his fury that it was low down beyond his reach
to his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in peter_pan face and figure visibly increased and he rattled the door and flung himself against it
was his enemy to escape him after all but what was that the red in his eye had caught sight of peter_pan medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach
lest he should be taken alive james_hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug blended by himself of all the death dealing rings that had come into his possession
these he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science which was probably the most virulent poison in existence
he fathomed what it was straightaway and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power five drops of this he now added to peter_pan cup
as he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper but not lest pity should unnerve him merely to avoid spilling
his hand shook but it was in exultation rather than in shame then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim and turning wormed his way with difficulty up the tree
donning his hat at its most rakish angle he wound his cloak around him holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night of which it was the blackest part and muttering strangely to himself stole away through the tree
as he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole peter_pan slept on the light guttered burned to edges and went out leaving the tenement in darkness but still he slept
it must have been not less than ten clock by the crocodile when he suddenly sat up in his bed wakened by he
knew not what it was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree soft and cautious but in that stillness it was sinister
peter_pan felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it then he spoke who is that for long there was no answer then again the knock
who are you no answer he was thrilled and he loved being thrilled in two strides he reached the door
unlike slightly door it filled the aperture opening so that he could not see beyond it nor could the one knocking see him
i wont open unless you speak peter_pan cried then at last the visitor spoke in a lovely bell like voice let me in peter_pan
it was tink and quickly he unbarred to her she flew in excitedly her face flushed and her dress stained with mud
what is it oh you could never guess she cried and offered him three guesses out with it
he shouted and in one ungrammatical sentence as long as the ribbons that conjurers magicians pull from their mouth she told of the capture of wendy and the boy
peter_pan heart bobbed up and down as he listened wendy bound and on the pirate ship she who loved everything to be just so
i ll rescue her he cried leaping at his weapons as he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her
he could take his medicine his hand closed on the fatal draught no shrieked tinker_bell who had heard james_hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest
why not it is poisoned poisoned who could have poisoned it james_hook dont be silly how could james_hook have got down here
alas tinker_bell could not explain this for even she did not know the dark secret of slightly tree nevertheless james_hook words had left no room for doubt
no time for words now time for deeds and with one of her lightning movements tink got between his lips and the draught and drained it to the dregs
the cup was poisoned besides said peter_pan quite believing himself i never fell asleep he raised the cup
why tink how dare you drink my medicine but she did not answer already she was reeling in the air
what is the matter with you cried peter_pan suddenly afraid it was poisoned peter_pan she told him softly and now i am going to be dead
her wings would scarcely carry her now but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite
tink did you drink it to save me yes but why tink she whispered in his ear you silly ass and then tottering to her chamber lay down on the bed
his head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress every moment her light was growing fainter and he knew that if it went out she would be no more
she liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said
then he made it out she was saying that she thought she could get well again if child believed in fairy
there were no child there and it was night time but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the neverland and who were therefore nearer to him than you think boy and girls in their nighties and naked papooses in their baskets hung from tree
peter_pan flung out his arm do you believe he cried tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate
she fancied she heard answers in the affirmative and then again she wasnt sure what do you think she asked peter_pan
if you believe he shouted to them clap your hand dont let tink die many clapped some didnt a few beasts hissed
the clapping stopped suddenly as if countless mother had rushed to their nursery to see what on earth was happening but already tink was saved
first her voice grew strong then she popped out of bed then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever
she never thought of thanking those who believed but she would have liked to get at the one who had hissed
the moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when peter_pan rose from his tree begirt belted with weapons and wearing little else to set out upon his perilous quest
he had hoped to fly keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eye but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the tree thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir
he regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach
and now to rescue wendy it was not such a night as he would have chosen there was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion at which happily he was an adept
a light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks and a deathly silence pervaded the island as if for a space nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage
he had taught the child something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from tiger_lily and tinker_bell and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it
expert but in what direction for he could not be sure that the child had been taken to the ship slightly if he had an opportunity would blaze cut a mark in
the tree for instance curly would drop seeds and wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place the morning was needed to search for such guidance and he could not wait
the crocodile passed him but not another living thing not a sound not a movement and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree or stalking him from behind
the upper world had called him but would give no help he swore this terrible oath james_hook or me this time
now he crawled forward like a snake and again erect he darted across a space on which the moonlight played one finger on his lip and his dagger at the ready
chapter the pirate ship one green light squinting over kidd creek which is near the mouth of the pirate river marked where the brig the jolly roger lay low in the water a rakish looking speedy looking craft foul to the hull every beam in her detestable like ground strewn with mangled feathers
she was the cannibal of the seas and scarce needed that watchful eye for she floated immune in the horror of her name
he was frightfully happy she was wrapped in the blanket of night through which no sound from her could have reached the shore
there was little sound and none agreeable save the whir of the ship sewing machine at which smee sat ever industrious and obliging the essence of the commonplace pathetic smee
i know not why he was so infinitely pathetic unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it but even strong man had to turn hastily from looking at him and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of james_hook tears and made it flow
a few of the pirate leant over the bulwarks drinking in the miasma putrid mist of the night others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of james_hook reach lest he should claw them mechanically in passing
of this as of almost everything else smee was quite unconscious james_hook trod the deck in thought man unfathomable it was his hour of triumph
peter_pan had been removed for ever from his path and all the other boy were in the brig about to walk the plank
it was his grimmest deed since the day when he had brought barbecue to heel and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily bellied out by the winds of his success
but there was no elation in his gait which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind james_hook was profoundly dejected
he was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night it was because he was so terribly alone
this inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs they were socially inferior to him james_hook was not his true name
to reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed he had been at a famous public school and its traditions still clung to him like garments with which indeed they are largely concerned
thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled attacked her and he still adhered in his walk to the school distinguished slouch
but above all he retained the passion for good form good form however much he may have degenerated he still knew that this is all that really matters
from far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals and through them came a stern tap tap tap like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep
have you been good form to day was their eternal question fame fame that glittering bauble it is mine he cried
is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything the tap tap from his school replied i am the only man whom barbecue feared he urged and flint feared barbecue
barbecue flint what house came the cutting retort most disquieting reflection of all was it not bad form to think about good form
it was a claw within him sharper than the iron one and as it tore him the perspiration dripped down his tallow waxy countenance and streaked his doublet
his vitals were tortured by this problem ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face but there was no damming that trickle
ah envy not james_hook there came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution death it was as if peter_pan terrible oath had boarded the ship
james_hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech lest presently there should be no time for it better for james_hook he cried if he had had less ambition
it was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person no little child to love me
strange that he should think of this which had never troubled him before perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind
for long he muttered to himself staring at smee who was hemming placidly under the conviction that all child feared him
feared him feared smee there was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him
he had said horrid thing to them and hit them with the palm of his hand because he could not hit with his fist but they had only clung to him the more
michael had tried on his spectacles to tell poor smee that they thought him lovable james_hook itched to do it but it seemed too brutal
instead he revolved this mystery in his mind why do they find smee lovable he pursued the problem like the sleuth hound that he was
if smee was lovable what was it that made him so a terrible answer suddenly presented itself good form had the bo sun good form without knowing it which is the best form of all
he remembered that you have to prove you dont know you have it before you are eligible for pop an elite social club at eton
with a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over smee head but he did not tear what arrested him was this reflection
to claw a man because he is good form what would that be bad form the unhappy james_hook was as impotent powerless as he was damp and he fell forward like a cut flower
his dogs thinking him out of the way for a time discipline instantly relaxed and they broke into a bacchanalian drunken dance which brought him to his feet at once all traces of human weakness gone as if a bucket of water had passed over him
quiet you scugs he cried or i ll cast anchor in you and at once the din was hushed are all the child chained so that they cannot fly away
ay ay then hoist them up the wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold all except wendy and ranged in line in front of him
for a time he seemed unconscious of their presence he lolled at his ease humming not unmelodiously snatches of a rude song and fingering a pack of cards
now then bullies he said briskly six of you walk the plank to night but i have room for two cabin boy
ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face which of you is it to be
tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person and though a somewhat silly boy he knew that mother alone are always willing to be the buffer
dont irritate him unnecessarily had been wendy instructions in the hold so tootles stepped forward politely all child know this about mother and despise them for it but make constant use of it
so tootles explained prudently you see sir i dont think my mother would like me to be a pirate would your mother like you to be a pirate slightly
he winked at slightly who said mournfully i dont think so as if he wished thing had been otherwise
would your mother like you to be a pirate twin i dont think so said the first twin as clever as the others
nibs would stow this gab roared james_hook and the spokesmen were dragged back you boy he said addressing john you look as if you had a little pluck in you
didst never want to be a pirate my hearty now john had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths prep and he was struck by james_hook picking him out
i once thought of calling myself red handed jack he said diffidently and a good name too we ll call you that here bully if you join
what do you think michael asked john what would you call me if i join michael demanded blackbeard joe
michael was naturally impressed what do you think john he wanted john to decide and john wanted him to decide
shall we still be respectful subjects of the king john inquired through james_hook teeth came the answer you would have to swear down with the king
perhaps john had not behaved very well so far but he shone out now then i refuse he cried banging the barrel in front of james_hook
and i refuse cried michael rule britannia squeaked curly the infuriated pirate buffeted them in the mouth and james_hook roared out that seals your doom
bring up their mother get the plank ready they were only boy and they went white as they saw jukes and cecco preparing the fatal plank
but they tried to look brave when wendy was brought up no words of mine can tell you how wendy despised those pirate
to the boy there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years
there was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger dirty pig and she had already written it on several
but as the boy gathered round her she had no thought of course save for them so my beauty said james_hook as if he spoke in syrup you are to see your child walk the plank
fine gentlemen though he was the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it
with a hasty gesture he tried to hide it but he was too late are they to die asked wendy with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted
they are he snarled silence all he called gloatingly for a mother last words to her child at this moment wendy was grand
these are my last words dear boy she said firmly i feel that i have a message to you from your real mother and it is this
we hope our sons will die like english gentlemen even the pirate were awed and tootles cried out hysterically i am going to do what my mother hopes
what are you to do nibs what my mother hopes what are you to do twin what my mother hopes john what are
but james_hook had found his voice again tie her up he shouted it was smee who tied her to the mast
see here honey he whispered i ll save you if you promise to be my mother but not even for smee would she make such a promise
it is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as smee tied her to the mast the eye of all were on the plank that last little walk they were about to take
they were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully for the capacity to think had gone from them they could stare and shiver only
i would almost rather have no child at all she said disdainfully scornfully james_hook smiled on them with his teeth closed and took a step toward wendy
his intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boy walking the plank one by one but he never reached her he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her
they all heard it pirate boy wendy and immediately every head was blown in one direction not to the water whence the sound proceeded but toward james_hook
all knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators
he heard something else instead it was the terrible tick tick of the crocodile very frightful was it to see the change that came over him
the sound came steadily nearer and in advance of it came this ghastly thought the crocodile is about to board the ship
even the iron claw hung inactive as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted
left so fearfully alone any other man would have lain with his eye shut where he fell but the gigantic brain of james_hook was still working and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go
the pirate respectfully cleared a passage for him and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke
it was as if he had been clipped at every joint he fell in a little heap hide me he cried hoarsely
they gathered round him all eye averted from the thing that was coming aboard they had no thought of fighting it
only when james_hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boy so that they could rush to the ship side to see the crocodile climbing it
then they got the strangest surprise of the night of night for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid
it was fate it was peter_pan he signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion
odd thing happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened
thus to take an instance we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we dont know how long but say half an hour
then he went on ticking chapter james_hook or me this time now such an experience had come that night to peter_pan
when last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready
he had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking
without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion peter_pan began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use and he decided to tick so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested
at first he thought this eerie but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down he ticked superbly but with one unforeseen result
the crocodile was among those who heard the sound and it followed him though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself will never be certainly known for like slaves to a fixed idea it was a stupid beast
peter_pan reached the shore without mishap and went straight on his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element
thus many animals pass from land to water but no other human of whom i know as he swam he had
but one thought james_hook or me this time he had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it
had he known he would have stopped for to board the brig by help of the tick though an ingenious idea had not occurred to him
on the contrary he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse and he was amazed to see the pirate cowering from him with james_hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile
the crocodile no sooner did peter_pan remember it than he heard the ticking at first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile and he looked behind him swiftly
then he realised that he was doing it himself and in a flash he understood the situation how clever of me
he thought at once and signed to the boy not to burst into applause it was at this moment that ed teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck
now reader time what happened by your watch peter_pan struck true and deep john clapped his hand on the ill fated pirate mouth to stifle the dying groan
he fell forward four boy caught him to prevent the thud peter_pan gave the signal and the carrion was cast overboard
none too soon peter_pan every inch of him on tiptoe vanished into the cabin for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round
there was a splash and then silence how long has it taken one slightly had begun to count they could hear each other distressed breathing now which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed
slowly james_hook let his head emerge from his ruff and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick
it gone captain smee said wiping off his spectacles all still again there was not a sound and he drew himself up firmly to his full height
then here to johnny plank he cried brazenly hating the boy more than ever because they had seen him unbend
he broke into the villainous ditty yo ho yo ho the frisky plank you walks along it so till it goes down and you goes down to davy jones below
to terrorize the prisoners the more though with a certain loss of dignity he danced along an imaginary plank grimacing at them as he sang and when he finished he cried do you want a touch of the cat nine tails before you walk the plank
at that they fell on their knees no no they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled fetch the cat jukes said james_hook it in the cabin
the cabin peter_pan was in the cabin the child gazed at each other ay ay said jukes blithely and he strode into the cabin
they followed him with their eye they scarce knew that james_hook had resumed his song his dogs joining in with him yo ho yo ho the scratching cat its tails are nine you know and when they re writ upon your back what was the last line will never be known for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin
then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boy but to the pirate was almost more eerie than the screech
it wailed through the ship and died away what was that cried james_hook two said slightly solemnly the italian cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin
he tottered out haggard what the matter with bill jukes you dog hissed james_hook towering over him the matter wi him is he dead stabbed replied cecco in a hollow voice
the cabin as black as a pit cecco said almost gibbering but there is something terrible in there the thing you heard crowing
bill jukes dead cried the startled pirate the exultation of the boy the lowering looks of the pirate both were seen by james_hook
cecco he said in his most steely voice go back and fetch me out that doodle doo cecco bravest of the brave cowered before his captain crying no no but james_hook was purring to his claw
did you say you would go cecco he said musingly cecco went first flinging his arm despairingly there was no more singing
all listened now and again came a death screech and again a crow no one spoke except slightly three he said
james_hook rallied his dogs with a gesture death and odds fish he thundered who is to bring me that doodle doo
wait till cecco comes out growled starkey and the others took up the cry i think i heard you volunteer starkey said james_hook purring again
no by thunder starkey cried my james_hook thinks you did said james_hook crossing to him i wonder if it would not be advisable starkey to humour the james_hook
i ll swing before i go in there replied starkey doggedly and again he had the support of the crew is this mutiny
asked james_hook more pleasantly than ever starkey ringleader captain mercy starkey whimpered all of a tremble now
shake hand starkey said james_hook proffering his claw starkey looked round for help but all deserted him as he backed up james_hook advanced and now the red spark was in his eye
with a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon long tom and precipitated himself into the sea four said slightly and now james_hook said courteously did any other gentlemen say mutiny
seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture i ll bring out that doodle doo myself he said and sped into the cabin
five how slightly longed to say it he wetted his lips to be ready but james_hook came staggering out without his lantern
something blew out the light he said a little unsteadily something echoed mullins what of cecco demanded noodler
he as dead as jukes said james_hook shortly his reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably and the mutinous sound again broke forth
all pirate are superstitious and cookson cried they do say the surest sign a ship accurst is when there one on board more than can be accounted for
they say said another looking viciously at james_hook that when he comes it in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard
i ve heard muttered mullins he always boards the pirate craft last had he a tail captain had he a james_hook captain asked cookson insolently and one after another took up the cry the ship doomed
at this the child could not resist raising a cheer james_hook had well nigh forgotten his prisoners but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again
lads he cried to his crew now here a notion open the cabin door and drive them in let them fight the doodle doo for their lives
if they kill him we re so much the better if he kills them we re none the worse for the last time his dogs admired james_hook and devotedly they did his bidding
the boy pretending to struggle were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them now listen cried james_hook and all listened
but not one dared to face the door yes one wendy who all this time had been bound to the mast
it was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching it was for the reappearance of peter_pan she had not long to wait
in the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search the key that would free the child of their manacles and now they all stole forth armed with such weapons as they could find
first signing them to hide peter_pan cut wendy bonds and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together but one thing barred the way an oath james_hook or me this time
so when he had freed wendy he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others and himself took her place by the mast her cloak around him so that he should pass for her
to the pirate it was a voice crying that all the boy lay slain in the cabin and they were panic stricken
james_hook tried to hearten them but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs and he knew that if he took his eye off them now they would leap at him
lads he said ready to cajole or strike as need be but never quailing for an instant i ve thought it out
then he took a great breath and crowed there a jonah aboard ay they snarled a man wi a james_hook
no lads no it the girl never was luck on a pirate ship wi a woman on board we ll right the ship when she gone
some of them remembered that this had been a saying of flint it worth trying they said doubtfully
fling the girl overboard cried james_hook and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak there none can save you now missy
mullins hissed jeeringly there one replied the figure who that peter_pan the avenger came the terrible answer and as he spoke peter_pan flung off his cloak
then they all knew who twas that had been undoing them in the cabin and twice james_hook essayed to speak and twice he failed
in that frightful moment i think his fierce heart broke at last he cried cleave him to the brisket but without conviction
down boy and at them peter_pan voice rang out and in another moment the clash of arm was resounding through the ship
had the pirate kept together it is certain that they would have won but the onset came when they were still unstrung and they ran hither and thither striking wildly each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew
man to man they were the stronger but they fought on the defensive only which enabled the boy to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry
some of the miscreants leapt into the sea others hid in dark recesses where they were found by slightly who did not fight but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their face so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boy
there was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons an occasional screech or splash and slightly monotonously counting five six seven eight nine ten eleven
i think all were gone when a group of savage boy surrounded james_hook who seemed to have a charmed life as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire
they had done for his dogs but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all again and again they closed upon him and again and again he hewed a clear space
he had lifted up one boy with his james_hook and was using him as a buckler shield when another who had just passed his sword through mullins sprang into the fray
put up your swords boy cried the newcomer this man is mine thus suddenly james_hook found himself face to face with peter_pan
for long the two enemies looked at one another james_hook shuddering slightly and peter_pan with the strange smile upon his face
the others drew back and formed a ring around them so peter_pan said james_hook at last this is all your doing
ay james_hook came the stern answer it is all my doing proud and insolent youth said james_hook prepare to meet thy doom
dark and sinister man peter_pan answered have at thee without more words they fell to and for a space there was no advantage to either blade
peter_pan was a superb swordsman and parried with dazzling rapidity ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe defence but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead and he could not drive the steel home
james_hook scarcely his inferior in brilliancy but not quite so nimble in wrist play forced him back by the weight of his onset hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust taught him long ago by barbecue at rio but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again
then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron james_hook which all this time had been pawing the air but peter_pan doubled under it and lunging fiercely pierced him in the ribs
at the sight of his own blood whose peculiar colour you remember was offensive to him the sword fell from james_hook hand and he was at peter_pan mercy
now cried all the boy but with a magnificent gesture peter_pan invited his opponent to pick up his sword james_hook did so instantly but with a tragic feeling that peter_pan was showing good form
hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him but darker suspicions assailed him now peter_pan who and what art thou he cried huskily
i youth i joy peter_pan answered at a venture i a little bird that has broken out of the egg
this of course was nonsense but it was proof to the unhappy james_hook that peter_pan did not know in the least who or what he was which is the very pinnacle of good form
he fought now like a human flail and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it but peter_pan fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone
tot again he cried despairingly and again and again he darted in and pricked james_hook was fighting now without hope
that passionate breast no longer asked for life but for one boon it craved to see peter_pan show bad form before it was cold forever
abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it in two minutes he cried the ship will be blown to pieces
now now he thought true form will show but peter_pan issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hand and calmly flung it overboard
misguided man though he was we may be glad without sympathising with him that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race
the other boy were flying around him now flouting scornful and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently his mind was no longer with them it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago or being sent up to the headmaster for good or watching the wall game from a famous wall
what sort of form was james_hook himself showing and his shoes were right and his waistcoat was right and his tie was right and his socks were right
seeing peter_pan slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea
he did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him a little mark of respect from us at the end
james_hook thou not wholly unheroic figure farewell for we have come to his last moment he had one last triumph which i think we need not grudge him
as he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at peter_pan gliding through the air he invited him with a gesture to use his foot
it made peter_pan kick instead of stab at last james_hook had got the boon for which he craved bad form he cried jeeringly and went content to the crocodile
fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night but two reached the shore starkey to be captured by the redskins who made him nurse for all their papooses a melancholy come down for a pirate and smee who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that jas
thus perished james_hook seventeen slightly sang out but he was not quite correct in his figures james_hook had feared
wendy of course had stood by taking no part in the fight though watching peter_pan with glistening eye but now that all was over she became prominent again
she praised them equally and shuddered delightfully when michael showed her the place where he had killed one and then she took them into james_hook cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail
it said half past one the lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all she got them to bed in the pirate bunks pretty quickly you may be sure
all but peter_pan who strutted up and down on the deck until at last he fell asleep by the side of long tom
he had one of his dreams that night and cried in his sleep for a long time and wendy held him tightly
by three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps legs for there was a big sea running and tootles the bo sun was among them with a rope end in his hand and chewing tobacco
they all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee shaved smartly and tumbled up with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers
chapter the return home it need not be said who was the captain nibs and john were first and second mate
peter_pan had already lashed himself to the wheel but he piped all hand and delivered a short address to them said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties but that he knew they were the scum of rio and the gold coast and if they snapped at him he would tear them
there was a woman aboard the rest were tars sailors before the mast and lived in the fo sle the bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood and they cheered him lustily
captain peter_pan calculated after consulting the ship chart that if this weather lasted they should strike the azores about the st of june after which it would save time to fly
some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate but the captain treated them as dogs and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin one person after another as they had to cpt
then a few sharp orders were given and they turned the ship round and nosed her for the mainland james_hook instant obedience was the only safe thing
the general feeling was that peter_pan was honest just now to lull wendy suspicions but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready which against her will she was making for him out of some of james_hook wickedest garments
it was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with james_hook cigar holder in his mouth and
slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings one hand clenched all but for the forefinger which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a james_hook
instead of watching the ship however we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago
it seems a shame to have neglected no all this time and yet we may be sure that mrs_darling does not blame us
if we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her she would probably have cried dont be silly what do i matter
so long as mother are like this their child will take advantage of them and they may lay to bet on that
even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their bed are properly aired and that mr and mrs_darling do not go out for the evening
do go back and keep an eye on the child we are no more than servants why on earth should their bed be properly aired seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry
would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week end in the country
it would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them but if we contrived thing in this way mrs_darling would never forgive us
one thing i should like to do immensely and that is to tell her in the way authors have that the child are coming back that indeed they will be here on thursday week
they have been planning it out on the ship mother rapture father shout of joy nana leap through the air to embrace them first when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding
how delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance so that when they enter grandly mrs_darling may not even offer wendy her mouth and mr_darling may exclaim pettishly dash it all here are those boy again
this would spoil so completely the surprise to which wendy and john and michael are looking forward however we should get no thanks even for this
we are beginning to know mrs_darling by this time and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the child of their little pleasure
but my dear madam it is ten day till thursday week so that by telling you what what we can save you ten day of unhappiness
yes but at what a cost by depriving the child of ten minutes of delight oh if you look at it in that way
what other way is there in which to look at it you see the woman had no proper spirit
i had meant to say extraordinarily nice thing about her but i despise her and not one of them will i say now
she does not really need to be told to have thing ready for they are ready all the bed are aired and she never leaves the house and observe the window is open
for all the use we are to her we might well go back to the ship however as we are here we may as well stay and look on
that is all we are lookers on nobody really wants us so let us watch and say jaggy thing in the hope that some of them will hurt
the only change to be seen in the night nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there
when the child flew away mr_darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained nana up and that from first to last she had been wiser than he
of course as we have seen he was quite a simple man indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion courage to do what seemed right to him and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the child he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel
to all mrs_darling dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly no my own one this is the place for me
in the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel until his child came back
of course this was a pity but whatever mr_darling did he had to do in excess otherwise he soon gave up doing it
and there never was a more humble man than the once proud george_darling as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their child and all their pretty way
very touching was his deference to nana he would not let her come into the kennel but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly
every morning the kennel was carried with mr_darling in it to a cab which conveyed him to his office and he returned home in the same way at six
something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention
inwardly he must have suffered torture but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside
it may have been quixotic but it was magnificent soon the inward meaning of it leaked out and the great heart of the public was touched
crowds followed the cab cheering it lustily charming girls scaled it to get his autograph interviews appeared in the better class of papers and society invited him to dinner and added do come in the kennel
now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old day all gone now just because she has lost her babes i find i wont be able to say nasty thing about her after all
on that eventful thursday week mrs_darling was in the night nursery awaiting george_darling return home a very sad eyed woman if she was too fond of her rubbishy child she couldnt help it
look at her in her chair where she has fallen asleep the corner of her mouth where one looks first is almost withered up
her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there some like peter_pan best and some like wendy best but i like her best
they are really within two miles of the window now and flying strong but all we need whisper is that they are on the way
it is a pity we did it for she has started up calling their names and there is no one in the room but nana
suppose to make her happy we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back let o nana i dreamt my dear one had come back
nana had filmy eye but all she could do was put her paw gently on her mistress lap and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back
as mr_darling puts his head out to kiss his wife we see that his face is more worn than of yore but has a softer expression
he gave his hat to liza who took it scornfully for she had no imagination and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man
outside the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering and he was naturally not unmoved listen to them he said it is very gratifying
there were several adults to day he assured her with a faint flush but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her
for some time he sat with his head out of the kennel talking with mrs_darling of this success and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it
lots of little boy sneered liza social success had not spoilt him it had made him sweeter but if i had been a weak man he said
good heavens if i had been a weak man and george_darling she said timidly you are as full of remorse as ever arent you
full of remorse as ever dearest see my punishment living in a kennel but it is punishment isnt it george_darling
you are sure you are not enjoying it my love you may be sure she begged his pardon and then feeling drowsy he curled round in the kennel
wont you play me to sleep he asked on the nursery piano and as she was crossing to the day nursery he added thoughtlessly and shut that window
i feel a draught george_darling never ask me to do that the window must always be left open for them always always
now it was his turn to beg her pardon and she went into the day nursery and played and soon he was asleep and while he slept wendy and john and michael flew into the room
we have written it so because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship but something must have happened since then for it is not they who have flown in it is peter_pan and tinker_bell
now you and i must get away by the door and when wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out and she will have to go back with me
oh no peter_pan first words tell all quick tink he whispered close the window bar it that right
now i understand what had hitherto puzzled me why when peter_pan had exterminated the pirate he did not return to the island and leave tink to escort the child to the mainland
instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee then he peeped into the day nursery to see who was playing
this trick had been in his head all the time he whispered to tink it wendy mother she is a pretty lady but not so pretty as my mother
her mouth is full of thimbles but not so full as my mother was of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother but he sometimes bragged about her
he did not know the tune which was home sweet home but he knew it was saying come back wendy wendy wendy and he cried exultantly you will never see wendy again lady for the window is barred
he peeped in again to see why the music had stopped and now he saw that mrs_darling had laid her head on the box and that two tears were sitting on her eye
she wants me to unbar the window thought peter_pan but i wont not i he peeped again and the tears were still there or another two had taken their place
she awfully fond of wendy he said to himself he was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have wendy
the reason was so simple i fond of her too we cant both have her lady but the lady would not make the best of it and he was unhappy
he skipped about and made funny face but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him knocking
he ceased to look at her but even then she would not let go of him oh all right he said at last and gulped
come on tink he cried with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature we dont want any silly mother and he flew away
thus wendy and john and michael found the window open for them after all which of course was more than they deserved
then he unbarred the window they alighted on the floor quite unashamed of themselves and the youngest one had already forgotten his home
john he said looking around him doubtfully i think i have been here before of course you have you silly
there is your old bed so it is michael said but not with much conviction i say cried john the kennel and he dashed across to look into it
perhaps nana is inside it wendy said but john whistled hullo he said there a man inside it
he is not so big as the pirate i killed he said with such frank disappointment that i am glad mr_darling was asleep it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little michael say
it father exclaimed wendy let me see father michael begged eagerly and he took a good look wendy and john had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel
surely said john like one who had lost faith in his memory he used not to sleep in the kennel
john wendy said falteringly perhaps we dont remember the old life as well as we thought we did a chill fell upon them and serve them right
it is very careless of mother said that young scoundrel john not to be here when we come back
it was then that mrs_darling began playing again it mother cried wendy peeping so it is said john
then are you not really our mother wendy asked michael who was surely sleepy oh dear exclaimed wendy with her first real twinge of remorse for having gone it was quite time we came back
let us creep in john suggested and put our hand over her eye but wendy who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently had a better plan
let us all slip into our bed and be there when she comes in just as if we had never been away
and so when mrs_darling went back to the night nursery to see if her husband was asleep all the bed were occupied
the child waited for her cry of joy but it did not come she saw them but she did not believe they were there
you see she saw them in their bed so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still
she sat down in the chair by the fire where in the old day she had nursed them they could not understand this and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them
mother wendy cried that wendy she said but still she was sure it was the dream mother
that michael she said and she stretched out her arm for the three little selfish child they would never envelop again
yes they did they went round wendy and john and michael who had slipped out of bed and run to her
that john she said mother cried michael he knew her now george_darling george she cried when she could speak and mr_darling woke to share her bliss and nana came rushing in
there could not have been a lovelier sight but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window
he had had ecstasies innumerable that other child can never know but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred
they were waiting below to give wendy time to explain about them and when they had counted five hundred they went up
chapter when wendy grew up i hope you want to know what became of the other boy they went up by the stair because they thought this would make a better impression
they stood in a row in front of mrs_darling with their hats off and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes
they said nothing but their eye asked her to have them they ought to have looked at mr_darling also but they forgot about him
of course mrs_darling said at once that she would have them but mr_darling was curiously depressed and they saw that he considered six a rather large number
i must say he said to wendy that you dont do thing by halves a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them
the first twin was the proud one and he asked flushing do you think we should be too much of a handful sir
because if so we can go away father wendy cried shocked but still the cloud was on him he knew he was behaving unworthily but he could not help it
we could lie doubled up said nibs i always cut their hair myself said wendy george_darling mrs_darling exclaimed pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light
he was as glad to have them as she was he said but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers instead of treating him as a cypher zero in his own house
then he burst into tears and the truth came out i dont think he is a cypher tootles cried instantly
do you think he is a cypher curly no i dont do you think he is a cypher slightly
it turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher and he was absurdly gratified and said he would find space for them all in the drawing room if they fitted in
rather not twin what do you think we ll fit in sir they assured him then follow the leader he cried gaily
mind you i am not sure that we have a drawing room but we pretend we have and it all the same
he went off dancing through the house and they all cried hoop la and danced after him searching for the drawing room and i forget whether they found it but at any rate they found corners and they all fitted in
he did not exactly come to the window but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him
hoop la as for peter_pan he saw wendy once again before he flew away that is what she did
you dont feel peter_pan she said falteringly that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject
hullo wendy good bye he said oh dear are you going away yes no about me peter_pan no mrs_darling came to the window for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on wendy
she told peter_pan that she had adopted all the other boy and would like to adopt him also would you send me to school
he inquired craftily yes and then to an office i suppose so soon i would be a man
very soon i dont want to go to school and learn solemn thing he told her passionately i dont want to be a man
peter_pan said wendy the comforter i should love you in a beard and mrs_darling stretched out her arm to him but he repulsed her
o wendy mother if i was to wake up and feel there was a beard keep back lady no one is going to catch me and make me a man
but where are you going to live with tink in the house we built for wendy the fairy are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at night
how lovely cried wendy so longingly that mrs_darling tightened her grip i thought all the fairy were dead mrs_darling said
there are always a lot of young one explained wendy who was now quite an authority because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born and as there are always new babies there are always new fairy
they live in nests on the tops of tree and the mauve one are boy and the white one are girls and the blue one are just little sillies who are not sure what they are
i shall have such fun said peter_pan with eye on wendy it will be rather lonely in the evening she said sitting by the fire
i shall have tink tink cant go a twentieth part of the way round she reminded him a little tartly
sneaky tell tale tink called out from somewhere round the corner it doesnt matter peter_pan said peter_pan you know it matters
well then come with me to the little house may i mummy certainly not i have got you home again and i mean to keep you
oh all right peter_pan said as if he had asked her from politeness merely but mrs_darling saw his mouth twitch and she made this handsome offer to let wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning
wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming but this promise sent peter_pan away quite gay again
he had no sense of time and was so full of adventures that all i have told you about him is only a halfpenny worth of them
i suppose it was because wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive one you wont forget me peter_pan will you before spring cleaning time comes
but he does so need a mother so do you my love of course peter_pan promised and then he flew away
he took mrs_darling kiss with him the kiss that had been for no one else peter_pan took quite easily funny
of course all the boy went to school and most of them got into class iii but slightly was put first into class iv and then into class class
before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island but it was too late now and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or jenkins minor
but she seemed satisfied i is the top class the younger jenkins it is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them
at first nana tied their feet to the bed posts so that they should not fly away in the night and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses the english double deckers but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus
in time they could not even fly after their hats want of practice they called it but what it really meant was that they no longer believed
michael believed longer than the other boy though they jeered at him so he was with wendy when peter_pan came for her at the end of the first year
she flew away with peter_pan in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the neverland and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become but he never noticed he had so much to say about himself
she had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old time but new adventures had crowded the old one from his mind
who is captain james_hook he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch enemy dont you remember she asked amazed how you killed him and saved all our lives
when she expressed a doubtful hope that tinker_bell would be glad to see her he said who is tinker_bell
i forget them after i kill them he replied carelessly peter_pan she said shocked but even when she explained he could not remember
i expect he was right for fairy dont live long but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them
wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to peter_pan it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her
but he was exactly as fascinating as ever and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops
there are such a lot of them he said i expect she is no more next year he did not come for her
she waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet but he never came perhaps he is ill michael said
you know he is never ill michael came close to her and whispered with a shiver perhaps there is no such person wendy
and then wendy would have cried if michael had not been crying peter_pan came next spring cleaning and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year
for a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge
but the years came and went without bringing the careless boy and when they met again wendy was a married woman and peter_pan was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys
that was the last time the girl wendy ever saw him wendy was grown up you need not be sorry for her
she was one of the kind that likes to grow up in the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls
all the boy were grown up and done for by this time so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them
you may see the twins and nibs and curly any day going to an office each carrying a little bag and an umbrella
michael is an engine driver train engineer slightly married a lady of title and so he became a lord you see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door
that used to be tootles the bearded man who doesnt know any story to tell his child was once john wendy was married in white with a pink sash
it is strange to think that peter_pan did not alight in the church and forbid the banns formal announcement of a marriage years rolled on again and wendy had a daughter
she was called jane and always had an odd inquiring look as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions
this ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash when she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about peter_pan
she loved to hear of peter_pan and wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place
it was jane nursery now for her father had bought it at the three per cents mortgage rate from wendy father who was no longer fond of stairs
there were only two bed in the nursery now jane and her nurse and there was no kennel for nana also had passed away
she died of old age and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after child except herself
mrs_darling was now dead and forgotten once a week jane nurse had her evening off and then it was wendy part to put jane to bed
it was jane invention to raise the sheet over her mother head and her own thus making a tent and in the awful darkness to whisper what do we see now
i dont think i see anything to night says wendy with a feeling that if nana were here she would object to further conversation
that was the time for story yes you do says jane you see when you were a little girl
that is a long time ago sweetheart says wendy ah me how time flies does it fly asks the artful child the way you flew when you were a little girl
the way i flew do you know jane i sometimes wonder whether i ever did really fly yes you did
the dear old day when i could fly why cant you fly now mother because i am grown up dearest
when people grow up they forget the way why do they forget the way because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless
it is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly what is gay and innocent and heartless i do wish i were gay and innocent and heartless
or perhaps wendy admits she does see something i do believe she says that it is this nursery i do believe it is says jane
go on they are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when peter_pan flew in looking for his shadow
the foolish fellow says wendy tried to stick it on with soap and when he could not he cried and that woke me and i sewed it on for him
you have missed a bit interrupts jane who now knows the story better than her mother when you saw him sitting on the floor crying what did you say
i sat up in bed and i said boy why are you crying yes that was it says jane with a big breath
and then he flew us all away to the neverland and the fairy and the pirate and the redskins and the mermaids lagoon and the home under the ground and the little house
yes which did you like best of all i think i liked the home under the ground best of all
the last thing he ever said to me was just always be waiting for me and then some night you will hear me crowing
yes so do i what was the last thing peter_pan ever said to you yes but alas he forgot all about me wendy said it with a smile
she was as grown up as that what did his crow sound like jane asked one evening it was like this wendy said trying to imitate peter_pan crow
no it wasnt jane said gravely it was like this and she did it ever so much better than her mother
wendy was a little startled my darling how can you know i often hear it when i am sleeping jane said
ah yes many girls hear it when they are sleeping but i was the only one who heard it awake
it was the spring of the year and the story had been told for the night and jane was now asleep in her bed
wendy was sitting on the floor very close to the fire so as to see to darn for there was no other light in the nursery and while she sat darning she heard a crow
lucky you said jane and then one night came the tragedy then the window blew open as of old and peter_pan dropped in on the floor
he was exactly the same as ever and wendy saw at once that he still had all his first teeth he was a little boy and she was grown up
hullo wendy he said not noticing any difference for he was thinking chiefly of himself and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first
she huddled by the fire not daring to move helpless and guilty a big woman hullo peter_pan she replied faintly squeezing herself as small as possible
something inside her was crying woman woman let go of me hullo where is john he asked suddenly missing the third bed
john is not here now she gasped is michael asleep he asked with a careless glance at jane
yes she answered and now she felt that she was untrue to jane as well as to peter_pan that is not michael she said quickly lest a judgment should fall on her
peter_pan looked hullo is it a new one yes boy or girl girl now surely he would understand but not a bit of it
peter_pan she said faltering are you expecting me to fly away with you of course that is why i have come
he added a little sternly have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time she knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning time pass
i cant come she said apologetically i have forgotten how to fly i ll soon teach you again peter_pan dont waste the fairy dust on me
she had risen and now at last a fear assailed him what is it he cried shrinking
i will turn up the light she said and then you can see for yourself for almost the only time in his life that i know of peter_pan was afraid
she was not a little girl heart broken about him she was a grown woman smiling at it all but they were wet eyed smiles
dont turn up the light he cried she let her hand play in the hair of the tragic boy then she turned up the light and peter_pan saw
he gave a cry of pain and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arm he drew back sharply
what is it he cried again she had to tell him i am old peter_pan i am ever so much more than twenty
i grew up long ago you promised not to i couldnt help it i am a married woman peter_pan
no you re not yes and the little girl in the bed is my baby no she not
but he supposed she was and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised of course he did not strike
he sat down on the floor instead and sobbed and wendy did not know how to comfort him though she could have done it so easily once
she was only a woman now and she ran out of the room to try to think peter_pan continued to cry and soon his sobs woke jane
she sat up in bed and was interested at once boy she said why are you crying peter_pan rose and bowed to her and she bowed to him from the bed
hullo he said hullo said jane my name is peter_pan he told her yes i know
i came back for my mother he explained to take her to the neverland yes i know jane said i have been waiting for you
when wendy returned diffidently she found peter_pan sitting on the bed post crowing gloriously while jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn ecstasy
she is my mother peter_pan explained and jane descended and stood by his side with the look in her face that he liked to see on lady when they gazed at him
yes i know wendy admitted rather forlornly no one knows it so well as i good bye said peter_pan to wendy and he rose in the air and the shameless jane rose with him
he does so need a mother jane said it was already her easiest way of moving about
wendy rushed to the window no no she cried it is just for spring cleaning time jane said he wants me always to do his spring cleaning
if only i could go with you wendy sighed you see you cant fly said jane of course in the end wendy let them fly away together
our last glimpse of her shows her at the window watching them receding into the sky until they were as small as stars
as you look at wendy you may see her hair becoming white and her figure little again for all this happened long ago
jane is now a common grown up with a daughter called margaret and every spring cleaning time except when he forgets peter_pan comes for margaret and takes her to the neverland where she tells him story about himself to which he listens eagerly
when margaret grows up she will have a daughter who is to be peter_pan mother in turn and thus it will go on so long as child are gay and innocent and heartless
