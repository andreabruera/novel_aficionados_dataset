hard time for these time commonly known as hard time is the tenth novel by charles dickens first published in
the book surveys english society and satirises the social and economic conditions of the era hard time is unusual in several way
it is by far the shortest of dickens novels barely quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it
also unlike all but one of his other novels hard time has neither preface nor illustrations moreover it is his only novel not to have scenes set in london
instead the story is set in the fictitious victorian industrial coketown generic northern english mill town in some way similar to manchester though smaller
one of dickens reasons for writing hard time was that sales of his weekly periodical household word were low and it was hoped the novel publication in instalments would boost circulation as indeed proved to be the case
critics such as george bernard shaw and mr_thomas_gradgrind macaulay have mainly focused on dickens treatment of trade unions and his post industrial revolution pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the victorian era
f leavis great admirer of the book included it but not dickens work as whole as part of his great tradition of english novels
coketown may be partially based on century preston since publication it has received mixed response from critics the role of status on morality
sales were highly responsive and encouraging for dickens who remarked that he was three part mad and the fourth delirious with perpetual rushing at hard time
the novel was published as serial in dickens weekly publication household word the novel was serialised in twenty weekly part between april and august

utilitarianism was prevalent school of thought during this period its founders being jeremy bentham and mr_james_harthouse mill father to political theorist john stuart mill
the utilitarians were one of the targets of dickens satire bentham former secretary edwin chadwick helped design the poor law of which deliberately made workhouse life as uncomfortable as possible
dickens was appalled by what he saw as selfish philosophy which was combined with materialist laissez faire capitalism in the education of some child at the time as well as in industrial practices
in dickens interpretation the prevalence of utilitarian values in educational institutions promoted contempt between mill owners and workers creating young adults whose imaginations had been neglected due to an over emphasis on fact at the expense of more imaginative pursuits
dickens wished to satirise radical utilitarians whom he described in letter to charles knight as see figure and averages and nothing else
in the novel this attitude is conveyed in bitzer response to mr_thomas_gradgrind appeal for compassion he also wished to campaign for reform of working conditions
drawing upon his own childhood experiences dickens resolved to strike the heaviest blow in my power for those who laboured in horrific conditions
dickens had visited factories in manchester as early as and was appalled by the environment in which workers toiled john stuart mill had similar rigorous education to that of miss_louisa mr_thomas_gradgrind consisting of analytical logical mathematical and statistical exercises
in his twenties mill had nervous breakdown believing his capacity for emotion had been enervated by his father stringent emphasis on analysis and mathematics in his education
in the book miss_louisa herself follows parallel course being unable to express herself and falling into temporary depression as result of her dry education
the bastion of fact is the eminently practical mr_thomas_gradgrind and his model school which teaches nothing but fact any imaginative or aesthetic subjects are absent from the curriculum and analysis deduction and mathematics are emphasised
fancy the opposite of fact is epitomised by mr_sleary circus mr_sleary is reckoned fool by mr_thomas_gradgrind and mr_bounderby but it is mr_sleary who understands that people must be amused
sissy_jupe the circus performer daughter does badly at school failing to remember the many fact she is taught but is genuinely virtuous and fulfilled
mr_thomas_gradgrind own son tom_gradgrind revolts against his upbringing and becomes gambler and thief while miss_louisa becomes emotionally stunted virtually soulless both as young child and as an unhappily married woman
mr_bounderby spends his whole time fabricating stories about his childhood covering up the real nature of his upbringing which is revealed at the end of the novel
while not snooper himself he is undone by mrs_sparsit unwittingly revealing the mysterious old woman to be his own mother and she unravels josiah_bounderby secrets about his upbringing and fictitious stories
mr_bounderby himself superintends through calculating tabular statements and statistics and is always secretly rebuking the people of coketown for indulging in conceitful activities
this gives mr_bounderby sense of superiority as it does with mrs_sparsit who prides herself on her salacious knowledge gained from spying on others
mr_bounderby grasp for superiority is seen in blackpool talks to mr_bounderby regarding divorce proceedings and union movement at his factory accusing him that he is on quest to feast on turtle soup and venison served with golden spoon
bitzer who adheres to mr_thomas_gradgrind teachings becomes an uncompassionate egotist all superintendents of the novel are undone in one way or another
dickens portrays the wealthy in this novel as being morally corrupt mr_bounderby has no moral scruples and for example fires blackpool for novelty
mr_james_harthouse leisured gent is compared to an iceberg who will cause wreck unwittingly due to him being not moral sort of fellow as he states himself
stephen_blackpool destitute worker is equipped with perfect morals always abiding by his promises and always thoughtful and considerate of others as is sissy_jupe
the role of status on morality dickens is also concerned throughout hard time with the effects of social class on the morality of individuals
he also conducts himself without any shred of decency frequently losing his temper he is cynically false about his childhood some contrasting characters relating to this theme are stephen_blackpool and rachel and tom_gradgrind and mr_bounderby
stephen_blackpool honesty and rachel caring actions are qualities not shown in people from higher classes but among hard working individuals who are browbeaten by the uncaring factory owners such as mr_bounderby
these qualities appear repeatedly as stephen_blackpool work hard every day until he decides to leave town to save the name of his fellow workers and rachel supports stephen_blackpool through this while struggling to provide for herself as well
in contrast to these behaviours mr_bounderby refuses to recognise the difficulties faced by those in lower classes as seen by him completely casting aside stephen_blackpool request for help
other aristocratic characters simply carry out blatantly immoral actions such as tom_gradgrind throwing away his sister money falling into debt then robbing bank and even framing someone else for his actions
tom_gradgrind is also seen to be deceitful as he is able to keep his guilt hidden until the evidence points only toward him
on the contrary when the news comes out that stephen_blackpool had robbed the bank stephen_blackpool begins to head back to coketown to face his problems and clear his name
overall the stark difference in morality between characters of dissimilar social status suggests dickens idea that there is form of innate natural law that may remain unhampered in those leading less titled life
stephen_blackpool concept of right and wrong is untainted by the manufactured values of utilitarianism instilled into tom_gradgrind and mr_bounderby george bernard shaw was critical of the book message

however mr_thomas_gradgrind macaulay branded it sullen socialism on the grounds that dickens did not fully comprehend the politics of the time
george bernard shaw argued hard time to be novel of passionate revolt against the whole industrial order of the modern world
but he criticised the novel for failing to provide an accurate account of trade unionism of the time arguing that slackbridge the poisonous orator was a mere figment of middle class imagination
john ruskin declared hard time to be his favourite dickens work due to its exploration of important social question
believing that it was very different from dickens other novels shaw also said many readers find the change disappointing others find dickens worth reading almost for the first time
f leavis in the great tradition described the book as essentially moral fable and that of all dickens work it is the one that has all the strengths of his genius that of completely serious work of art
this however was view which he later revised in dickens the novelist which recognised that dickens strengths and artistry appeared fully in other work
walter allen characterised hard time as being an unsurpassed critique of industrial society which was later superseded by work of h lawrence
other writers have described the novel as being as k chesterton commented in his work appreciations and criticisms the harshest of his stories whereas george orwell praised the novel and dickens himself for generous anger
