in elizabeth rigby later elizabeth eastlake reviewing $jane_eyre$ in the quarterly review found it pre eminently an anti christian composition declaring we do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad and fostered chartism and rebellion at home is the same which has also written $jane_eyre$
literary critic jerome beaty felt that the close first person perspective leaves the reader too uncritically accepting of her worldview and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting $jane_eyre$ regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives are
the exact time setting of the novel is impossible to determine as several references in the text are contradictory is referred to in chapter as new publication but adèle mentions crossing the channel by steamship impossible before
