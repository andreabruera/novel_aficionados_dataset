i had the story bit by bit from various people and as generally happens in such cases each #time# it was a different story
if you know the post office you must have seen $ethan_frome$ drive up to it drop the reins on his hollow backed bay and drag himself across the brick pavement to the white colonnade and you must have asked who he was
it was there that several years ago i saw him for the first #time# and the sight pulled me up sharp
produced by charles aldarondo $ethan_frome$ by edith wharton $ethan_frome$ if you know $starkfield$ massachusetts you know the post office even then he was the most striking figure in $starkfield$ though he was but the ruin of a man
it was not so much his great height that marked him for the natives were easily singled out by their lank longitude from the stockier foreign breed it was the careless powerful look he had in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain
there was something bleak and unapproachable in his face and he was so stiffened and grizzled that i took him for an old man and was surprised to hear that he was not more than fifty two
i had this from $harmon_gow$ who had driven the stage from bettsbridge to $starkfield$ in pre trolley days and knew the chronicle of all the families on his #line#
he looked that way ever since he had his smash up and that twenty four years ago come next february $harmon_gow$ threw out between reminiscent pauses
i gathered from the same informant which besides drawing the red gash across $ethan_frome$ forehead had so shortened and warped his right side that it cost him a visible effort to take the few steps from his buggy to the post office window
he used to drive in from his farm every day at about noon and as that was my own #hour# for fetching my mail
i often passed him in the porch or stood beside him while we waited on the motions of the distributing #hand# behind the grating
i noticed that though he came so punctually he seldom received anything but a copy of the bettsbridge eagle which he put without a glance into his sagging pocket
at intervals however the post master would #hand# him an envelope addressed to mrs zenobia or mrs $zeena$ $ethan_frome$ and usually bearing conspicuously in the upper left #hand# corner the address of some manufacturer of patent medicine and the name of his specific
these documents my neighbour would also pocket without a glance as if too much used to them to wonder at their number and variety and would then turn away with a silent nod to the post master
every one in $starkfield$ knew him and gave him a greeting tempered to his own grave mien but his taciturnity was respected and it was only on rare occasions that one of the older men of the place detained him for a #word#
when this happened he would listen quietly his blue #eye# on the speaker face and answer in so low a tone that his #word# never reached me then he would climb stiffly into his buggy gather up the reins in his left #hand# and drive slowly away in the direction of his farm
i questioned $harmon_gow$ looking after $ethan_frome$ retreating figure and thinking how gallantly his lean brown #head# with its shock of #light# hair must have sat on his strong shoulders before they were bent out of shape
the smash up it was it was a pretty bad smash up wust kind my informant assented more enough to kill most men
at the moment $ethan_frome$ after climbing to his seat had leaned over to assure himself of the security of a wooden box also with a druggist label on it which he had placed in the back of the buggy and i saw his face as it probably looked when he thought himself alone
but the fromes are tough $ethan_frome$ ll likely touch a hundred good god i exclaimed that man touch a hundred
$harmon_gow$ drew a slab of tobacco from his pocket cut off a wedge and pressed it into the leather pouch of his cheek
he looks as if he was dead and in hell now guess he been in $starkfield$ too many winters most of the smart ones get away
why didnt he somebody had to stay and care for the folks there warnt ever anybody but $ethan_frome$ fust his father then his mother then his wife
and then the smash up $harmon_gow$ chuckled sardonically that so he had to stay then i see and since then they ve had to care for him
$harmon_gow$ thoughtfully passed his tobacco to the other cheek oh as to that i guess it always $ethan_frome$ done the caring
though $harmon_gow$ developed the tale as far as his mental and moral reach permitted there were perceptible gaps between his facts and i had the sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps
but one phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which i grouped my subsequent inferences guess he been in $starkfield$ too many winters
yet i had come in the degenerate day of trolley bicycle and rural delivery when communication was easy between the scattered mountain villages and the bigger towns in the valleys such as bettsbridge and shadd falls had libraries theatres and m a halls to which the youth of the hills could descend for recreation
but when winter shut down on $starkfield$ and the village lay under a sheet of snow perpetually renewed from the pale skies i began to see what life there or rather its negation must have been in $ethan_frome$ young manhood
i had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big power house at corbury junction and a long drawn carpenters strike had so delayed the work that i found myself anchored at $starkfield$ the nearest habitable spot for the best part of the winter
i chafed at first and then under the hypnotising effect of routine gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life
during the early part of my stay i had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community
day by day after the december snows were over a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of #light# and air on the white landscape which gave them back in an intenser glitter
one would have supposed that such an atmosphere must quicken the emotions as well as the blood but it seemed to produce no change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of $starkfield$
when i had been there a little longer and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold when the storms of february had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild cavalry of march winds had charged down to their support i began to understand why $starkfield$ emerged from its six months siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter
twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer and the enemy in command of almost all the #line# of access between the beleaguered villages and considering these things i felt the sinister force of $harmon_gow$ phrase most of the smart ones get away
but if that were the case how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like $ethan_frome$
before my own #time# there was up i had learned to know what that meant during my stay at $starkfield$ i lodged with a middle aged widow colloquially known as $mrs_ned_hale$
$mrs_ned_hale$ father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation and lawyer varnum house where my landlady still lived with her mother was the most considerable mansion in the village
it stood at one end of the main street its classic portico and small paned windows looking down a flagged path between norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the congregational church
it was clear that the varnum fortunes were at the ebb but the two women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity and $mrs_ned_hale$ in particular had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping with her pale old fashioned house
in the best parlour with its black horse hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling carcel lamp i listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the $starkfield$ chronicle
it was not that $mrs_ned_hale$ felt or affected any social superiority to the people about her it was only that the accident of a finer sensibility and a little more education had put just enough distance between herself and her neighbours to enable her to judge them with detachment
she was not unwilling to exercise this faculty and i had great hopes of getting from her the missing facts of $ethan_frome$ story or rather such a key to his character as should co ordinate the facts i knew
her mind was a store house of innocuous anecdote and any question about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail but on the subject of $ethan_frome$ i found her unexpectedly reticent
there was no hint of disapproval in her reserve i merely felt in her an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs a low yes i knew them both
it was awful seeming to be the utmost concession that her distress could make to my curiosity so marked was the change in her manner
such depths of sad initiation did it imply that with some doubts as to my delicacy i put the case anew to my village oracle $harmon_gow$ but got for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt
ruth varnum was always as nervous as a rat and come to think of it she was the first one to see em after they was picked up
it happened right below lawyer varnum down at the bend of the corbury road just round about the #time# that ruth got engaged to $mrs_ned_hale$
the young folks was all friends and i guess she just cant bear to talk about it she had troubles enough of her own
all the dwellers in $starkfield$ as in more notable communities had had troubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to those of their neighbours and though all conceded that $ethan_frome$ had been beyond the common measure no one gave me an explanation of the look in his face which as i persisted in thinking neither poverty nor physical suffering could have put there
nevertheless i might have contented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had it not been for the provocation of $mrs_ned_hale$ silence and a little later for the accident of personal contact with the man
on my arrival at $starkfield$ $denis_eady$ the rich irish grocer who was the proprietor of $starkfield$ nearest approach to a livery stable had entered into an agreement to send me over daily to corbury flats where i had to pick up my train for the junction
the illness spread to the other $starkfield$ stables and for a day or two i was put to it to find a means of transport
then $harmon_gow$ suggested that $ethan_frome$ bay was still on his legs and that his owner might be glad to drive me over
but about the middle of the winter $denis_eady$ horses fell ill of a local epidemic i stared at the suggestion
$ethan_frome$ but i ve never even spoken to him why on earth should he put himself out for me
$harmon_gow$ answer surprised me still more i dont know as he would but i know he wouldnt be sorry to earn a dollar
i had been told that $ethan_frome$ was poor and that the saw mill and the arid acres of his farm yielded scarcely enough to keep his household through the winter but i had not supposed him to be in such want as $harmon_gow$ #word# implied and i expressed my wonder
when a man been setting round like a hulk for twenty years or more seeing things that want doing it eats inter him and he loses his grit
that $ethan_frome$ farm was always bout as bare a milkpan when the cat been round and you know what one of them old water mills is wuth nowadays
when $ethan_frome$ could sweat over em both from sunup to dark he kinder choked a living out of em but his folks ate up most everything even then and i dont see how he makes out now
fust his father got a kick out haying and went soft in the brain and gave away money like bible texts afore he died
then his mother got queer and dragged along for years as weak as a baby and his wife $zeena$ she always been the greatest #hand# at doctoring in the county
well matters aint gone any too well with him $harmon_gow$ said sickness and trouble that what $ethan_frome$ had his plate full up with ever since the very first helping
the next morning when i looked out i saw the hollow backed bay between the varnum spruces and $ethan_frome$ throwing back his worn bearskin made room for me in the sleigh at his side
after that for a week he drove me over every morning to corbury flats and on my return in the afternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy #night# to $starkfield$
the distance each way was barely three miles but the old bay pace was slow and even with firm snow under the runners we were nearly an #hour# on the way
$ethan_frome$ drove in silence the reins loosely held in his left #hand# his brown seamed profile under the helmet like peak of the cap relieved against the banks of snow like the bronze image of a hero
he never turned his face to mine or answered except in monosyllables the questions i put or such slight pleasantries as i ventured
he seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape an incarnation of its frozen woe with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface but there was nothing unfriendly in his silence
i simply felt that he lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access and i had the sense that his loneliness was not merely the result of his personal plight tragic as i guessed that to be but had in it as $harmon_gow$ had hinted the profound accumulated cold of many $starkfield$ winters
only once or twice was the distance between us bridged for a moment and the glimpses thus gained confirmed my desire to know more
once i happened to speak of an engineering job i had been on the previous year in florida and of the contrast between the winter landscape about us and that in which i had found myself the year before and to my surprise $ethan_frome$ said suddenly yes i was down there once and for a good while afterward i could call up the sight of it in winter
he said no more and i had to guess the rest from the inflection of his voice and his sharp relapse into silence
another day on getting into my train at the flats i missed a volume of popular science i think it was on some recent discoveries in bio chemistry which i had carried with me to read on the way
i thought no more about it till i got into the sleigh again that evening and saw the book in $ethan_frome$ #hand#
i put the volume into my pocket and we dropped back into our usual silence but as we began to crawl up the long hill from corbury flats to the $starkfield$ ridge i became aware in the dusk that he had turned his face to mine
but now it all snowed under i found it after you were gone he said there are things in that book that i didnt know the first #word# about he said
i wondered less at his #word# than at the queer note of resentment in his voice he was evidently surprised and slightly aggrieved at his own ignorance
there are one or two rather new things in the book there have been some big strides lately in that particular #line# of research
i waited a moment for an answer that did not come then i said if you like to look the book through i be glad to leave it with you
does that sort of thing interest you i asked it used to he hesitated and i had the impression that he felt himself about to yield to a stealing tide of inertia
then thank you i ll take it he answered shortly i hoped that this incident might set up some more direct communication between us
$ethan_frome$ was so simple and straightforward that i was sure his curiosity about the book was based on a genuine interest in its subject
such tastes and acquirements in a man of his condition made the contrast more poignant between his outer situation and his inner needs and i hoped that the chance of giving expression to the latter might at least unseal his lips
but something in his past history or in his present way of living had apparently driven him too deeply into himself for any casual impulse to draw him back to his kind
at our next meeting he made no allusion to the book and our intercourse seemed fated to remain as negative and one sided as if there had been no break in his reserve
$ethan_frome$ had been driving me over to the flats for about a week when one morning i looked out of my window into a thick snow fall
the height of the white waves massed against the garden fence and along the wall of the church showed that the storm must have been going on all #night# and that the drifts were likely to be heavy in the open
i thought it probable that my train would be delayed but i had to be at the power house for an #hour# or two that afternoon and i decided if $ethan_frome$ turned up to push through to the flats and wait there till my train came in
he was not the kind of man to be turned from his business by any commotion of the elements and at the appointed #hour# his sleigh glided up through the snow like a stage apparition behind thickening veils of gauze
i was getting to know him too well to express either wonder or gratitude at his keeping his appointment but i exclaimed in surprise as i saw him turn his horse in a direction opposite to that of the corbury road
the railroad blocked by a freight train that got stuck in a drift below the flats he explained as we jogged off into the stinging whiteness
i dont know why i put it in the conditional however for i never doubted that $ethan_frome$ would appear
but look here where are you taking me then straight to the junction by the shortest way he answered pointing up school house hill with his whip
to the junction in this storm why it a good ten miles the bay ll do it if you give him #time#
you said you had some business there this afternoon i ll see you get there he said it so quietly that i could only answer you re doing me the biggest kind of a favour
abreast of the schoolhouse the road forked and we dipped down a lane to the left between hemlock boughs bent inward to their trunks by the weight of the snow
i had often walked that way on sundays and knew that the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom of the hill was that of $ethan_frome$ saw mill
it looked exanimate enough with its idle wheel looming above the black stream dashed with yellow white spume and its cluster of sheds sagging under their white load
$ethan_frome$ did not even turn his #head# as we drove by and still in silence we began to mount the next slope
about a mile farther on a road i had never travelled we came to an orchard of starved apple trees writhing over a hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snow like animals pushing out their noses to breathe
beyond the orchard lay a field or two their boundaries lost under drifts and above the fields huddled against the white immensities of land and sky one of those lonely new england farm houses that make the landscape lonelier
that my place said $ethan_frome$ with a sideway jerk of his lame elbow and in the distress and oppression of the scene i did not know what to answer
the snow had ceased and a flash of watery sunlight exposed the house on the slope above us in all its plaintive ugliness
the black wraith of a deciduous creeper flapped from the porch and the thin wooden walls under their worn coat of paint seemed to shiver in the wind that had risen with the ceasing of the snow
the house was bigger in my father #time# i had to take down the a while back $ethan_frome$ continued checking with a twitch of the left rein the bay evident intention of turning in through the broken down gate
i saw then that the unusually forlorn and stunted look of the house was partly due to the loss of what is known in new england as the that long deep roofed adjunct usually built at right angles to the main house and connecting it by way of storerooms and tool house with the wood shed and cow barn
whether because of its symbolic sense the image it presents of a life linked with the soil and enclosing in itself the chief sources of warmth and nourishment or whether merely because of the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harsh climate to get to their morning work without facing the weather it is certain that the rather than the house itself seems to be the centre the actual hearth stone of the new england farm
perhaps this connection of ideas which had often occurred to me in my rambles about $starkfield$ caused me to hear a wistful note in $ethan_frome$ #word# and to see in the diminished dwelling the image of his own shrunken body
we re kinder side tracked here now he added but there was considerable passing before the railroad was carried through to the flats
he roused the lagging bay with another twitch then as if the mere sight of the house had let me too deeply into his confidence for any farther pretence of reserve he went on slowly i ve always set down the worst of mother trouble to that
when she got the rheumatism so bad she couldnt move around she used to sit up there and watch the road by the #hour# and one year when they was six months mending the bettsbridge pike after the floods and $harmon_gow$ had to bring his stage round this way
that all right he rejoined she picked up so that she used to get down to the gate most days to see him
but after the trains begun running nobody ever come by here to speak of and mother never could get it through her #head# what had happened and it preyed on her right along till she died
as we turned into the corbury road the snow began to fall again cutting off our last glimpse of the house and $ethan_frome$ silence fell with it letting down between us the old veil of reticence
instead it sprang up to a gale which now and then from a tattered sky flung pale sweeps of sunlight over a landscape chaotically tossed
but the bay was as good as $ethan_frome$ #word# and we pushed on to the junction through the wild white scene
in the afternoon the storm held off and the clearness in the west seemed to my inexperienced #eye# the pledge of a fair evening
i finished my business as quickly as possible and we set out for $starkfield$ with a good chance of getting there for supper
but at sunset the clouds gathered again bringing an earlier #night# and the snow began to fall straight and steadily from a sky without wind in a soft universal diffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies of the morning
it seemed to be a part of the thickening darkness to be the winter #night# itself descending on us layer by layer
the small ray of $ethan_frome$ lantern was soon lost in this smothering medium in which even his sense of direction and the bay homing instinct finally ceased to serve us
two or three #time# some ghostly landmark sprang up to warn us that we were astray and then was sucked back into the mist and when we finally regained our road the old horse began to show signs of exhaustion
i felt myself to blame for having accepted $ethan_frome$ offer and after a short discussion i persuaded him to let me get out of the sleigh and walk along through the snow at the bay side
in this way we struggled on for another mile or two and at last reached a point where $ethan_frome$ peering into what seemed to me formless #night# said that my gate down yonder
this #time# the wind did not cease with the return of the snow the last stretch had been the hardest part of the way
the bitter cold and the heavy going had nearly knocked the wind out of me and i could feel the horse side ticking like a clock under my #hand#
look here $ethan_frome$ i began there no earthly use in your going any farther but he interrupted me nor you neither
i understood that he was offering me a #night# shelter at the farm and without answering i turned into the gate at his side and followed him to the barn where i helped him to unharness and bed down the tired horse
when this was done he unhooked the lantern from the sleigh stepped out again into the #night# and called to me over his shoulder
there been about enough of this for anybody this way far off above us a square of #light# trembled through the screen of snow
staggering along in $ethan_frome$ wake i floundered toward it and in the darkness almost fell into one of the deep drifts against the front of the house
$ethan_frome$ scrambled up the slippery steps of the porch digging a way through the snow with his heavily booted foot then he lifted his lantern found the latch and led the way into the house
on our right a #line# of #light# marked the door of the room which had sent its ray across the #night# and behind the door i heard a woman voice droning querulously
$ethan_frome$ stamped on the worn oil cloth to shake the snow from his boots and set down his lantern on a kitchen chair which was the only piece of furniture in the hall
i went after him into a low unlit passage at the back of which a ladder like staircase rose into obscurity then he opened the door
it was that #night# that i found the clue to $ethan_frome$ and began to put together this vision of his story
come in he said and as he spoke the droning voice grew still i the village lay under two feet of snow with drifts at the windy corners
the moon had set but the #night# was so transparent that the white house fronts between the elms looked gray against the snow clumps of bushes made black stains on it and the basement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow #light# far across the endless undulations
young $ethan_frome$ walked at a quick pace along the deserted street past the bank and michael $denis_eady$ new brick store and lawyer varnum house with the two black norway spruces at the gate
opposite the varnum gate where the road fell away toward the corbury valley the church reared its slim white steeple and narrow peristyle
as the young man walked toward it the upper windows drew a black arcade along the side wall of the building but from the lower openings on the side where the ground sloped steeply down to the corbury road the #light# shot its long bars illuminating many fresh furrows in the track leading to the basement door and showing under an adjoining shed a #line# of sleighs with heavily blanketed horses
in a sky of iron the points of the dipper hung like icicles and orion flashed his cold fires the #night# was perfectly still and the air so dry and pure that it gave little sensation of cold
the effect produced on $ethan_frome$ was rather of a complete absence of atmosphere as though nothing less tenuous than ether intervened between the white earth under his feet and the metallic dome overhead
four or five years earlier he had taken a year course at a technological college at worcester and dabbled in the laboratory with a friendly professor of physics and the images supplied by that experience still cropped up at unexpected moments through the totally different associations of thought in which he had since been living
his father death and the misfortunes following it had put a premature end to $ethan_frome$ studies but though they had not gone far enough to be of much practical use they had fed his fancy and made him aware of huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things
as he strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed in his brain and mingled with the bodily flush produced by his sharp tramp
it like being in an exhausted receiver he thought at the end of the village he paused before the darkened front of the church
the pitch of the corbury road below lawyer varnum spruces was the favourite coasting ground of $starkfield$ and on clear evenings the church corner rang till late with the shouts of the coasters but to #night# not a sled darkened the whiteness of the long declivity
the hush of midnight lay on the village and all its waking life was gathered behind the church windows from which strains of dance music flowed with the broad bands of yellow #light#
he stood there a moment breathing quickly and looking up and down the street in which not another figure moved the young man skirting the side of the building went down the slope toward the basement door
to keep out of range of the revealing rays from within he made a circuit through the untrodden snow and gradually approached the farther angle of the basement wall
thence still hugging the shadow he edged his way cautiously forward to the nearest window holding back his straight spare body and craning his neck till he got a glimpse of the room
seen thus from the pure and frosty darkness in which he stood it seemed to be seething in a mist of heat
the metal reflectors of the gas jets sent crude waves of #light# against the whitewashed walls and the iron flanks of the stove at the end of the hall looked as though they were heaving with volcanic fires
down the side wall facing the window stood a row of kitchen chairs from which the older women had just risen
by this #time# the music had stopped and the musicians a fiddler and the young lady who played the harmonium on sundays were hastily refreshing themselves at one corner of the supper table which aligned its devastated pie dishes and ice cream saucers on the platform at the end of the hall
the guests were preparing to leave and the tide had already set toward the passage where coats and wraps were hung when a young man with a sprightly foot and a shock of black hair shot into the middle of the floor and clapped his #hand#
the musicians hurried to their instruments the dancers some already half muffled for departure fell into #line# down each side of the room the older spectators slipped back to their chairs and the lively young man after diving about here and there in the throng drew forth a girl who had already wound a cherry coloured fascinator about her #head# and leading her up to the end of the floor whirled her down its length to the bounding tune of a virginia reel
he had been straining for a glimpse of the dark #head# under the cherry coloured scarf and it vexed him that another #eye# should have been quicker than his
the leader of the reel who looked as if he had irish blood in his veins danced well and his partner caught his fire
as she passed down the #line# her #light# figure swinging from #hand# to #hand# in circles of increasing swiftness the scarf flew off her #head# and stood out behind her shoulders and $ethan_frome$ at each turn caught sight of her laughing panting lips the cloud of dark hair about her forehead and the dark #eye# which seemed the only fixed points in a maze of flying #line#
the dancers were going faster and faster and the musicians to keep up with them belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing their mounts on the home stretch yet it seemed to the young man at the window that the reel would never end
now and then he turned his #eye# from the girl face to that of her partner which in the exhilaration of the dance had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership
$denis_eady$ was the son of michael $denis_eady$ the ambitious irish grocer whose suppleness and effrontery had given $starkfield$ its first notion of smart business methods and whose new brick store testified to the success of the attempt
his son seemed likely to follow in his steps and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the $starkfield$ maidenhood
the floor was thronged with girls and young men the signal took instant effect $ethan_frome$ heart was beating fast hitherto $ethan_frome$ had been content to think him a mean fellow but now he positively invited a horse whipping
it was strange that the girl did not seem aware of it that she could lift her rapt face to her dancer and drop her #hand# into his without appearing to feel the offence of his look and touch
$ethan_frome$ was in the habit of walking into $starkfield$ to fetch home his wife cousin $mattie_silver$ on the rare evenings when some chance of amusement drew her to the village
it was his wife who had suggested when the girl came to live with them that such opportunities should be put in her way
$mattie_silver$ came from stamford and when she entered the fromes household to act as her cousin $zeena$ aid it was thought best as she came without pay not to let her feel too sharp a contrast between the life she had left and the isolation of a $starkfield$ farm
when his wife first proposed that they should give $mattie_silver$ an occasional evening out he had inwardly demurred at having to do the extra two miles to the village and back after his hard day on the farm but not long afterward he had reached the point of wishing that $starkfield$ might give all its #night# to revelry
$mattie_silver$ had lived under his roof for a year and from early morning till they met at supper he had frequent chances of seeing her but no moments in her company were comparable to those when her arm in his and her #light# step flying to keep #time# with his long stride they walked back through the #night# to the farm
he had taken to the girl from the first day when he had driven over to the flats to meet her and she had smiled and waved to him from the train crying out
you must be $ethan_frome$ as she jumped down with her bundles while he reflected looking over her slight person she dont look much on housework but she aint a fretter anyhow
but for this as $ethan_frome$ sardonically reflected it would hardly have occurred to $zeena$ to take any thought for the girl amusement
but it was not only that the coming to his house of a bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a cold hearth
she had an #eye# to see and an ear to hear he could show her things and tell her things and taste the bliss of feeling that all he imparted left long reverberations and echoes he could wake at will
the girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he had thought her it was during their #night# walks back to the farm that he felt most intensely the sweetness of this communion
his unfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in his unhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him with a deep and powerful persuasion
he had always been more sensitive than the people about him to the appeal of natural beauty but hitherto the emotion had remained in him as a silent ache veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it
he did not even know whether any one else in the world felt as he did or whether he was the sole victim of this mournful privilege
then he learned that one other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder that at his side living under his roof and eating his bread was a creature to whom he could say that orion down yonder the big fellow to the right is aldebaran and the bunch of little ones like bees swarming they re the pleiades or whom he could hold entranced before a ledge of granite thrusting up through the fern while he unrolled the huge panorama of the ice age and the long dim stretches of succeeding #time#
the fact that admiration for his learning mingled with $mattie_silver$ wonder at what he taught was not the least part of his pleasure
and there were other sensations less definable but more exquisite which drew them together with a shock of silent joy the cold red of sunset behind winter hills the flight of cloud flocks over slopes of golden stubble or the intensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow
it seemed to $ethan_frome$ that the art of definition could go no farther and that #word# had at last been found to utter his secret soul
when she said to him once it looks just as if it was painted as he stood in the darkness outside the church these memories came back with the poignancy of vanished things
watching $mattie_silver$ whirl down the floor from #hand# to #hand# he wondered how he could ever have thought that his dull talk interested her
the face she lifted to her dancers was the same which when she saw him always looked like a window that has caught the sunset
he even noticed two or three gestures which in his fatuity he had thought she kept for him a way of throwing her #head# back when she was amused as if to taste her laugh before she let it out and a trick of sinking her lids slowly when anything charmed or moved her
to him who was never gay but in her presence her gaiety seemed plain proof of indifference the sight made him unhappy and his unhappiness roused his latent fears
his wife had never shown any jealousy of $mattie_silver$ but of late she had grumbled increasingly over the house work and found oblique ways of attracting attention to the girl inefficiency
$zeena$ had always been what $starkfield$ called sickly and $ethan_frome$ had to admit that if she were as ailing as she believed she needed the help of a stronger arm than the one which lay so lightly in his during the #night# walks to the farm
$mattie_silver$ had no natural turn for housekeeping and her training had done nothing to remedy the defect she was quick to learn but forgetful and dreamy and not disposed to take the matter seriously
$ethan_frome$ had an idea that if she were to marry a man she was fond of the dormant instinct would wake and her pies and biscuits become the pride of the county but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her
at first she was so awkward that he could not help laughing at her but she laughed with him and that made them better friends
he did his best to supplement her unskilled efforts getting up earlier than usual to #light# the kitchen fire carrying in the wood overnight and neglecting the mill for the farm that he might help her about the house during the day
he even crept down on saturday #night# to scrub the kitchen floor after the women had gone to bed and $zeena$ one day had surprised him at the churn and had turned away silently with one of her queer looks
one cold winter morning as he dressed in the dark his candle flickering in the draught of the ill fitting window he had heard her speak from the bed behind him
of late there had been other signs of her disfavour as intangible but more disquieting the doctor dont want i should be left without anybody to do for me she said in her flat whine
he had supposed her to be asleep and the sound of her voice had startled him though she was given to abrupt explosions of speech after long intervals of secretive silence
he turned and looked at her where she lay indistinctly outlined under the dark calico quilt her high boned face taking a grayish tinge from the whiteness of the pillow
nobody to do for you he repeated if you say you cant afford a hired girl when $mattie_silver$ goes
$ethan_frome$ turned away again and taking up his razor stooped to catch the reflection of his stretched cheek in the blotched looking glass above the wash stand
why on earth should $mattie_silver$ go well when she gets married i mean his wife drawl came from behind him
i wouldnt ever have it said that i stood in the way of a poor girl like $mattie_silver$ marrying a smart fellow like $denis_eady$ $zeena$ answered in a tone of plaintive self effacement
oh she never leave us as long as you needed her he returned scraping hard at his chin $ethan_frome$ glaring at his face in the glass threw his #head# back to draw the razor from ear to chin
his #hand# was steady but the attitude was an excuse for not making an immediate reply and the doctor dont want i should be left without anybody $zeena$ continued
he wanted i should speak to you about a girl he heard about that might come $ethan_frome$ laid down the razor and straightened himself with a laugh
$denis_eady$ if that all i guess there no such hurry to look round for a girl
well i like to talk to you about it said $zeena$ obstinately he was getting into his clothes in fumbling haste
but i havent got the #time# now i late as it is he returned holding his old silver turnip watch to the candle
$zeena$ apparently accepting this as final lay watching him in silence while he pulled his suspenders over his shoulders and jerked his arms into his coat but as he went toward the door she said suddenly and incisively i guess you re always late now you shave every morning
it was a fact that since $mattie_silver$ coming he had taken to shaving every day but his wife always seemed to be asleep when he left her side in the winter darkness and he had stupidly assumed that she would not notice any change in his appearance
once or twice in the past he had been faintly disquieted by zenobia way of letting things happen without seeming to remark them and then weeks afterward in a casual phrase revealing that she had all along taken her notes and drawn her inferences
all right that thrust had frightened him more than any vague insinuations about $denis_eady$ of late however there had been no room in his thoughts for such vague apprehensions
all his life was lived in the sight and sound of $mattie_silver$ and he could no longer conceive of its being otherwise
but now as he stood outside the church and saw $mattie_silver$ spinning down the floor with $denis_eady$ a throng of disregarded hints and menaces wove their cloud about his brain ii as the dancers poured out of the hall $ethan_frome$ drawing back behind the projecting storm door watched the segregation of the grotesquely muffled groups in which a moving lantern ray now and then lit up a face flushed with food and dancing
the villagers being afoot were the first to climb the slope to the main street while the country neighbours packed themselves more slowly into the sleighs under the shed
aint you riding $mattie_silver$ a woman voice called back from the throng about the shed and $ethan_frome$ heart gave a jump
from where he stood he could not see the persons coming out of the hall till they had advanced a few steps beyond the wooden sides of the storm door but through its cracks he heard a clear voice answer
$zeena$ herself from an oppressive reality had faded into an insubstantial shade mercy no not on such a #night#
in another moment she would step forth into the #night# and his #eye# accustomed to the obscurity would discern her as clearly as though she stood in daylight
a wave of shyness pulled him back into the dark angle of the wall and he stood there in silence instead of making his presence known to her
it had been one of the wonders of their intercourse that from the first she the quicker finer more expressive instead of crushing him by the contrast had given him something of her own ease and freedom but now he felt as heavy and loutish as in his student days when he had tried to jolly the worcester girls at a picnic
she was there then close to him only a thin board between he hung back and she came out alone and paused within a few yards of him
she was almost the last to leave the hall and she stood looking uncertainly about her as if wondering why he did not show himself
then a man figure approached coming so close to her that under their formless wrappings they seemed merged in one dim outline
gentleman friend gone back on you say $matt$ that tough no i wouldnt be mean enough to tell the other girls
i aint as low down as that how $ethan_frome$ hated his cheap banter but look at here aint it lucky
i got the old man cutter down there waiting for us $ethan_frome$ heard the girl voice gaily incredulous what on earth your father cutter doin down there
i kinder knew i want to take a ride to #night# $denis_eady$ in his triumph tried to put a sentimental note into his bragging voice
why waiting for me to take a ride i got the roan colt too the girl seemed to waver and $ethan_frome$ saw her twirl the end of her scarf irresolutely about her fingers
not for the world would he have made a sign to her though it seemed to him that his life hung on her next gesture
hold on a minute while i unhitch the colt $denis_eady$ called to her springing toward the shed she stood perfectly still looking after him in an attitude of tranquil expectancy torturing to the hidden watcher
$ethan_frome$ noticed that she no longer turned her #head# from side to side as though peering through the #night# for another figure
she let $denis_eady$ lead out the horse climb into the cutter and fling back the bearskin to make room for her at his side then with a swift motion of flight she turned about and darted up the slope toward the front of the church
good bye hope you ll have a lovely ride she called back to him over her shoulder $denis_eady$ laughed and gave the horse a cut that brought him quickly abreast of her retreating figure
come along get in quick it as slippery as thunder on this turn he cried leaning over to reach out a #hand# to her
by this #time# they had passed beyond $ethan_frome$ earshot and he could only follow the shadowy pantomime of their silhouettes as they continued to move along the crest of the slope above him
he saw $denis_eady$ after a moment jump from the cutter and go toward the girl with the reins over one arm
the other he tried to slip through hers but she eluded him nimbly and $ethan_frome$ heart which had swung out over a black void trembled back to safety
a moment later he heard the jingle of departing sleigh bells and discerned a figure advancing alone toward the empty expanse of snow before the church
she laughed back at him good #night# i not getting in in the black shade of the varnum spruces he caught up with her and she turned with a quick
oh think i forgotten you $matt$ he asked with sheepish glee she answered seriously i thought maybe you couldnt come back for me
couldnt what on earth could stop me i knew $zeena$ wasnt feeling any too good to day oh she in bed long ago
he paused a question struggling in him then you meant to walk home all alone oh i aint afraid
they stood together in the gloom of the spruces an empty world glimmering about them wide and grey under the stars
she laughed he brought his question out if you thought i hadnt come why didnt you ride back with $denis_eady$
why where were you how did you know i never saw you her wonder and his laughter ran together like spring rills in a thaw
$ethan_frome$ had the sense of having done something arch and ingenious to prolong the effect he groped for a dazzling phrase and brought out in a growl of rapture come along
he slipped an arm through hers as $denis_eady$ had done and fancied it was faintly pressed against her side but neither of them moved
it was so dark under the spruces that he could barely see the shape of her #head# beside his shoulder he longed to stoop his cheek and rub it against her scarf
he would have liked to stand there with her all #night# in the blackness she moved forward a step or two and then paused again above the dip of the corbury road
its icy slope scored by innumerable runners looked like a mirror scratched by travellers at an inn there was a whole lot of them coasting before the moon set she said
would you like to come in and coast with them some #night# he asked oh would you $ethan_frome$
it would be lovely we ll come to morrow if there a moon she lingered pressing closer to his side $mrs_ned_hale$ and ruth varnum came just as near running into the big elm at the bottom
we were all sure they were killed her shiver ran down his arm wouldnt it have been too awful
they re so happy oh $mrs_ned_hale$ aint much at steering i guess i can take you down all right he said disdainfully
he was aware that he was talking big like $denis_eady$ but his reaction of joy had unsteadied him and the inflection with which she had said of the engaged couple they re so happy
made the #word# sound as if she had been thinking of herself and him the elm is dangerous though
it ought to be cut down she insisted would you be afraid of it with me i told you i aint the kind to be afraid
she tossed back almost indifferently and suddenly she began to walk on with a rapid step these alterations of mood were the despair and joy of $ethan_frome$
the fact that he had no right to show his feelings and thus provoke the expression of hers made him attach a fantastic importance to every change in her look and tone
the motions of her mind were as incalculable as the flit of a bird in the branches now he thought she understood him and feared now he was sure she did not and despaired
to #night# the pressure of accumulated misgivings sent the scale drooping toward despair and her indifference was the more chilling after the flush of joy into which she had plunged him by dismissing $denis_eady$
he mounted school house hill at her side and walked on in silence till they reached the lane leading to the saw mill then the need of some definite assurance grew too strong for him
you have found me right off if you hadnt gone back to have that last reel with $denis_eady$ he brought out awkwardly
he could not pronounce the name without a stiffening of the muscles of his throat why $ethan_frome$ how could i tell you were there
i suppose what folks say is true he jerked out at her instead of answering she stopped short and he felt in the darkness that her face was lifted quickly to his
why what do folks say it natural enough you should be leaving us he floundered on following his thought
she mocked back at him then with a sudden drop of her sweet treble you mean that $zeena$ aint suited with me any more
is that what they say she faltered their arms had slipped apart and they stood motionless each seeking to distinguish the other face
i know i aint anything like as smart as i ought to be she went on while he vainly struggled for expression
there lots of things a hired girl could do that come awkward to me still and i havent got much strength in my arms
but if she only tell me i try you know she hardly ever says anything and sometimes i can see she aint suited and yet i dont know why
she turned on him with a sudden flash of indignation you ought to tell me $ethan_frome$ you ought to
unless you want me to go too unless he wanted her to go too the cry was balm to his raw wound
the iron heavens seemed to melt and rain down sweetness again he struggled for the all expressive #word# and again his arm in hers found only a deep come along
they walked on in silence through the blackness of the hemlock shaded lane where $ethan_frome$ sawmill gloomed through the #night# and out again into the comparative clearness of the fields
on the farther side of the hemlock belt the open country rolled away before them grey and lonely under the stars
sometimes their way led them under the shade of an overhanging bank or through the thin obscurity of a clump of leafless trees
here and there a farmhouse stood far back among the fields mute and cold as a grave stone the #night# was so still that they heard the frozen snow crackle under their feet
the crash of a loaded branch falling far off in the woods reverberated like a musket shot and once a fox barked and $mattie_silver$ shrank closer to $ethan_frome$ and quickened her steps
at length they sighted the group of larches at $ethan_frome$ gate and as they drew near it the sense that the walk was over brought back his #word#
then you dont want to leave us $matt$ he had to stoop his #head# to catch her stifled whisper where i go if i did
he forgot what else he had meant to say and pressed her against him so closely that he seemed to feel her warmth in his veins
the answer sent a pang through him but the tone suffused him with joy you aint crying are you $matt$
they turned in at the gate and passed under the shaded knoll where enclosed in a low fence the $ethan_frome$ grave stones slanted at crazy angles through the snow
no of course i not she quavered $ethan_frome$ looked at them curiously for years that quiet company had mocked his restlessness his desire for change and freedom
seemed to be written on every headstone and whenever he went in or out of his gate he thought with a shiver i shall just go on living here till i join them
but now all desire for change had vanished and the sight of the little enclosure gave him a warm sense of continuance and stability
i guess we ll never let you go $matt$ he whispered as though even the dead lovers once must conspire with him to keep her and brushing by the graves he thought we ll always go on living here together and some day she ll lie there beside me
we never got away how should you he let the vision possess him as they climbed the hill to the house
he was never so happy with her as when he abandoned himself to these dreams half way up the slope $mattie_silver$ stumbled against some unseen obstruction and clutched his sleeve to steady herself
the wave of warmth that went through him was like the prolongation of his vision for the first #time# he stole his arm about her and she did not resist
$zeena$ always went to bed as soon as she had had her supper and the shutterless windows of the house were dark
a dead cucumber vine dangled from the porch like the crape streamer tied to the door for a death and the thought flashed through $ethan_frome$ brain
if it was there for $zeena$ then he had a distinct sight of his wife lying in their bedroom asleep her mouth slightly open her false teeth in a tumbler by the bed
they walked on as if they were floating on a summer stream they walked around to the back of the house between the rigid gooseberry bushes
it was $zeena$ habit when they came back late from the village to leave the key of the kitchen door under the mat
$ethan_frome$ stood before the door his #head# heavy with dreams his arm still about $mattie_silver$ $matt$ he began not knowing what he meant to say
she slipped out of his hold without speaking and he stooped down and felt for the key it not there he said straightening himself with a start
maybe she forgotten it $mattie_silver$ said in a tremulous whisper but both of them knew that it was not like $zeena$ to forget
they strained their #eye# at each other through the icy darkness such a thing had never happened before it might have fallen off into the snow $mattie_silver$ continued after a pause during which they had stood intently listening
it must have been pushed off then he rejoined in the same tone another wild thought tore through him what if tramps had been there what if
again he listened fancying he heard a distant sound in the house then he felt in his pocket for a match and kneeling down passed its #light# slowly over the rough edges of snow about the doorstep
he was still kneeling when his #eye# on a level with the lower panel of the door caught a faint ray beneath it
who could be stirring in that silent house he heard a step on the stairs and again for an instant the thought of tramps tore through him
against the dark background of the kitchen she stood up tall and angular one #hand# drawing a quilted counterpane to her flat breast while the other held a lamp
the #light# on a level with her chin drew out of the darkness her puckered throat and the projecting wrist of the #hand# that clutched the quilt and deepened fantastically the hollows and prominences of her high boned face under its ring of crimping pins
to $ethan_frome$ still in the rosy haze of his #hour# with $mattie_silver$ the sight came with the intense precision of the last dream before waking
then the door opened and he saw his wife he felt as if he had never before known what his wife looked like
she drew aside without speaking and $mattie_silver$ and $ethan_frome$ passed into the kitchen which had the deadly chill of a vault after the dry cold of the #night#
guess you forgot about us $zeena$ $ethan_frome$ joked stamping the snow from his boots no i just felt so mean i couldnt sleep
$mattie_silver$ came forward unwinding her wraps the colour of the cherry scarf in her fresh lips and cheeks i so sorry $zeena$
isnt there anything i can do no there nothing $zeena$ turned away from her you might a shook off that snow outside she said to her husband
she walked out of the kitchen ahead of them and pausing in the hall raised the lamp at arm length as if to #light# them up the stairs
the doors of the two bedrooms faced each other across the narrow upper landing and to #night# it was peculiarly repugnant to him that $mattie_silver$ should see him follow $zeena$
$ethan_frome$ paused also affecting to fumble for the peg on which he hung his coat and cap i guess i wont come up yet awhile he said turning as if to go back to the kitchen
$zeena$ stopped short and looked at him for the land sake what you going to do down here i ve got the mill accounts to go over
she continued to stare at him the flame of the unshaded lamp bringing out with microscopic cruelty the fretful #line# of her face
at this #time# #night# you ll ketch your death the fire out long ago without answering he moved away toward the kitchen
as he did so his glance crossed $mattie_silver$ and he fancied that a fugitive warning gleamed through her lashes the next moment they sank to her flushed cheeks and she began to mount the stairs ahead of $zeena$
it is powerful cold down here $ethan_frome$ assented and with lowered #head# he went up in his wife wake and followed her across the threshold of their room
there was some hauling to be done at the lower end of the wood lot and $ethan_frome$ was out early the next day
the sunrise burned red in a pure sky the shadows on the rim of the wood lot were darkly blue and beyond the white and scintillating fields patches of far off forest hung like smoke
when his muscles were swinging to their familiar task and his lungs expanding with long draughts of mountain air that $ethan_frome$ did his clearest thinking
that so iii the winter morning was as clear as crystal it was in the early morning stillness he and $zeena$ had not exchanged a #word# after the door of their room had closed on them
she had measured out some drops from a medicine bottle on a chair by the bed and after swallowing them and wrapping her #head# in a piece of yellow flannel had lain down with her face turned away
$ethan_frome$ undressed hurriedly and blew out the #light# so that he should not see her when he took his place at her side
as he lay there he could hear $mattie_silver$ moving about in her room and her candle sending its small ray across the landing drew a scarcely perceptible #line# of #light# under his door
he kept his #eye# fixed on the #light# till it vanished then the room grew perfectly black and not a sound was audible but $zeena$ asthmatic breathing
$ethan_frome$ felt confusedly that there were many things he ought to think about but through his tingling veins and tired brain only one sensation throbbed the warmth of $mattie_silver$ shoulder against his
why had he not kissed her when he held her there a few #hour# earlier he would not have asked himself the question
even a few minutes earlier when they had stood alone outside the house he would not have dared to think of kissing her
but since he had seen her lips in the lamplight he felt that they were his now in the bright morning air her face was still before him
it was part of the sun red and of the pure glitter on the snow how the girl had changed since she had come to $starkfield$
he remembered what a colourless slip of a thing she had looked the day he had met her at the station
and all the first winter how she had shivered with cold when the northerly gales shook the thin clapboards and the snow beat like hail against the loose hung windows
he had been afraid that she would hate the hard life the cold and loneliness but not a sign of discontent escaped her
$zeena$ took the view that $mattie_silver$ was bound to make the best of $starkfield$ since she hadnt any other place to go to but this did not strike $ethan_frome$ as conclusive
$zeena$ at any rate did not apply the principle in her own case he felt all the more sorry for the girl because misfortune had in a sense indentured her to them
$mattie_silver$ was the daughter of a cousin of zenobia $ethan_frome$ who had inflamed his clan with mingled sentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills to connecticut where he had married a stamford girl and succeeded to her father thriving drug business
his accounts revealed merely what the means had been and these were such that it was fortunate for his wife and daughter that his books were examined only after his impressive funeral
his wife died of the disclosure and $mattie_silver$ at twenty was left alone to make her way on the fifty dollars obtained from the sale of her piano
unhappily orin silver a man of far reaching aims had died too soon to prove that the end justifies the means for this purpose her equipment though varied was inadequate
she could trim a hat make molasses candy recite curfew shall not ring to #night# and play the lost chord and a pot pourri from carmen
when she tried to extend the field of her activities in the direction of stenography and book keeping her health broke down and six months on her feet behind the counter of a department store did not tend to restore it
her nearest relations had been induced to place their savings in her father #hand# and though after his death they ungrudgingly acquitted themselves of the christian duty of returning good for evil by giving his daughter all the advice at their disposal they could hardly be expected to supplement it by material aid
but when zenobia doctor recommended her looking about for some one to help her with the house work the clan instantly saw the chance of exacting a compensation from $mattie_silver$
zenobia though doubtful of the girl efficiency was tempted by the freedom to find fault without much risk of losing her and so $mattie_silver$ came to $starkfield$
during the first months $ethan_frome$ alternately burned with the desire to see $mattie_silver$ defy her and trembled with fear of the result
zenobia fault finding was of the silent kind but not the less penetrating for that then the situation grew less strained
the pure air and the long summer #hour# in the open gave back life and elasticity to $mattie_silver$ and $zeena$ with more leisure to devote to her complex ailments grew less watchful of the girl omissions so that $ethan_frome$ struggling on under the burden of his barren farm and failing saw mill could at least imagine that peace reigned in his house
there was really even now no tangible evidence to the contrary but since the previous #night# a vague dread had hung on his sky #line#
it was formed of $zeena$ obstinate silence of $mattie_silver$ sudden look of warning of the memory of just such fleeting imperceptible signs as those which told him on certain stainless mornings that before #night# there would be rain
the hauling was not over till mid day and as the lumber was to be delivered to andrew $mrs_ned_hale$ the $starkfield$ builder it was really easier for $ethan_frome$ to send $jotham_powell$ the hired man back to the farm on foot and drive the load down to the village himself
he had scrambled up on the logs and was sitting astride of them close over his shaggy grays when coming between him and their streaming necks he had a vision of the warning look that $mattie_silver$ had given him the #night# before
if there going to be any trouble i want to be there was his vague reflection as he threw to $jotham_powell$ the unexpected order to unhitch the team and lead them back to the barn
it was a slow trudge home through the heavy fields and when the two men entered the kitchen $mattie_silver$ was lifting the coffee from the stove and $zeena$ was already at the table
his dread was so strong that man like he sought to postpone certainty her husband stopped short at sight of her
instead of her usual calico wrapper and knitted shawl she wore her best dress of brown merino and above her thin strands of hair which still preserved the tight undulations of the crimping pins rose a hard perpendicular bonnet as to which $ethan_frome$ clearest notion was that he had to pay five dollars for it at the bettsbridge emporium
on the floor beside her stood his old valise and a bandbox wrapped in newspapers why where are you going $zeena$
i ve got my shooting pains so bad that i going over to bettsbridge to spend the #night# with aunt martha pierce and see that new doctor she answered in a matter of fact tone as if she had said she was going into the store room to take a look at the preserves or up to the attic to go over the blankets
twice or thrice before she had suddenly packed $ethan_frome$ valise and started off to bettsbridge or even springfield to seek the advice of some new doctor and her husband had grown to dread these expeditions because of their cost
$zeena$ always came back laden with expensive remedies and her last visit to springfield had been commemorated by her paying twenty dollars for an electric battery of which she had never been able to learn the use
he exclaimed in spite of her sedentary habits such abrupt decisions were not without precedent in $zeena$ history but for the moment his sense of relief was so great as to preclude all other feelings
he had now no doubt that $zeena$ had spoken the truth in saying the #night# before that she had sat up because she felt too mean to sleep her abrupt resolve to seek medical advice showed that as usual she was wholly absorbed in her health
as if expecting a protest she continued plaintively if you re too busy with the hauling i presume you can let $jotham_powell$ drive me over with the sorrel in #time# to ketch the train at the flats
during the winter months there was no stage between $starkfield$ and bettsbridge and the trains which stopped at corbury flats were slow and infrequent
her husband hardly heard what she was saying a rapid calculation showed $ethan_frome$ that $zeena$ could not be back at the farm before the following evening
if i supposed you a made any objection to $jotham_powell$ driving me over she began again as though his silence had implied refusal
on the brink of departure she was always seized with a flux of #word# all i know is she continued i cant go on the way i am much longer
the pains are clear away down to my ankles now or i a walked in to $starkfield$ on my own feet sooner put you out and asked michael $denis_eady$ to let me ride over on his wagon to the flats when he sends to meet the train that brings his groceries
i a had two #hour# to wait in the station but i sooner a done it even with this cold than to have you say
he became suddenly conscious that he was looking at $mattie_silver$ while $zeena$ talked to him and with an effort he turned his #eye# to his wife
she sat opposite the window and the pale #light# reflected from the banks of snow made her face look more than usually drawn and bloodless sharpened the three parallel creases between ear and cheek and drew querulous #line# from her thin nose to the corners of her mouth
of course $jotham_powell$ ll drive you over $ethan_frome$ roused himself to answer though she was but seven years her husband senior and he was only twenty eight she was already an old woman
the fact that for the first #time# since $mattie_silver$ had come to live with them $zeena$ was to be away for a #night#
$ethan_frome$ tried to say something befitting the occasion but there was only one thought in his mind he wondered if the girl were thinking of it too
he knew that $zeena$ must be wondering why he did not offer to drive her to the flats and let $jotham_powell$ take the lumber to $starkfield$ and at first he could not think of a pretext for not doing so then he said i take you over myself only i ve got to collect the cash for the lumber
as soon as the #word# were spoken he regretted them not only because they were untrue there being no prospect of his receiving cash payment from $mrs_ned_hale$ but also because he knew from experience the imprudence of letting $zeena$ think he was in funds on the eve of one of her therapeutic excursions
at the moment however his one desire was to avoid the long drive with her behind the ancient sorrel who never went out of a walk
$zeena$ made no reply she did not seem to hear what he had said she had already pushed her plate aside and was measuring out a draught from a large bottle at her elbow
it aint done me a speck of good but i guess i might as well use it up she remarked adding as she pushed the empty bottle toward $mattie_silver$ if you can get the taste out it ll do for pickles
iv as soon as his wife had driven off $ethan_frome$ took his coat and cap from the peg $mattie_silver$ was washing up the dishes humming one of the dance tunes of the #night# before
he said so long $matt$ and she answered gaily so long $ethan_frome$ and that was all it was warm and bright in the kitchen
the sun slanted through the south window on the girl moving figure on the cat dozing in a chair and on the geraniums brought in from the door way where $ethan_frome$ had planted them in the summer to make a garden for $mattie_silver$
he would have liked to linger on watching her tidy up and then settle down to her sewing but he wanted still more to get the hauling done and be back at the farm before #night#
the kitchen was a poor place not spruce and shining as his mother had kept it in his boyhood but it was surprising what a homelike look the mere fact of $zeena$ absence gave it
all the way down to the village he continued to think of his return to $mattie_silver$ and he pictured what it would be like that evening when he and $mattie_silver$ were there after supper
for the first #time# they would be alone together indoors and they would sit there one on each side of the stove like a married couple he in his stocking feet and smoking his pipe she laughing and talking in that funny way she had which was always as new to him as if he had never heard her before
the sweetness of the picture and the relief of knowing that his fears of trouble with $zeena$ were unfounded sent up his spirits with a rush and he who was usually so silent whistled and sang aloud as he drove through the snowy fields
by nature grave and inarticulate he admired recklessness and gaiety in others and was warmed to the marrow by friendly human intercourse
at worcester though he had the name of keeping to himself and not being much of a #hand# at a good #time# he had secretly gloried in being clapped on the back and hailed as old ethe or old stiff and the cessation of such familiarities had increased the chill of his return to $starkfield$
there was in him a slumbering spark of sociability which the long $starkfield$ winters had not yet extinguished there the silence had deepened about him year by year
left alone after his father accident to carry the burden of farm and mill he had had no #time# for convivial loiterings in the village and when his mother fell ill the loneliness of the house grew more oppressive than that of the fields
his mother had been a talker in her day but after her trouble the sound of her voice was seldom heard though she had not lost the power of speech
sometimes in the long winter evenings when in desperation her son asked her why she didnt say something she would lift a finger and answer because i listening and on stormy #night# when the loud wind was about the house she would complain if he spoke to her they re talking so out there that i cant hear you
it was only when she drew toward her last illness and his cousin zenobia pierce came over from the next valley to help him nurse her that human speech was heard again in the house
he felt that he might have gone like his mother if the sound of a new voice had not come to steady him
after the mortal silence of his long imprisonment $zeena$ volubility was music in his ears $zeena$ seemed to understand his case at a glance
she laughed at him for not knowing the simplest sick bed duties and told him to go right along out and leave her to see to things
the mere fact of obeying her orders of feeling free to go about his business again and talk with other men restored his shaken balance and magnified his sense of what he owed her
her efficiency shamed and dazzled him she seemed to possess by instinct all the household wisdom that his long apprenticeship had not instilled in him
when the end came it was she who had to tell him to hitch up and go for the undertaker and she thought it funny
after the funeral when he saw her preparing to go away he was seized with an unreasoning dread of being left alone on the farm and before he knew what he was doing he had asked her to stay there with him
he had often thought since that it would not have happened if his mother had died in spring instead of winter
when they married it was agreed that as soon as he could straighten out the difficulties resulting from mrs $ethan_frome$ long illness they would sell the farm and saw mill and try their luck in a large town
that he had not settled beforehand who was to have his mother clothes and the sewing machine $ethan_frome$ love of nature did not take the form of a taste for agriculture
he had always wanted to be an engineer and to live in towns where there were lectures and big libraries and fellows doing things
a slight engineering job in florida put in his way during his period of study at worcester increased his faith in his ability as well as his eagerness to see the world and he felt sure that with a smart wife like $zeena$ it would not be long before he had made himself a place in it
$zeena$ native village was slightly larger and nearer to the railway than $starkfield$ and she had let her husband see from the first that life on an isolated farm was not what she had expected when she married
she chose to look down on $starkfield$ but she could not have lived in a place which looked down on her
even bettsbridge or shadd falls would not have been sufficiently aware of her and in the greater cities which attracted $ethan_frome$ she would have suffered a complete loss of identity
and within a year of their marriage she developed the sickliness which had since made her notable even in a community rich in pathological instances
when she came to take care of his mother she had seemed to $ethan_frome$ like the very genius of health but he soon saw that her skill as a nurse had been acquired by the absorbed observation of her own symptoms
but purchasers were slow in coming and while he waited for them $ethan_frome$ learned the impossibility of transplanting her then she too fell silent
perhaps it was the inevitable effect of life on the farm or perhaps as she sometimes said it was because $ethan_frome$ never listened
when she spoke it was only to complain and to complain of things not in his power to remedy and to check a tendency to impatient retort he had first formed the habit of not answering her and finally of thinking of other things while she talked
the charge was not wholly unfounded of late however since he had reasons for observing her more closely her silence had begun to trouble him
$zeena$ who had at her fingers ends the pathological chart of the whole region had cited many cases of the kind while she was nursing his mother and he himself knew of certain lonely farm houses in the neighbourhood where stricken creatures pined and of others where sudden tragedy had come of their presence
he recalled his mother growing taciturnity and wondered if $zeena$ were also turning queer women did he knew at #time# looking at $zeena$ shut face he felt the chill of such forebodings
at other #time# her silence seemed deliberately assumed to conceal far reaching intentions mysterious conclusions drawn from suspicions and resentments impossible to guess
that supposition was even more disturbing than the other and it was the one which had come to him the #night# before when he had seen her standing in the kitchen door
now her departure for bettsbridge had once more eased his mind and all his thoughts were on the prospect of his evening with $mattie_silver$
only one thing weighed on him and that was his having told $zeena$ that he was to receive cash for the lumber
he foresaw so clearly the consequences of this imprudence that with considerable reluctance he decided to ask andrew $mrs_ned_hale$ for a small advance on his load
when $ethan_frome$ drove into $mrs_ned_hale$ yard the builder was just getting out of his sleigh hello ethe he said
andrew $mrs_ned_hale$ was a ruddy man with a big gray moustache and a stubbly double chin unconstrained by a collar but his scrupulously clean shirt was always fastened by a small diamond stud
this display of opulence was misleading for though he did a fairly good business it was known that his easygoing habits and the demands of his large family frequently kept him what $starkfield$ called behind
he was an old friend of $ethan_frome$ family and his house one of the few to which $zeena$ occasionally went drawn there by the fact that $mrs_ned_hale$ in her youth had done more doctoring than any other woman in $starkfield$ and was still a recognised authority on symptoms and treatment
this comes handy $mrs_ned_hale$ went up to the grays and patted their sweating flanks well sir he said you keep them two as if they was pets
$ethan_frome$ set about unloading the logs and when he had finished his job he pushed open the glazed door of the shed which the builder used as his office
$mrs_ned_hale$ sat with his feet up on the stove his back propped against a battered desk strewn with papers the place like the man was warm genial and untidy
the latter did not know how to begin but at length he managed to bring out his request for an advance of fifty dollars
sit right down and thaw out he greeted $ethan_frome$ the blood rushed to his thin skin under the sting of $mrs_ned_hale$ astonishment
it was the builder custom to pay at the end of three months and there was no precedent between the two men for a cash settlement
$ethan_frome$ felt that if he had pleaded an urgent need $mrs_ned_hale$ might have made shift to pay him but pride and an instinctive prudence kept him from resorting to this argument
after his father death it had taken #time# to get his #head# above water and he did not want andrew $mrs_ned_hale$ or any one else in $starkfield$ to think he was going under again
he therefore made his demand with the awkwardness of a proud man who will not admit to himself that he is stooping and he was not much surprised at $mrs_ned_hale$ refusal
the builder refused genially as he did everything else he treated the matter as something in the nature of a practical joke and wanted to know if $ethan_frome$ meditated buying a grand piano or adding a cupolo to his house offering in the latter case to give his services free of cost
$ethan_frome$ arts were soon exhausted and after an embarrassed pause he wished $mrs_ned_hale$ good day and opened the door of the office
besides he hated lying if he wanted the money he wanted it and it was nobody business to ask why as he passed out the builder suddenly called after him see here you aint in a tight place are you
not a bit $ethan_frome$ pride retorted before his reason had #time# to intervene well that good because i am a shade
business is pretty slack to begin with and then i fixing up a little house for $mrs_ned_hale$ and ruth when they re married
fact is i was going to ask you to give me a little extra #time# on that payment i glad to do it for em but it costs
his look appealed to $ethan_frome$ for sympathy the young people like things nice you know how it is yourself it not so long ago since you fixed up your own place for $zeena$
as he walked away the builder last phrase lingered in his ears and he reflected grimly that his seven years with $zeena$ seemed to $starkfield$ not so long
the afternoon was drawing to an end and here and there a lighted pane spangled the cold gray dusk and made the snow look whiter
$ethan_frome$ left the grays in $mrs_ned_hale$ stable and went about some other business in the village the bitter weather had driven every one indoors and $ethan_frome$ had the long rural street to himself
$ethan_frome$ recognised michael $denis_eady$ roan colt and young $denis_eady$ in a handsome new fur cap leaned forward and waved a greeting
suddenly he heard the brisk play of sleigh bells and a cutter passed him drawn by a free going horse hello ethe
the cutter was going in the direction of the $ethan_frome$ farm and $ethan_frome$ heart contracted as he listened to the dwindling bells
what more likely than that $denis_eady$ had heard of $zeena$ departure for bettsbridge and was profiting by the opportunity to spend an #hour# with $mattie_silver$
he shouted and spun on $ethan_frome$ was ashamed of the storm of jealousy in his breast it seemed unworthy of the girl that his thoughts of her should be so violent
he walked on to the church corner and entered the shade of the varnum spruces where he had stood with her the #night# before
at his approach it melted for an instant into two separate shapes and then conjoined again and he heard a kiss and a half laughing
as he passed into their gloom he saw an indistinct outline just ahead of him oh provoked by the discovery of his presence
again the outline hastily disunited and the varnum gate slammed on one half while the other hurried on ahead of him
$ethan_frome$ smiled at the discomfiture he had caused what did it matter to $mrs_ned_hale$ and ruth varnum if they were caught kissing each other
it pleased $ethan_frome$ to have surprised a pair of lovers on the spot where he and $mattie_silver$ had stood with such a thirst for each other in their hearts but he felt a pang at the thought that these two need not hide their happiness
everybody in $starkfield$ knew they were engaged he fetched the grays from $mrs_ned_hale$ stable and started on his long climb back to the farm
the cold was less sharp than earlier in the day and a thick fleecy sky threatened snow for the morrow here and there a star pricked through showing behind it a deep well of blue
in an #hour# or two the moon would push over the ridge behind the farm burn a gold edged rent in the clouds and then be swallowed by them
a mournful peace hung on the fields as though they felt the relaxing grasp of the cold and stretched themselves in their long winter sleep
as he drew near the farm he saw through the thin screen of larches at the gate a #light# twinkling in the house above him
$ethan_frome$ ears were alert for the jingle of sleigh bells but not a sound broke the silence of the lonely road
she up in her room he said to himself fixing herself up for supper and he remembered $zeena$ sarcastic stare when $mattie_silver$ on the evening of her arrival had come down to supper with smoothed hair and a ribbon at her neck
he passed by the graves on the knoll and turned his #head# to glance at one of the older headstones which had interested him deeply as a boy because it bore his name
he used to think that fifty years sounded like a long #time# to live together but now it seemed to him that they might pass in a flash
then with a sudden dart of irony he wondered if when their turn came the same epitaph would be written over him and $zeena$
he opened the barn door and craned his #head# into the obscurity half fearing to discover $denis_eady$ roan colt in the stall beside the sorrel
but the old horse was there alone mumbling his crib with toothless jaws and $ethan_frome$ whistled cheerfully while he bedded down the grays and shook an extra measure of oats into their mangers
his was not a tuneful throat but harsh melodies burst from it as he locked the barn and sprang up the hill to the house
sacred to the memory of $ethan_frome$ and endurance his wife who dwelled together in peace for fifty years he reached the kitchen porch and turned the door handle but the door did not yield to his touch
startled at finding it locked he rattled the handle violently then he reflected that $mattie_silver$ was alone and that it was natural she should barricade herself at nightfall
he stood in the darkness expecting to hear her step it did not come and after vainly straining his ears he called out in a voice that shook with joy
silence answered but in a minute or two he caught a sound on the stairs and saw a #line# of #light# about the door frame as he had seen it the #night# before
so strange was the precision with which the incidents of the previous evening were repeating themselves that he half expected when he heard the key turn to see his wife before him on the threshold but the door opened and $mattie_silver$ faced him
hello $matt$ she stood just as $zeena$ had stood a lifted lamp in her #hand# against the black background of the kitchen
she held the #light# at the same level and it drew out with the same distinctness her slim young throat and the brown wrist no bigger than a child
then striking upward it threw a lustrous fleck on her lips edged her #eye# with velvet shade and laid a milky whiteness above the black curve of her brows
she wore her usual dress of darkish stuff and there was no bow at her neck but through her hair she had run a streak of crimson ribbon
this tribute to the unusual transformed and glorified her she seemed to $ethan_frome$ taller fuller more womanly in shape and motion
she stood aside smiling silently while he entered and then moved away from him with something soft and flowing in her gait
she set the lamp on the table and he saw that it was carefully laid for supper with fresh dough nuts stewed blueberries and his favourite pickles in a dish of gay red glass
a bright fire glowed in the stove and the cat lay stretched before it watching the table with a drowsy #eye#
$ethan_frome$ was suffocated with the sense of well being he went out into the passage to hang up his coat and pull off his wet boots
when he came back $mattie_silver$ had set the teapot on the table and the cat was rubbing itself persuasively against her ankles
why puss i nearly tripped over you she cried the laughter sparkling through her lashes again $ethan_frome$ felt a sudden twinge of jealousy
could it be his coming that gave her such a kindled face well $matt$ any visitors he threw off stooping down carelessly to examine the fastening of the stove
she nodded and laughed yes one and he felt a blackness settling on his brows who was that he questioned raising himself up to slant a glance at her beneath his scowl
her #eye# danced with malice why $jotham_powell$ he came in after he got back and asked for a drop of coffee before he went down home
the blackness lifted and #light# flooded $ethan_frome$ brain that all well i hope you made out to let him have it
and after a pause he felt it right to add i suppose he got $zeena$ over to the flats all right
the name threw a chill between them and they stood a moment looking sideways at each other before $mattie_silver$ said with a shy laugh
oh yes in plenty of #time# i guess it about #time# for supper they drew their seats up to the table and the cat unbidden jumped between them into $zeena$ empty chair
oh puss said $mattie_silver$ and they laughed again $ethan_frome$ a moment earlier had felt himself on the brink of eloquence but the mention of $zeena$ had paralysed him
$mattie_silver$ seemed to feel the contagion of his embarrassment and sat with downcast lids sipping her tea while he feigned an insatiable appetite for dough nuts and sweet pickles
at last after casting about for an effective opening he took a long gulp of tea cleared his throat and said looks as if there be more snow
she feigned great interest is that so do you suppose it ll interfere with $zeena$ getting back she flushed red as the question escaped her and hastily set down the cup she was lifting
$ethan_frome$ reached over for another helping of pickles you never can tell this #time# of year it drifts so bad on the flats
the name had benumbed him again and once more he felt as if $zeena$ were in the room between them
the cat unnoticed had crept up on muffled paws from $zeena$ seat to the table and was stealthily elongating its body in the direction of the milk jug which stood between $ethan_frome$ and $mattie_silver$
oh puss you re too greedy $mattie_silver$ cried the two leaned forward at the same moment and their #hand# met on the handle of the jug
the cat profiting by this unusual demonstration tried to effect an unnoticed retreat and in doing so backed into the pickle dish which fell to the floor with a crash
$mattie_silver$ #hand# was underneath and $ethan_frome$ kept his clasped on it a moment longer than was necessary $mattie_silver$ in an instant had sprung from her chair and was down on her knees by the fragments
oh $ethan_frome$ ethan it all to pieces what will $zeena$ say but this #time# his courage was up well she ll have to say it to the cat any way
he rejoined with a laugh kneeling down at $mattie_silver$ side to scrape up the swimming pickles she lifted stricken #eye# to him
yes but you see she never meant it should be used not even when there was company and i had to get up on the step ladder to reach it down from the top shelf of the china closet where she keeps it with all her best things and of course she ll want to know why i did it the case was so serious that it called forth all of $ethan_frome$ latent resolution
she neednt know anything about it if you keep quiet i ll get another just like it to morrow where did it come from
i ll go to shadd falls for it if i have to oh you ll never get another even there it was a wedding present
dont you remember it came all the way from philadelphia from $zeena$ aunt that married the minister that why she wouldnt ever use it
she began to cry and he felt as if every one of her tears were pouring over him like burning lead
oh $ethan_frome$ ethan what in the world shall i do dont $matt$ dont oh dont he implored her
she struggled to her feet and he rose and followed her helplessly while she spread out the pieces of glass on the kitchen dresser
it seemed to him as if the shattered fragments of their evening lay there here give them to me he said in a voice of sudden authority
without replying he gathered the pieces of glass into his broad palm and walked out of the kitchen to the passage
there he lit a candle end opened the china closet and reaching his long arm up to the highest shelf laid the pieces together with such accuracy of touch that a close inspection convinced him of the impossibility of detecting from below that the dish was broken
if he glued it together the next morning months might elapse before his wife noticed what had happened and meanwhile he might after all be able to match the dish at shadd falls or bettsbridge
having satisfied himself that there was no risk of immediate discovery he went back to the kitchen with a lighter step and found $mattie_silver$ disconsolately removing the last scraps of pickle from the floor
she drew aside instinctively obeying his tone oh $ethan_frome$ what are you going to do it all right $matt$
completely reassured she shone on him through tear hung lashes and his soul swelled with pride as he saw how his tone subdued her
except when he was steering a big log down the mountain to his mill he had never known such a thrilling sense of mastery
they finished supper and while $mattie_silver$ cleared the table $ethan_frome$ went to look at the cows and then took a last turn about the house
come back and finish supper he commanded her she did not even ask what he had done the earth lay dark under a muffled sky and the air was so still that now
and then he heard a lump of snow come thumping down from a tree far off on the edge of the wood lot
when he returned to the kitchen $mattie_silver$ had pushed up his chair to the stove and seated herself near the lamp with a bit of sewing
the scene was just as he had dreamed of it that morning he sat down drew his pipe from his pocket and stretched his feet to the glow
his hard day work in the keen air made him feel at once lazy and #light# of mood and he had a confused sense of being in another world where all was warmth and harmony and #time# could bring no change
the only drawback to his complete well being was the fact that he could not see $mattie_silver$ from where he sat but he was too indolent to move and after a moment he said come over here and sit by the stove
as her young brown #head# detached itself against the patch work cushion that habitually framed his wife gaunt countenance $ethan_frome$ had a momentary shock
$zeena$ empty rocking chair stood facing him $mattie_silver$ rose obediently and seated herself in it it was almost as if the other face the face of the superseded woman had obliterated that of the intruder
she changed her position leaning forward to bend her #head# above her work so that he saw only the foreshortened tip of her nose and the streak of red in her hair then she slipped to her feet saying i cant see to sew and went back to her chair by the lamp
$ethan_frome$ made a pretext of getting up to replenish the stove and when he returned to his seat he pushed it sideways that he might get a view of her profile and of the lamplight falling on her #hand#
the cat who had been a puzzled observer of these unusual movements jumped up into $zeena$ chair rolled itself into a ball and lay watching them with narrowed #eye#
the clock ticked above the dresser a piece of charred wood fell now and then in the stove and the faint sharp scent of the geraniums mingled with the odour of $ethan_frome$ smoke which began to throw a blue haze about the lamp and to hang its greyish cobwebs in the shadowy corners of the room
after a moment $mattie_silver$ seemed to be affected by the same sense of constraint deep quiet sank on the room all constraint had vanished between the two and they began to talk easily and simply
they spoke of every day things of the prospect of snow of the next church sociable of the loves and quarrels of $starkfield$
the commonplace nature of what they said produced in $ethan_frome$ an illusion of long established intimacy which no outburst of emotion could have given and he set his imagination adrift on the fiction that they had always spent their evenings thus and would always go on doing so
this is the #night# we were to have gone coasting $matt$ he said at length with the rich sense as he spoke that they could go on any other #night# they chose since they had all #time# before them
she smiled back at him i guess you forgot no i didnt forget but it as dark as egypt outdoors
we might go to morrow if there a moon she laughed with pleasure her #head# tilted back the lamplight sparkling on her lips and teeth
he kept his #eye# fixed on her marvelling at the way her face changed with each turn of their talk like a wheat field under a summer breeze
it was intoxicating to find such magic in his clumsy #word# and he longed to try new ways of using it
that would be lovely $ethan_frome$ would you be scared to go down the corbury road with me on a #night# like this
he asked her cheeks burned redder i aint any more scared than you are well i be scared then i wouldnt do it
that an ugly corner down by the big elm if a fellow didnt keep his #eye# open he go plumb into it
he luxuriated in the sense of protection and authority which his #word# conveyed to prolong and intensify the feeling he added i guess we re well enough here
her tone was so sweet that he took the pipe from his mouth and drew his chair up to the table
she let her lids sink slowly in the way he loved yes we re well enough here she sighed leaning forward he touched the farther end of the strip of brown stuff that she was hemming
say $matt$ he began with a smile what do you think i saw under the varnum spruces coming along home just now
the #word# had been on his tongue all the evening but now that he had spoken them they struck him as inexpressibly vulgar and out of place
$mattie_silver$ blushed to the roots of her hair and pulled her needle rapidly twice or thrice through her work insensibly drawing the end of it away from him
i suppose it was ruth and $mrs_ned_hale$ she said in a low voice as though he had suddenly touched on something grave
$ethan_frome$ had imagined that his allusion might open the way to the accepted pleasantries and these perhaps in turn to a harmless caress if only a mere touch on her #hand#
i saw a friend of yours getting kissed but now he felt as if her blush had set a flaming guard about her
he knew that most young men made nothing at all of giving a pretty girl a kiss and he remembered that the #night# before when he had put his arm about $mattie_silver$ she had not resisted
he supposed it was his natural awkwardness that made him feel so but that had been out of doors under the open irresponsible #night#
now in the warm lamplit room with all its ancient implications of conformity and order she seemed infinitely farther away from him and more unapproachable
to ease his constraint he said i suppose they ll be setting a date before long yes i shouldnt wonder if they got married some #time# along in the summer
she pronounced the #word# married as if her voice caressed it it seemed a rustling covert leading to enchanted glades
a pang shot through $ethan_frome$ and he said twisting away from her in his chair it ll be your turn next i wouldnt wonder
she laughed a little uncertainly why do you keep on saying that he echoed her laugh i guess i do it to get used to the idea
he drew up to the table again and she sewed on in silence with dropped lashes while he sat in fascinated contemplation of the way in which her #hand# went up and down above the strip of stuff just as he had seen a pair of birds make short perpendicular flights over a nest they were building
at length without turning her #head# or lifting her lids she said in a low tone it not because you think $zeena$ got anything against me is it
his former dread started up full armed at the suggestion why what do you mean he stammered she raised distressed #eye# to his her work dropping on the table between them
i dont know i thought last #night# she seemed to have i like to know what he growled
it was the first #time# they had ever spoken so openly of her attitude toward $mattie_silver$ and the repetition of the name seemed to carry it to the farther corners of the room and send it back to them in long repercussions of sound
$mattie_silver$ waited as if to give the echo #time# to drop and then went on she hasnt said anything to you
nobody can tell with $zeena$ he shook his #head# no not a #word# she tossed the hair back from her forehead with a laugh
i guess i just nervous then i not going to think about it any more oh no dont let think about it $matt$
the sudden heat of his tone made her colour mount again not with a rush but gradually delicately like the reflection of a thought stealing slowly across her heart
she sat silent her #hand# clasped on her work and it seemed to him that a warm current flowed toward him along the strip of stuff that still lay unrolled between them
a faint vibration of her lashes seemed to show that she was aware of his gesture and that it had sent a counter current back to her and she let her #hand# lie motionless on the other end of the strip
cautiously he slid his #hand# palm downward along the table till his finger tips touched the end of the stuff as they sat thus he heard a sound behind him and turned his #head#
the cat had jumped from $zeena$ chair to dart at a mouse in the wainscot and as a result of the sudden movement the empty chair had set up a spectral rocking
she ll be rocking in it herself this #time# to morrow $ethan_frome$ thought i ve been in a dream and this is the only evening we ll ever have together
his body and brain ached with indescribable weariness and he could think of nothing to say or to do that should arrest the mad flight of the moments
the return to reality was as painful as the return to consciousness after taking an anaesthetic his alteration of mood seemed to have communicated itself to $mattie_silver$
she looked up at him languidly as though her lids were weighted with sleep and it cost her an effort to raise them
her glance fell on his #hand# which now completely covered the end of her work and grasped it as if it were a part of herself
he saw a scarcely perceptible tremor cross her face and without knowing what he did he stooped his #head# and kissed the bit of stuff in his hold
as his lips rested on it he felt it glide slowly from beneath them and saw that $mattie_silver$ had risen and was silently rolling up her work
she fastened it with a pin and then finding her thimble and scissors put them with the roll of stuff into the box covered with fancy paper which he had once brought to her from bettsbridge
he stood up also looking vaguely about the room the clock above the dresser struck eleven is the fire all right
when he raised himself again he saw that she was dragging toward the stove the old soap box lined with carpet in which the cat made its bed
then she recrossed the floor and lifted two of the geranium pots in her arms moving them away from the cold window
he followed her and brought the other geraniums the hyacinth bulbs in a cracked custard bowl and the german ivy trained over an old croquet hoop
when these nightly duties were performed there was nothing left to do but to bring in the tin candlestick from the passage #light# the candle and blow out the lamp
$ethan_frome$ put the candlestick in $mattie_silver$ #hand# and she went out of the kitchen ahead of him the #light# that she carried before her making her dark hair look like a drift of mist on the moon
she asked in a low voice he opened the door of the stove and poked aimlessly at the embers
good #night# $matt$ he said as she put her foot on the first step of the stairs she turned and looked at him a moment
good #night# $ethan_frome$ she answered and went up when the door of her room had closed on her he remembered that he had not even touched her #hand#
the next morning at breakfast $jotham_powell$ was between them and $ethan_frome$ tried to hide his joy under an air of exaggerated indifference lounging back in his chair to throw scraps to the cat growling at the weather and not so much as offering to help $mattie_silver$ when she rose to clear away the dishes
vi he did not know why he was so irrationally happy for nothing was changed in his life or hers he had not even touched the tip of her fingers or looked her full in the #eye#
but their evening together had given him a vision of what life at her side might be and he was glad now that he had done nothing to trouble the sweetness of the picture
there was a last load of lumber to be hauled to the village and $jotham_powell$ who did not work regularly for $ethan_frome$ in winter had come round to help with the job
he had a fancy that she knew what had restrained him but a wet snow melting to sleet had fallen in the #night# and turned the roads to glass
there was more wet in the air and it seemed likely to both men that the weather would milden toward afternoon and make the going safer
$ethan_frome$ therefore proposed to his assistant that they should load the sledge at the wood lot as they had done on the previous morning and put off the teaming to $starkfield$ till later in the day
this plan had the advantage of enabling him to send $jotham_powell$ to the flats after dinner to meet zenobia while he himself took the lumber down to the village
he told $jotham_powell$ to go out and harness up the greys and for a moment he and $mattie_silver$ had the kitchen to themselves
she had plunged the breakfast dishes into a tin dish pan and was bending above it with her slim arms bared to the elbow the steam from the hot water beading her forehead and tightening her rough hair into little brown rings like the tendrils on the traveller joy
$ethan_frome$ stood looking at her his heart in his throat he wanted to say we shall never be alone again like this
instead he reached down his tobacco pouch from a shelf of the dresser put it into his pocket and said i guess i can make out to be home for dinner
as soon as the sledge was loaded he meant to send $jotham_powell$ back to the farm and hurry on foot into the village to buy the glue for the pickle dish
she answered all right $ethan_frome$ and he heard her singing over the dishes as he went with ordinary luck he should have had #time# to carry out this plan but everything went wrong from the start
on the way over to the wood lot one of the greys slipped on a glare of ice and cut his knee and when they got him up again $jotham_powell$ had to go back to the barn for a strip of rag to bind the cut
then when the loading finally began a sleety rain was coming down once more and the tree trunks were so slippery that it took twice as long as usual to lift them and get them in place on the sledge
it was what $jotham_powell$ called a sour morning for work and the horses shivering and stamping under their wet blankets seemed to like it as little as the men
it was long past the dinner #hour# when the job was done and $ethan_frome$ had to give up going to the village because he wanted to lead the injured horse home and wash the cut himself
he thought that by starting out again with the lumber as soon as he had finished his dinner he might get back to the farm with the glue before $jotham_powell$ and the old sorrel had had #time# to fetch zenobia from the flats but he knew the chance was a slight one
it turned on the state of the roads and on the possible lateness of the bettsbridge train he remembered afterward with a grim flash of self derision what importance he had attached to the weighing of these probabilities
as soon as dinner was over he set out again for the wood lot not daring to linger till $jotham_powell$ left
the hired man was still drying his wet feet at the stove and $ethan_frome$ could only give $mattie_silver$ a quick look as he said beneath his breath
i ll be back early he fancied that she nodded her comprehension and with that scant solace he had to trudge off through the rain
he had driven his load half way to the village when $jotham_powell$ overtook him urging the reluctant sorrel toward the flats
i ll have to hurry up to do it $ethan_frome$ mused as the sleigh dropped down ahead of him over the dip of the school house hill
he worked like ten at the unloading and when it was over hastened on to michael $denis_eady$ for the glue
$denis_eady$ and his assistant were both down street and young $denis_eady$ who seldom deigned to take their place was lounging by the stove with a knot of the golden youth of $starkfield$
$ethan_frome$ consumed with the longing for a last moment alone with $mattie_silver$ hung about impatiently while $denis_eady$ made an ineffectual search in the obscurer corners of the store
they hailed $ethan_frome$ with ironic compliment and offers of conviviality but no one knew where to find the glue looks as if we were all sold out
but if you ll wait around till the old man comes along maybe he can put his #hand# on it
i obliged to you but i ll try if i can get it down at mrs homan $ethan_frome$ answered burning to be gone
$denis_eady$ commercial instinct compelled him to aver on oath that what $denis_eady$ store could not produce would never be found at the widow
homan but $ethan_frome$ heedless of this boast had already climbed to the sledge and was driving on to the rival establishment
here after considerable search and sympathetic questions as to what he wanted it for and whether ordinary flour paste wouldnt do as well if she couldnt find it the widow homan finally hunted down her solitary bottle of glue to its hiding place in a medley of cough lozenges and corset laces
i hope $zeena$ aint broken anything she sets store by she called after him as he turned the greys toward home
the fitful bursts of sleet had changed into a steady rain and the horses had heavy work even without a load behind them
once or twice hearing sleigh bells $ethan_frome$ turned his #head# fancying that $zeena$ and $jotham_powell$ might overtake him but the old sorrel was not in sight and he set his face against the rain and urged on his ponderous pair
the barn was empty when the horses turned into it and after giving them the most perfunctory ministrations they had ever received from him he strode up to the house and pushed open the kitchen door
she was bending over a pan on the stove but at the sound of his step she turned with a start and sprang to him
$mattie_silver$ was there alone as he had pictured her see here $matt$ i ve got some stuff to mend the dish with
let me get at it quick he cried waving the bottle in one #hand# while he put her lightly aside but she did not seem to hear him
oh $ethan_frome$ $zeena$ come she said in a whisper clutching his sleeve they stood and stared at each other pale as culprits
$jotham_powell$ brought some goods over from the flats for his wife and he drove right on home with them she explained
but the sorrel not in the barn $ethan_frome$ stammered he gazed blankly about the kitchen which looked cold and squalid in the rainy winter twilight
how is she he asked dropping his voice to $mattie_silver$ whisper she looked away from him uncertainly i dont know
she went right up to her room she didnt say anything no $ethan_frome$ let out his doubts in a low whistle and thrust the bottle back into his pocket
dont fret i ll come down and mend it in the #night# he said he pulled on his wet coat again and went back to the barn to feed the greys
while he was there $jotham_powell$ drove up with the sleigh and when the horses had been attended to $ethan_frome$ said to him you might as well come back up for a bite
he was not sorry to assure himself of $jotham_powell$ neutralising presence at the supper table for $zeena$ was always nervous after a journey
but the hired man though seldom loth to accept a meal not included in his wages opened his stiff jaws to answer slowly
i obliged to you but i guess i ll go along back $ethan_frome$ looked at him in surprise better come up and dry off
$jotham_powell$ facial muscles were unmoved by this appeal and his vocabulary being limited he merely repeated i guess i ll go along back
to $ethan_frome$ there was something vaguely ominous in this stolid rejection of free food and warmth and he wondered what had happened on the drive to nerve $jotham_powell$ to such stoicism
perhaps $zeena$ had failed to see the new doctor or had not liked his counsels $ethan_frome$ knew that in such cases the first person she met was likely to be held responsible for her grievance
looks as if there be something hot for supper when he re entered the kitchen the lamp lit up the same scene of shining comfort as on the previous evening
the table had been as carefully laid a clear fire glowed in the stove the cat dozed in its warmth and $mattie_silver$ came forward carrying a plate of dough nuts
she and $ethan_frome$ looked at each other in silence then she said as she had said the #night# before i guess it about #time# for supper
vii $ethan_frome$ went out into the passage to hang up his wet garments he listened for $zeena$ step and not hearing it called her name up the stairs
the room was almost dark but in the obscurity he saw her sitting by the window bolt upright and knew by the rigidity of the outline projected against the pane that she had not taken off her travelling dress
she did not answer and after a moment hesitation he went up and opened her door well $zeena$ he ventured from the threshold
she did not move and he continued supper about ready aint you coming she replied i dont feel as if i could touch a morsel
it was the consecrated formula and he expected it to be followed as usual by her rising and going down to supper
but she remained seated and he could think of nothing more felicitous than i presume you re tired after the long ride
turning her #head# at this she answered solemnly i a great deal sicker than you think her #word# fell on his ear with a strange shock of wonder
he had often heard her pronounce them before what if at last they were true he advanced a step or two into the dim room
she continued to gaze at him through the twilight with a mien of wan authority as of one consciously singled out for a great fate
i hope that not so $zeena$ he said i ve got complications she said $ethan_frome$ knew the #word# for one of exceptional import
almost everybody in the neighbourhood had troubles frankly localized and specified but only the chosen had complications to have them was in itself a distinction though it was also in most cases a death warrant
people struggled on for years with troubles but they almost always succumbed to complications $ethan_frome$ heart was jerking to and fro between two extremities of feeling but for the moment compassion prevailed
his wife looked so hard and lonely sitting there in the darkness with such thoughts is that what the new doctor told you he asked instinctively lowering his voice
$ethan_frome$ was aware that in regard to the important question of surgical intervention the female opinion of the neighbourhood was divided some glorying in the prestige conferred by operations while others shunned them as indelicate
yes he says any regular doctor would want me to have an operation $ethan_frome$ from motives of economy had always been glad that $zeena$ was of the latter faction
in the agitation caused by the gravity of her announcement he sought a consolatory short cut what do you know about this doctor anyway
nobody ever told you that before he saw his blunder before she could take it up she wanted sympathy not consolation
i didnt need to have anybody tell me i was losing ground every day everybody but you could see it
and everybody in bettsbridge knows about dr buck he has his office in worcester and comes over once a fortnight to shadd falls and bettsbridge for consultations
eliza spears was wasting away with kidney trouble before she went to him and now she up and around and singing in the choir
well i glad of that you must do just what he tells you $ethan_frome$ answered sympathetically she was still looking at him
i mean to she said he was struck by a new note in her voice it was neither whining nor reproachful but drily resolute
what does he want you should do he asked with a mounting vision of fresh expenses he wants i should have a hired girl
he says i oughtnt to have to do a single thing around the house a hired girl $ethan_frome$ stood transfixed
everybody said i was lucky to get a girl to come away out here and i agreed to give her a dollar extry to make sure
yes and aunt martha found me one right off she ll be over to morrow afternoon wrath and dismay contended in $ethan_frome$
he no longer believed what $zeena$ had told him of the supposed seriousness of her state he saw in her expedition to bettsbridge only a plot hatched between herself and her pierce relations to foist on him the cost of a servant and for the moment wrath predominated
he had foreseen an immediate demand for money but not a permanent drain on his scant resources if you meant to engage a girl you ought to have told me before you started he said
how could i tell you before i started how did i know what dr buck would say oh dr buck $ethan_frome$ incredulity escaped in a short laugh
did dr buck tell you how i was to pay her wages her voice rose furiously with his
for i a been ashamed to tell him that you grudged me the money to get back my health when i lost it nursing your own mother
no he didnt you lost your health nursing mother yes and my folks all told me at the #time# you couldnt do no less than marry me after
$zeena$ through the obscurity which hid their faces their thoughts seemed to dart at each other like serpents shooting venom
$ethan_frome$ was seized with horror of the scene and shame at his own share in it it was as senseless and savage as a physical fight between two enemies in the darkness
at first its weak flame made no impression on the shadows then $zeena$ face stood grimly out against the uncurtained pane which had turned from grey to black
it was the first scene of open anger between the couple in their sad seven years together and $ethan_frome$ felt as if he had lost an irretrievable advantage in descending to the level of recrimination
he turned to the shelf above the chimney groped for matches and lit the one candle in the room but the practical problem was there and had to be dealt with
you know i havent got the money to pay for a girl $zeena$ you ll have to send her back i cant do it
the doctor says it ll be my death if i go on slaving the way i ve had to he doesnt understand how i ve stood it as long as i have
slaving he checked himself again you sha nt lift a #hand# if he says so i ll do everything round the house myself
she broke in you re neglecting the farm enough already and this being true he found no answer and left her #time# to add ironically better send me over to the almshouse and done with it
i guess there been fromes there afore now the taunt burned into him but he let it pass i havent got the money
then $zeena$ said in a level voice i thought you were to get fifty dollars from andrew $mrs_ned_hale$ for that lumber
that settles it there was a moment pause in the struggle as though the combatants were testing their weapons andrew $mrs_ned_hale$ never pays under three months
he had hardly spoken when he remembered the excuse he had made for not accompanying his wife to the station the day before and the blood rose to his frowning brows
why you told me yesterday you fixed it up with him to pay cash down you said that was why you couldnt drive me over to the flats
$ethan_frome$ had no suppleness in deceiving he had never before been convicted of a lie and all the resources of evasion failed him
i guess that was a misunderstanding he stammered you aint got the money no and you aint going to get it
no well i couldnt know that when i engaged the girl could i no he paused to control his voice
but you know it now i sorry but it cant be helped you re a poor man wife $zeena$ but i ll do the best i can for you
for a while she sat motionless as if reflecting her arms stretched along the arms of her chair her #eye# fixed on vacancy
oh i guess we ll make out she said mildly the change in her tone reassured him of course we will
there a whole lot more i can do for you and $mattie_silver$ $zeena$ while he spoke seemed to be following out some elaborate mental calculation
she emerged from it to say there ll be $mattie_silver$ board less any how $ethan_frome$ supposing the discussion to be over had turned to go down to supper
he stopped short not grasping what he heard $mattie_silver$ board less he began $zeena$ laughed it was on odd unfamiliar sound he did not remember ever having heard her laugh before
you didnt suppose i was going to keep two girls did you no wonder you were scared at the expense
from the beginning of the discussion he had instinctively avoided the mention of $mattie_silver$ name fearing he hardly knew what criticism complaints or vague allusions to the imminent probability of her marrying
but the thought of a definite rupture had never come to him and even now could not lodge itself in his mind
he still had but a confused sense of what she was saying i dont know what you mean he said
$mattie_silver$ not a hired girl she your relation she a pauper that hung onto us all after her father done his best to ruin us
as the shrill #word# shot out $ethan_frome$ heard a tap on the door which he had drawn shut when he turned back from the threshold
i ve kep her here a whole year it somebody else turn now $ethan_frome$ $zeena$ $mattie_silver$ voice sounded gaily from the landing
inside the room there was a moment silence then $zeena$ called out from her seat i not coming down to supper
do you know what #time# it is supper been ready half an #hour# oh i sorry arent you well
sha nt i bring you up a bite of something $ethan_frome$ roused himself with an effort and opened the door go along down $matt$
he heard her all right and her quick step on the stairs then he shut the door and turned back into the room
$zeena$ just a little tired i coming his wife attitude was unchanged her face inexorable and he was seized with the despairing sense of his helplessness
you aint going to do it $zeena$ do what she emitted between flattened lips send $mattie_silver$ away like this
he continued with rising vehemence you cant put her out of the house like a thief a poor girl without friends or money
i never bargained to take her for life she done her best for you and she got no place to go to
you may forget she your kin but everybody else ll remember it if you do a thing like that what do you suppose folks ll say of you
$zeena$ waited a moment as if giving him #time# to feel the full force of the contrast between his own excitement and her composure
then she replied in the same smooth voice i know well enough what they say of my having kep her here as long as i have
$ethan_frome$ #hand# dropped from the door knob which he had held clenched since he had drawn the door shut on $mattie_silver$
he had meant to humble himself to argue that $mattie_silver$ keep didnt cost much after all that he could make out to buy a stove and fix up a place in the attic for the hired girl but $zeena$ #word# revealed the peril of such pleadings
his wife retort was like a knife cut across the sinews and he felt suddenly weak and powerless you mean to tell her she got to go at once
as if trying to make him see reason she replied impartially the girl will be over from bettsbridge to morrow and i presume she got to have somewheres to sleep
she was no longer the listless creature who had lived at his side in a state of sullen self absorption but a mysterious alien presence an evil energy secreted from the long years of silent brooding
he faltered out in terror of letting his wife complete her sentence $ethan_frome$ looked at her with loathing it was the sense of his helplessness that sharpened his antipathy
there had never been anything in her that one could appeal to but as long as he could ignore and command he had remained indifferent
$mattie_silver$ was her relation not his there were no means by which he could compel her to keep the girl under her roof
all the long misery of his baffled past of his youth of failure hardship and vain effort rose up in his soul in bitterness and seemed to take shape before him in the woman who at every turn had barred his way
she had taken everything else from him and now she meant to take the one thing that made up for all the others
for a moment such a flame of hate rose in him that it ran down his arm and clenched his fist against her
now she had mastered him and he abhorred her he took a wild step forward and then stopped you re you re not coming down
i guess i ll lay down on the bed a little while she answered mildly and he turned and walked out of the room
he said in a bewildered voice no in the kitchen $mattie_silver$ was sitting by the stove the cat curled up on her knees
she sprang to her feet as $ethan_frome$ entered and carried the covered dish of meat pie to the table i hope $zeena$ isnt sick
she asked no she shone at him across the table well sit right down then you must be starving
she uncovered the pie and pushed it over to him so they were to have one more evening together her happy #eye# seemed to say
he helped himself mechanically and began to eat then disgust took him by the throat and he laid down his fork
$mattie_silver$ tender gaze was on him and she marked the gesture why $ethan_frome$ what the matter dont it taste right
yes it first rate only i he pushed his plate away rose from his chair and walked around the table to her side
she seemed to melt against him in her terror and he caught her in his arms held her fast there felt her lashes beat his cheek like netted butterflies
she started up with frightened #eye# $ethan_frome$ there something wrong i knew there was what is it what is it
she stammered but he had found her lips at last and was drinking unconsciousness of everything but the joy they gave him
she lingered a moment caught in the same strong current then she slipped from him and drew back a step or two pale and troubled
her look smote him with compunction and he cried out as if he saw her drowning in a dream you cant go $matt$
the #word# went on sounding between them as though a torch of warning flew from #hand# to #hand# through a black landscape
i ll never let you go go she stammered must i go $ethan_frome$ was overcome with shame at his lack of self control in flinging the news at her so brutally
his #head# reeled and he had to support himself against the table all the while he felt as if he were still kissing her and yet dying of thirst for her lips
$ethan_frome$ what has happened is $zeena$ mad with me her cry steadied him though it deepened his wrath and pity
no no he assured her it not that but this new doctor has scared her about herself you know she believes all they say the first #time# she sees them
and this one told her she wont get well unless she lays up and dont do a thing about the house not for months
she was so small and weak looking that it wrung his heart but suddenly she lifted her #head# and looked straight at him
he paused his #eye# wandering from her miserably she stood silent a moment drooping before him like a broken branch
and she wants somebody handier in my place is that it that what she says to #night# if she says it to #night# she ll say it to morrow
both bowed to the inexorable truth they knew that $zeena$ never changed her mind and that in her case a resolve once taken was equivalent to an act performed
there was a long silence between them then $mattie_silver$ said in a low voice dont be too sorry $ethan_frome$
oh god oh god he groaned the glow of passion he had felt for her had melted to an aching tenderness
he saw her quick lids beating back the tears and longed to take her in his arms and soothe her
you re letting your supper get cold she admonished him with a pale gleam of gaiety oh $matt$ matt where ll you go to
her lids sank and a tremor crossed her face he saw that for the first #time# the thought of the future came to her distinctly
i might get something to do over at stamford she faltered as if knowing that he knew she had no hope
he dropped back into his seat and hid his face in his #hand# despair seized him at the thought of her setting out alone to renew the weary quest for work
in the only place where she was known she was surrounded by indifference or animosity and what chance had she inexperienced and untrained among the million bread seekers of the cities
there came back to him miserable tales he had heard at worcester and the faces of girls whose lives had begun as hopefully as $mattie_silver$
it was not possible to think of such things without a revolt of his whole being he sprang up suddenly
you cant go $matt$ i wont let you she always had her way but i mean to have mine now
$mattie_silver$ lifted her #hand# with a quick gesture and he heard his wife step behind him $zeena$ came into the room with her dragging down at the heel step and quietly took her accustomed seat between them
i felt a little mite better and dr buck says i ought to eat all i can to keep my strength up even if i aint got any appetite she said in her flat whine reaching across $mattie_silver$ for the teapot
her good dress had been replaced by the black calico and brown knitted shawl which formed her daily wear and with them she had put on her usual face and manner
she poured out her tea added a great deal of milk to it helped herself largely to pie and pickles and made the familiar gesture of adjusting her false teeth before she began to eat
the cat rubbed itself ingratiatingly against her and she said good pussy stooped to stroke it and gave it a scrap of meat from her plate
$ethan_frome$ sat speechless not pretending to eat but $mattie_silver$ nibbled valiantly at her food and asked $zeena$ one or two questions about her visit to bettsbridge
$zeena$ answered in her every day tone and warming to the theme regaled them with several vivid descriptions of intestinal disturbances among her friends and relatives
she looked straight at $mattie_silver$ as she spoke a faint smile deepening the vertical #line# between her nose and chin
when supper was over she rose from her seat and pressed her #hand# to the flat surface over the region of her heart
that pie of yours always sets a mite heavy $matt$ she said not ill naturedly she seldom abbreviated the girl name and when she did so it was always a sign of affability
i ve a good mind to go and hunt up those stomach powders i got last year over in springfield she continued
i aint tried them for quite a while and maybe they ll help the heartburn $mattie_silver$ lifted her #eye#
cant i get them for you $zeena$ she ventured no they re in a place you dont know about $zeena$ answered darkly with one of her secret looks
she went out of the kitchen and $mattie_silver$ rising began to clear the dishes from the table as she passed $ethan_frome$ chair their #eye# met and clung together desolately
the cat had sprung to $zeena$ rocking chair and the heat of the fire was beginning to draw out the faint sharp scent of the geraniums
the warm still kitchen looked as peaceful as the #night# before $ethan_frome$ dragged himself wearily to his feet i ll go out and take a look around he said going toward the passage to get his lantern
as he reached the door he met $zeena$ coming back into the room her lips twitching with anger a flush of excitement on her sallow face
the shawl had slipped from her shoulders and was dragging at her down trodden heels and in her #hand# she carried the fragments of the red glass pickle dish
there was no answer and she continued in a trembling voice i went to get those powders i put away in father old spectacle case top of the china closet where i keep the things i set store by so folks shant meddle with them
i like to know who done this she said looking sternly from $ethan_frome$ to $mattie_silver$ her voice broke and two small tears hung on her lashless lids and ran slowly down her cheeks
it takes the stepladder to get at the top shelf and i put aunt philura maple pickle dish up there purpose when we was married and it never been down since cept for the spring cleaning and then i always lifted it with my own #hand#
so st it shouldnt get broke she laid the fragments reverently on the table i want to know who done this she quavered
at the challenge $ethan_frome$ turned back into the room and faced her i can tell you then the cat done it
the cat that what i said she looked at him hard and then turned her #eye# to $mattie_silver$ who was carrying the dish pan to the table
i like to know how the cat got into my china closet she said chasin mice i guess $ethan_frome$ rejoined
there was a mouse round the kitchen all last evening $zeena$ continued to look from one to the other then she emitted her small strange laugh
i knew the cat was a smart cat she said in a high voice but i didnt know he was smart enough to pick up the pieces of my pickle dish and lay em edge to edge on the very shelf he knocked em off of
the cat did break the dish but i got it down from the china closet and i the one to blame for its getting broken
$zeena$ stood beside the ruin of her treasure stiffening into a stony image of resentment you got down my pickle dish what for
$mattie_silver$ suddenly drew her arms out of the steaming water it wasnt $ethan_frome$ fault $zeena$ a bright flush flew to $mattie_silver$ cheeks
you wanted to make the supper table pretty and you waited till my back was turned and took the thing i set most store by of anything i ve got and wouldnt never use it not even when the minister come to dinner or aunt martha pierce come over from bettsbridge
i wanted to make the supper table pretty she said $zeena$ paused with a gasp as if terrified by her own evocation of the sacrilege
it the way your father begun and i was warned of it when i took you and i tried to keep my things where you couldnt get at em and now you ve took from me the one i cared for most of all
she broke off in a short spasm of sobs that passed and left her more than ever like a shape of stone
if i a listened to folks you a gone before now and this wouldnt a happened she said and gathering up the bits of broken glass she went out of the room as if she carried a dead body
when $ethan_frome$ was called back to the farm by his father illness his mother gave him for his own use a small room behind the untenanted best parlour
here he had nailed up shelves for his books built himself a box sofa out of boards and a mattress laid out his papers on a kitchen table hung on the rough plaster wall an engraving of abraham lincoln and a calendar with thoughts from the poets and tried with these meagre properties to produce some likeness to the study of a minister who had been kind to him and lent him books when he was at worcester
he still took refuge there in summer but when $mattie_silver$ came to live at the farm he had to give her his stove and consequently the room was uninhabitable for several months of the year
to this retreat he descended as soon as the house was quiet and $zeena$ steady breathing from the bed had assured him that there was to be no sequel to the scene in the kitchen
you re a bad girl $mattie_silver$ and i always known it viii after $zeena$ departure he and $mattie_silver$ had stood speechless neither seeking to approach the other
then the girl had returned to her task of clearing up the kitchen for the #night# and he had taken his lantern and gone on his usual round outside the house
the kitchen was empty when he came back to it but his tobacco pouch and pipe had been laid on the table and under them was a scrap of paper torn from the back of a seedsman catalogue on which three #word# were written
going into his cold dark study he placed the lantern on the table and stooping to its #light# read the message again and again
it was the first #time# that $mattie_silver$ had ever written to him and the possession of the paper gave him a strange new sense of her nearness yet it deepened his anguish by reminding him that henceforth they would have no other way of communicating with each other
dont trouble $ethan_frome$ for the life of her smile the warmth of her voice only cold paper and dead #word#
he was too young too strong too full of the sap of living to submit so easily to the destruction of his hopes
confused motions of rebellion stormed in him must he wear out all his years at the side of a bitter querulous woman
other possibilities had been in him possibilities sacrificed one by one to $zeena$ narrow mindedness and ignorance and what good had come of it
she was a hundred #time# bitterer and more discontented than when he had married her the one pleasure left her was to inflict pain on him
all the healthy instincts of self defence rose up in him against such waste he bundled himself into his old coon skin coat and lay down on the box sofa to think
it was a cushion which $zeena$ had made for him when they were engaged the only piece of needlework he had ever seen her do
under his cheek he felt a hard object with strange protuberances he flung it across the floor and propped his #head# against the wall
he knew a case of a man over the mountain a young fellow of about his own age who had escaped from just such a life of misery by going west with the girl he cared for
his wife had divorced him and he had married the girl and prospered $ethan_frome$ had seen the couple the summer before at shadd falls where they had come to visit relatives
they had a little girl with fair curls who wore a gold locket and was dressed like a princess the deserted wife had not done badly either
her husband had given her the farm and she had managed to sell it and with that and the alimony she had started a lunch room at bettsbridge and bloomed into activity and importance
$ethan_frome$ was fired by the thought why should he not leave with $mattie_silver$ the next day instead of letting her go alone
he would hide his valise under the seat of the sleigh and $zeena$ would suspect nothing till she went upstairs for her afternoon nap and found a letter on the bed
his impulses were still near the surface and he sprang up re lit the lantern and sat down at the table he rummaged in the drawer for a sheet of paper found one and began to write
$zeena$ i ve done all i could for you and i dont see as it been any use i dont blame you nor i dont blame myself
maybe both of us will do better separate i going to try my luck west and you can sell the farm and mill and keep the money
his pen paused on the #word# which brought home to him the relentless conditions of his lot if he gave the farm and mill to $zeena$ what would be left him to start his own life with
once in the west he was sure of picking up work he would not have feared to try his chance alone but with $mattie_silver$ depending on him the case was different
farm and mill were mortgaged to the limit of their value and even if she found a purchaser in itself an unlikely chance it was doubtful if she could clear a thousand dollars on the sale
it was only by incessant labour and personal supervision that $ethan_frome$ drew a meagre living from his land and his wife even if she were in better health than she imagined could never carry such a burden alone
and what of $zeena$ fate meanwhile how could she keep the farm going well she could go back to her people then and see what they would do for her
by the #time# she had discovered his whereabouts and brought suit for divorce he would probably wherever he was be earning enough to pay her a sufficient alimony
it was the fate she was forcing on $mattie_silver$ why not let her try it herself and the alternative was to let $mattie_silver$ go forth alone with far less hope of ultimate provision
he had scattered the contents of the table drawer in his search for a sheet of paper and as he took up his pen his #eye# fell on an old copy of the bettsbridge eagle
he drew the lantern nearer and eagerly scanned the fares then the paper fell from his #hand# and he pushed aside his unfinished letter
a moment ago he had wondered what he and $mattie_silver$ were to live on when they reached the west now he saw that he had not even the money to take her there
borrowing was out of the question six months before he had given his only security to raise funds for necessary repairs to the mill and he knew that without security no one at $starkfield$ would lend him ten dollars
the advertising sheet was folded uppermost and he read the seductive #word# trips to the west reduced rates the inexorable facts closed in on him like prison warders handcuffing a convict
there was no way out none he was a prisoner for life and now his one ray of #light# was to be extinguished
he crept back heavily to the sofa stretching himself out with limbs so leaden that he felt as if they would never move again
as he lay there the window pane that faced him growing gradually lighter inlaid upon the darkness a square of moon suffused sky
a crooked tree branch crossed it a branch of the apple tree under which on summer evenings he had sometimes found $mattie_silver$ sitting when he came up from the mill
tears rose in his throat and slowly burned their way to his lids slowly the rim of the rainy vapours caught fire and burnt away and a pure moon swung into the blue
this was the #night# on which he was to have taken $mattie_silver$ coasting and there hung the lamp to #light# them
he looked out at the slopes bathed in lustre the silver edged darkness of the woods the spectral purple of the hills against the sky and it seemed as though all the beauty of the #night# had been poured out to mock his wretchedness
$ethan_frome$ rising on his elbow watched the landscape whiten and shape itself under the sculpture of the moon he fell asleep and when he woke the chill of the winter dawn was in the room
he felt cold and stiff and hungry and ashamed of being hungry he rubbed his #eye# and went to the window
a red sun stood over the grey rim of the fields behind trees that looked black and brittle he said to himself this is $matt$ last day and tried to think what the place would be without her
as he stood there he heard a step behind him and she entered oh $ethan_frome$ were you here all #night#
she looked so small and pinched in her poor dress with the red scarf wound about her and the cold #light# turning her paleness sallow that $ethan_frome$ stood before her without speaking
you must be frozen she went on fixing lustreless #eye# on him he drew a step nearer how did you know i was here
because i heard you go down stairs again after i went to bed and i listened all #night# and you didnt come up
all his tenderness rushed to his lips he looked at her and said i ll come right along and make up the kitchen fire
they went back to the kitchen and he fetched the coal and kindlings and cleared out the stove for her while she brought in the milk and the cold remains of the meat pie
when warmth began to radiate from the stove and the first ray of sunlight lay on the kitchen floor $ethan_frome$ dark thoughts melted in the mellower air
the sight of $mattie_silver$ going about her work as he had seen her on so many mornings made it seem impossible that she should ever cease to be a part of the scene
he said to himself that he had doubtless exaggerated the significance of $zeena$ threats and that she too with the return of daylight would come to a saner mood
he went up to $mattie_silver$ as she bent above the stove and laid his #hand# on her arm i dont want you should trouble either he said looking down into her #eye# with a smile
she flushed up warmly and whispered back no $ethan_frome$ i aint going to trouble i guess things ll straighten out he added
there was no answer but a quick throb of her lids and he went on she aint said anything this morning
no i havent seen her yet dont you take any notice when you do with this injunction he left her and went out to the cow barn
he saw $jotham_powell$ walking up the hill through the morning mist and the familiar sight added to his growing conviction of security
as the two men were clearing out the stalls $jotham_powell$ rested on his pitch fork to say dan byrne goin over to the flats to day noon an he d take $mattie_silver$ trunk along and make it easier ridin when i take her over in the sleigh
$ethan_frome$ looked at him blankly and he continued mis $ethan_frome$ said the new girl be at the flats at five and i was to take $mattie_silver$ then so st she could ketch the six clock train for stamford
he had to wait a moment before he could find voice to say oh it aint so sure about $mattie_silver$ going
$ethan_frome$ felt the blood drumming in his temples that so said $jotham_powell$ indifferently and they went on with their work
when they returned to the kitchen the two women were already at breakfast $zeena$ had an air of unusual alertness and activity
she drank two cups of coffee and fed the cat with the scraps left in the pie dish then she rose from her seat and walking over to the window snipped two or three yellow leaves from the geraniums
aunt martha aint got a faded leaf on em but they pine away when they aint cared for she said reflectively
then she turned to $jotham_powell$ and asked what #time# you say dan byrne be along the hired man threw a hesitating glance at $ethan_frome$
that trunk of yours is too heavy for the sleigh and dan byrne ll be round to take it over to the flats she said
round about noon he said $zeena$ turned to $mattie_silver$ i much obliged to you $zeena$ said $mattie_silver$
i know there a huckabuck towel missing and i cant make out what you done with that match safet used to stand behind the stuffed owl in the parlour
i like to go over things with you first $zeena$ continued in an unperturbed voice she went out followed by $mattie_silver$ and when the men were alone
$ethan_frome$ finished his usual morning tasks about the house and barn then he said to $jotham_powell$ i going down to $starkfield$
$jotham_powell$ said to his employer i guess i better let dan come round then tell them not to wait dinner
that which had seemed incredible in the sober #light# of day had really come to pass and he was to assist as a helpless spectator at $mattie_silver$ banishment
his manhood was humbled by the part he was compelled to play and by the thought of what $mattie_silver$ must think of him
the passion of rebellion had broken out in him again confused impulses struggled in him as he strode along to the village
he had made up his mind to do something but he did not know what it would be the early mist had vanished and the fields lay like a silver shield under the sun
every yard of the road was alive with $mattie_silver$ presence and there was hardly a branch against the sky or a tangle of brambles on the bank in which some bright shred of memory was not caught
once in the stillness the call of a bird in a mountain ash was so like her laughter that his heart tightened and then grew large and all these things made him see that something must be done at once
suddenly it occurred to him that andrew $mrs_ned_hale$ who was a kind hearted man might be induced to reconsider his refusal and advance a small sum on the lumber if he were told that $zeena$ ill health made it necessary to hire a servant
$mrs_ned_hale$ after all knew enough of $ethan_frome$ situation to make it possible for the latter to renew his appeal without too much loss of pride and moreover how much did pride count in the ebullition of passions in his breast
it was one of the days when the glitter of winter shines through a pale haze of spring the more he considered his plan the more hopeful it seemed
if he could get $mrs_ned_hale$ ear he felt certain of success and with fifty dollars in his pocket nothing could keep him from $mattie_silver$
his first object was to reach $starkfield$ before $mrs_ned_hale$ had started for his work he knew the carpenter had a job down the corbury road and was likely to leave his house early
$ethan_frome$ long strides grew more rapid with the accelerated beat of his thoughts and as he reached the foot of school house hill he caught sight of $mrs_ned_hale$ sleigh in the distance
he hurried forward to meet it but as it drew nearer he saw that it was driven by the carpenter youngest boy and that the figure at his side looking like a large upright cocoon in spectacles was that of $mrs_ned_hale$
$ethan_frome$ signed to them to stop and $mrs_ned_hale$ leaned forward her pink wrinkles twinkling with benevolence mr $mrs_ned_hale$ why yes you ll find him down home now
he woke up with a touch lumbago and i just made him put on one of old dr kidder plasters and set right up into the fire
beaming maternally on $ethan_frome$ she bent over to add i on just heard from mr $mrs_ned_hale$ bout $zeena$ going over to bettsbridge to see that new doctor
he aint going to his work this forenoon i real sorry she feeling so bad again i hope he thinks he can do something for her
i always tell mr $mrs_ned_hale$ i dont know what she a done if she hadnt a had you to look after her and i used to say the same thing bout your mother
she gave him a last nod of sympathy while her son chirped to the horse and $ethan_frome$ as she drove off stood in the middle of the road and stared after the retreating sleigh
i dont know anybody round here had more sickness than $zeena$ you ve had an awful mean #time# $ethan_frome$ it was a long #time# since any one had spoken to him as kindly as $mrs_ned_hale$
most people were either indifferent to his troubles or disposed to think it natural that a young fellow of his age should have carried without repining the burden of three crippled lives
but $mrs_ned_hale$ had said you ve had an awful mean #time# $ethan_frome$ and he felt less alone with his misery
he started down the road toward their house but at the end of a few yards he pulled up sharply the blood in his face
for the first #time# in the #light# of the #word# he had just heard he saw what he was about to do
if the hales were sorry for him they would surely respond to his appeal he was planning to take advantage of the hales sympathy to obtain money from them on false pretences
with the sudden perception of the point to which his madness had carried him the madness fell and he saw his life before him as it was
he was a poor man the husband of a sickly woman whom his desertion would leave alone and destitute and even if he had had the heart to desert her he could have done so only by deceiving two kindly people who had pitied him
that was a plain statement of the cloudy purpose which had driven him in headlong to $starkfield$ he turned and walked slowly back to the farm
at the kitchen door daniel byrne sat in his sleigh behind a big boned grey who pawed the snow and swung his long #head# restlessly from side to side
her #head# was wrapped in her shawl and she was reading a book called kidney troubles and their cure on which he had had to pay extra postage only a few days before
ix $ethan_frome$ went into the kitchen and found his wife by the stove $zeena$ did not move or look up when he entered and after a moment he asked where $mattie_silver$
without lifting her #eye# from the page she replied i presume she getting down her trunk the blood rushed to his face
getting down her trunk alone $jotham_powell$ down in the wood lot and dan byrne says he darsnt leave that horse she returned
her husband without stopping to hear the end of the phrase had left the kitchen and sprung up the stairs the door of $mattie_silver$ room was shut and he wavered a moment on the landing
$matt$ he said in a low voice but there was no answer and he put his #hand# on the door knob
he had never been in her room except once in the early summer when he had gone there to plaster up a leak in the eaves but he remembered exactly how everything had looked
the red and white quilt on her narrow bed the pretty pin cushion on the chest of drawers and over it the enlarged photograph of her mother in an oxydized frame with a bunch of dyed grasses at the back
now these and all other tokens of her presence had vanished and the room looked as bare and comfortless as when $zeena$ had shown her into it on the day of her arrival
in the middle of the floor stood her trunk and on the trunk she sat in her sunday dress her back turned to the door and her face in her #hand#
she had not heard $ethan_frome$ call because she was sobbing and she did not hear his step till he stood close behind her and laid his #hand# on her shoulders
$matt$ oh dont oh $matt$ she started up lifting her wet face to his $ethan_frome$ i thought i wasnt ever going to see you again
he took her in his arms pressing her close and with a trembling #hand# smoothed away the hair from her forehead
not see me again what do you mean she sobbed out $jotham_powell$ said you told him we wasnt to wait dinner for you and i thought
she clung to him without answering and he laid his lips on her hair which was soft yet springy like certain mosses on warm slopes and had the faint woody fragrance of fresh sawdust in the sun
through the door they heard $zeena$ voice calling out from below dan byrne says you better hurry up if you want him to take that trunk
you thought i meant to cut it he finished for her grimly they drew apart with stricken faces
#word# of resistance rushed to $ethan_frome$ lips and died there $mattie_silver$ found her handkerchief and dried her #eye# then bending down she took hold of a handle of the trunk
she answered it takes two to coax it round the corner and submitting to this argument he grasped the other handle and together they manoeuvred the heavy trunk out to the landing
now let go he repeated then he shouldered the trunk and carried it down the stairs and across the passage to the kitchen
$zeena$ who had gone back to her seat by the stove did not lift her #head# from her book as he passed
$ethan_frome$ put her aside you let go $matt$ he ordered her $mattie_silver$ followed him out of the door and helped him to lift the trunk into the back of the sleigh
when it was in place they stood side by side on the door step watching daniel byrne plunge off behind his fidgety horse
it seemed to $ethan_frome$ that his heart was bound with cords which an unseen #hand# was tightening with every tick of the clock
twice he opened his lips to speak to $mattie_silver$ and found no breath at length as she turned to re enter the house he laid a detaining #hand# on her
i going to drive you over $matt$ he whispered she murmured back i think $zeena$ wants i should go with $jotham_powell$
i going to drive you over he repeated and she went into the kitchen without answering at dinner $ethan_frome$ could not eat
if he lifted his #eye# they rested on $zeena$ pinched face and the corners of her straight lips seemed to quiver away into a smile
she ate well declaring that the mild weather made her feel better and pressed a second helping of beans on $jotham_powell$ whose wants she generally ignored
$zeena$ after feeding the cat had returned to her rocking chair by the stove and $jotham_powell$ who always lingered last reluctantly pushed back his chair and moved toward the door
$mattie_silver$ when the meal was over went about her usual task of clearing the table and washing up the dishes on the threshold he turned back to say to $ethan_frome$ what #time# ll
i come round for $mattie_silver$ $ethan_frome$ was standing near the window mechanically filling his pipe while he watched $mattie_silver$ move to and fro
he answered you neednt come round i going to drive her over myself he saw the rise of the colour in $mattie_silver$ averted cheek and the quick lifting of $zeena$ #head#
i want you should stay here this afternoon $ethan_frome$ his wife said $jotham_powell$ can drive $mattie_silver$ over $mattie_silver$ flung an imploring glance at him but he repeated curtly i going to drive her over myself
$zeena$ continued in the same even tone i wanted you should stay and fix up that stove in $mattie_silver$ room afore the girl gets here
it aint been drawing right for nigh on a month now $ethan_frome$ voice rose indignantly if it was good enough for $mattie_silver$
that girl that coming told me she was used to a house where they had a furnace $zeena$ persisted with the same monotonous mildness
she better ha stayed there then he flung back at her and turning to $mattie_silver$ he added in a hard voice you be ready by three $matt$ i ve got business at corbury
i guess it good enough for a hired girl $jotham_powell$ had started for the barn and $ethan_frome$ strode down after him aflame with anger
the pulses in his temples throbbed and a fog was in his #eye# he went about his task without knowing what force directed him or whose #hand# and feet were fulfilling its orders
it was not till he led out the sorrel and backed him between the shafts of the sleigh that he once more became conscious of what he was doing
as he passed the bridle over the horse #head# and wound the traces around the shafts he remembered the day when he had made the same preparations in order to drive over and meet his wife cousin at the flats
it was little more than a year ago on just such a soft afternoon with a feel of spring in the air
the sorrel turning the same big ringed #eye# on him nuzzled the palm of his #hand# in the same way and one by one all the days between rose up and stood before him
he flung the bearskin into the sleigh climbed to the seat and drove up to the house when he entered the kitchen it was empty but $mattie_silver$ bag and shawl lay ready by the door
no sound reached him from above but presently he thought he heard some one moving about in his deserted study and pushing open the door he saw $mattie_silver$ in her hat and jacket standing with her back to him near the table
he went to the foot of the stairs and listened she started at his approach and turning quickly said is it #time#
what are you doing here $matt$ he asked her she looked at him timidly i was just taking a look round that all she answered with a wavering smile
they went back into the kitchen without speaking and $ethan_frome$ picked up her bag and shawl where $zeena$ he asked
she went upstairs right after dinner she said she had those shooting pains again and didnt want to be disturbed
$ethan_frome$ looking slowly about the kitchen said to himself with a shudder that in a few #hour# he would be returning to it alone
then the sense of unreality overcame him once more and he could not bring himself to believe that $mattie_silver$ stood there for the last #time# before him
didnt she say good bye to you no that was all she said come on he said almost gaily opening the door and putting her bag into the sleigh
he sprang to his seat and bent over to tuck the rug about her as she slipped into the place at his side
now then go long he said with a shake of the reins that sent the sorrel placidly jogging down the hill
we got lots of #time# for a good ride $matt$ he cried seeking her #hand# beneath the fur and pressing it in his
his face tingled and he felt dizzy as if he had stopped in at the $starkfield$ saloon on a zero day for a drink
$mattie_silver$ sat silent giving no sign of surprise but after a moment she said are you going round by shadow pond
at the gate instead of making for $starkfield$ he turned the sorrel to the right up the bettsbridge road he laughed and answered i knew you know
she drew closer under the bearskin so that looking sideways around his coat sleeve he could just catch the tip of her nose and a blown brown wave of hair
they drove slowly up the road between fields glistening under the pale sun and then bent to the right down a lane edged with spruce and larch
ahead of them a long way off a range of hills stained by mottlings of black forest flowed away in round white curves against the sky
as they entered it the breeze fell and a warm stillness seemed to drop from the branches with the dropping needles
here the snow was so pure that the tiny tracks of wood animals had left on it intricate lace like patterns and the bluish cones caught in its surface stood out like ornaments of bronze
$ethan_frome$ drove on in silence till they reached a part of the wood where the pines were more widely spaced then he drew up and helped $mattie_silver$ to get out of the sleigh
they passed between the aromatic trunks the snow breaking crisply under their feet till they came to a small sheet of water with steep wooded sides
across its frozen surface from the farther bank a single hill rising against the western sun threw the long conical shadow which gave the lake its name
the lane passed into a pine wood with boles reddening in the afternoon sun and delicate blue shadows on the snow it was a shy secret spot full of the same dumb melancholy that $ethan_frome$ felt in his heart
he looked up and down the little pebbly beach till his #eye# lit on a fallen tree trunk half submerged in snow
the entertainment of which he spoke was one of the few that they had taken part in together a church picnic which on a long afternoon of the preceding summer had filled the retired place with merry making
there where we sat at the picnic he reminded her $mattie_silver$ had begged him to go with her but he had refused
then toward sunset coming down from the mountain where he had been felling timber he had been caught by some strayed revellers and drawn into the group by the lake where $mattie_silver$ encircled by facetious youths and bright as a blackberry under her spreading hat was brewing coffee over a gipsy fire
he remembered the shyness he had felt at approaching her in his uncouth clothes and then the lighting up of her face and the way she had broken through the group to come to him with a cup in her #hand#
they had sat for a few minutes on the fallen log by the pond and she had missed her gold locket and set the young men searching for it and it was $ethan_frome$ who had spied it in the moss
that was all but all their intercourse had been made up of just such inarticulate flashes when they seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a butterfly in the winter woods
it was right there i found your locket he said pushing his foot into a dense tuft of blueberry bushes
i never saw anybody with such sharp #eye# she answered she sat down on the tree trunk in the sun and he sat down beside her
you were as pretty as a picture in that pink hat he said she laughed with pleasure oh i guess it was the hat
they had never before avowed their inclination so openly and $ethan_frome$ for a moment had the illusion that he was a free man wooing the girl he meant to marry
he looked at her hair and longed to touch it again and to tell her that it smelt of the woods but he had never learned to say such things
she rejoined suddenly she rose to her feet and said we mustnt stay here any longer he continued to gaze at her vaguely only half roused from his dream
they stood looking at each other as if the #eye# of each were straining to absorb and hold fast the other image
there were things he had to say to her before they parted but he could not say them in that place of summer memories and he turned and followed her in silence to the sleigh
there plenty of #time# he answered as they drove away the sun sank behind the hill and the pine boles turned from red to grey
by a devious track between the fields they wound back to the $starkfield$ road under the open sky the #light# was still clear with a reflection of cold red on the eastern hills
the clumps of trees in the snow seemed to draw together in ruffled lumps like birds with their #head# under their wings and the sky as it paled rose higher leaving the earth more alone
as they turned into the $starkfield$ road $ethan_frome$ said $matt$ what do you mean to do she did not answer at once but at length she said i ll try to get a place in a store
you know you cant do it the bad air and the standing all day nearly killed you before i a lot stronger than i was before i came to $starkfield$
and now you re going to throw away all the good it done you there seemed to be no answer to this and again they drove on for a while without speaking
with every yard of the way some spot where they had stood and laughed together or been silent clutched at $ethan_frome$ and dragged him back
isnt there any of your father folks could help you there isnt any of em i ask he lowered his voice to say you know there nothing i wouldnt do for you if i could
i know there isnt but i cant she was silent but he felt a slight tremor in the shoulder against his
oh $matt$ he broke out if i could ha gone with you now i ha done it she turned to him pulling a scrap of paper from her breast
even in the failing #light# he saw it was the letter to his wife that he had begun the #night# before and forgotten to destroy
$ethan_frome$ i found this she stammered through his astonishment there ran a fierce thrill of joy $matt$ he cried if i could ha done it would you
oh $ethan_frome$ ethan what the use with a sudden movement she tore the letter in shreds and sent them fluttering off into the snow
she was silent for a moment then she said in such a low tone that he had to stoop his #head# to hear her i used to think of it sometimes summer #night# when the moon was so bright
tell me $matt$ tell me he adjured her i couldnt sleep his heart reeled with the sweetness of it
as long ago as that she answered as if the date had long been fixed for her the first #time# was at shadow pond
i was dreadfully put out when you wouldnt go to the picnic with me and then when i saw you coming down the road i thought maybe you gone home that way
was that why you gave me my coffee before the others i dont know did i purpose and that made me glad
they had reached the point where the road dipped to the hollow by $ethan_frome$ mill and as they descended the darkness descended with them dropping down like a black veil from the heavy hemlock boughs
they were silent again i tied #hand# and foot $matt$ there isnt a thing i can do he began again
you must write to me sometimes $ethan_frome$ oh what good ll writing do i want to put my #hand# out and touch you
i want to do for you and care for you i want to be there when you re sick and when you re lonesome
you mustnt think but what i ll do all right you wont need me you mean i suppose you ll marry oh $ethan_frome$
she cried i dont know how it is you make me feel $matt$ i a most rather have you dead than that
oh i wish i was i wish i was she sobbed the sound of her weeping shook him out of his dark anger and he felt ashamed
dont let talk that way he whispered why shouldnt we when it true i ve been wishing it every minute of the day
$matt$ you be quiet dont you say it there never anybody been good to me but you dont say that either when i cant lift a #hand# for you
yes but it true just the same they had reached the top of school house hill and $starkfield$ lay below them in the twilight
a cutter mounting the road from the village passed them by in a joyous flutter of bells and they straightened themselves and looked ahead with rigid faces
along the main street #light# had begun to shine from the house fronts and stray figures were turning in here and there at the gates
as they drew near the end of the village the cries of children reached them and they saw a knot of boys with sleds behind them scattering across the open space before the church
$ethan_frome$ with a touch of his whip roused the sorrel to a languid trot i guess this ll be their last coast for a day or two $ethan_frome$ said looking up at the mild sky
still she did not speak and prompted by an obscure desire to help himself and her through their miserable last #hour# he went on discursively
$mattie_silver$ was silent and he added we were to have gone down last #night# aint it funny we havent been down together but just that once last winter
they had reached the crest of the corbury road and between the indistinct white glimmer of the church and the black curtain of the varnum spruces the slope stretched away below them without a sled on its length
she answered it wasnt often i got down to the village that so he said some erratic impulse prompted $ethan_frome$ to say how you like me to take you down now
she forced a laugh why there isnt #time# there all the #time# we want come along his one desire now was to postpone the moment of turning the sorrel toward the flats
but the girl she faltered the girl ll be waiting at the station well let her wait you have to if she didnt
the note of authority in his voice seemed to subdue her and when he had jumped from the sleigh she let him help her out saying only with a vague feint of reluctance
come but there isnt a sled round anywheres yes there is right over there under the spruces he threw the bearskin over the sorrel who stood passively by the roadside hanging a meditative #head#
then he caught $mattie_silver$ #hand# and drew her after him toward the sled she seated herself obediently and he took his place behind her so close that her hair brushed his face
all right $matt$ he called out as if the width of the road had been between them she turned her #head# to say it dreadfully dark
he laughed contemptuously i could go down this coast with my #eye# tied and she laughed with him as if she liked his audacity
nevertheless he sat still a moment straining his #eye# down the long hill for it was the most confusing #hour# of the evening
the #hour# when the last clearness from the upper sky is merged with the rising #night# in a blur that disguises landmarks and falsifies distances
the sled started with a bound and they flew on through the dusk gathering smoothness and speed as they went with the hollow #night# opening out below them and the air singing by like an organ
$mattie_silver$ sat perfectly still but as they reached the bend at the foot of the hill where the big elm thrust out a deadly elbow he fancied that she shrank a little closer
he cried exultantly as they spun safely past it and flew down the second slope and when they reached the level ground beyond and the speed of the sled began to slacken he heard her give a little laugh of glee
are you sure you can see now he cried dont be scared $matt$ they sprang off and started to walk back up the hill
$ethan_frome$ dragged the sled with one #hand# and passed the other through $mattie_silver$ arm were you scared i run you into the elm
he asked with a boyish laugh i told you i was never scared with you she answered the strange exaltation of his mood had brought on one of his rare fits of boastfulness
it is a tricky place though the least swerve and we never ha come up again but i can measure distances to a hair breadth always could
deep silence had fallen with the starless dusk and they leaned on each other without speaking but at every step of their climb $ethan_frome$ said to himself it the last #time# we ll ever walk together
she murmured i always say you ve got the surest #eye# they mounted slowly to the top of the hill
when they were abreast of the church he stooped his #head# to her to ask are you tired and she answered breathing quickly it was splendid
with a pressure of his arm he guided her toward the norway spruces i guess this sled must be $mrs_ned_hale$
anyhow i ll leave it where i found it he drew the sled up to the varnum gate and rested it against the fence
as he raised himself he suddenly felt $mattie_silver$ close to him among the shadows is this where $mrs_ned_hale$ and ruth kissed each other
she whispered breathlessly and flung her arms about him her lips groping for his swept over his face and he held her fast in a rapture of surprise
good bye good bye she stammered and kissed him again oh $matt$ i cant let you go broke from him in the same old cry
she freed herself from his hold and he heard her sobbing oh i cant go either she wailed $matt$
what ll we do what ll we do they clung to each other #hand# like children and her body shook with desperate sobs
through the stillness they heard the church clock striking five oh $ethan_frome$ it #time# she cried he drew her back to him
#time# for what you dont suppose i going to leave you now if i missed my train where i go
where are you going if you catch it she stood silent her #hand# lying cold and relaxed in his
what the good of either of us going anywheres without the other one now he said she remained motionless as if she had not heard him
then she snatched her #hand# from his threw her arms about his neck and pressed a sudden drenched cheek against his face
$ethan_frome$ ethan i want you to take me down again down where the coast right off she panted
sot we ll never come up any more $matt$ what on earth do you mean she put her lips close against his ear to say
right into the big elm you said you could sot we never have to leave each other any more why what are you talking of
you re crazy i not crazy but i will be if i leave you oh $matt$ matt he groaned she tightened her fierce hold about his neck
her face lay close to his face $ethan_frome$ where ll i go if i leave you i dont know how to get along alone
and there ll be that strange girl in the house and she ll sleep in my bed where i used to lay #night# and listen to hear you come up the stairs
you said so yourself just now nobody but you was ever good to me the #word# were like fragments torn from his heart
with them came the hated vision of the house he was going back to of the stairs he would have to go up every #night# of the woman who would wait for him there
and the sweetness of $mattie_silver$ avowal the wild wonder of knowing at last that all that had happened to him had happened to her too made the other vision more abhorrent the other life more intolerable to return to
her pleadings still came to him between short sobs but he no longer heard what she was saying her hat had slipped back and he was stroking her hair
he wanted to get the feeling of it into his #hand# so that it would sleep there like a seed in winter
but his cheek touched hers and it was cold and full of weeping and he saw the road to the flats under the #night# and heard the whistle of the train up the #line#
once he found her mouth again and they seemed to be by the pond together in the burning august sun the spruces swathed them in blackness and silence
they might have been in their coffins underground he said to himself perhaps it ll feel like this and then again after this i sha nt feel anything
suddenly he heard the old sorrel whinny across the road and thought he wondering why he doesnt get his supper
he pulled the sled out blinking like a #night# bird as he passed from the shade of the spruces into the transparent dusk of the open
come $mattie_silver$ whispered tugging at his #hand# her sombre violence constrained him she seemed the embodied instrument of fate the slope below them was deserted
all $starkfield$ was at supper and not a figure crossed the open space before the church the sky swollen with the clouds that announce a thaw hung as low as before a summer storm
he strained his #eye# through the dimness and they seemed less keen less capable than usual he took his seat on the sled and $mattie_silver$ instantly placed herself in front of him
he stretched out his legs drove his heels into the road to keep the sled from slipping forward and bent her #head# back between his #hand#
her hat had fallen into the snow and his lips were in her hair then suddenly he sprang up again get up he ordered her
it was the tone she always heeded but she cowered down in her seat repeating vehemently no no no get up
why i want to sit in front no no how can you steer in front i dont have to we ll follow the track
they spoke in smothered whispers as though the #night# were listening get up get up he urged her but she kept on repeating why do you want to sit in front
because i because i want to feel you holding me he stammered and dragged her to her feet the answer seemed to satisfy her or else she yielded to the power of his voice
he bent down feeling in the obscurity for the glassy slide worn by preceding coasters and placed the runners carefully between its edges
she waited while he seated himself with crossed legs in the front of the sled then she crouched quickly down at his back and clasped her arms about him
her breath in his neck set him shuddering again and he almost sprang from his seat but in a flash he remembered the alternative
just as they started he heard the sorrel whinny again and the familiar wistful call and all the confused images it brought with it went with him down the first reach of the road
she was right this was better than parting he leaned back and drew her mouth to his half way down there was a sudden drop then a rise and after that another long delirious descent
as they took wing for this it seemed to him that they were flying indeed flying far up into the cloudy #night# with $starkfield$ immeasurably below them falling away like a speck in space
then the big elm shot up ahead lying in wait for them at the bend of the road and he said between his teeth we can fetch it i know we can fetch it as they flew toward the tree $mattie_silver$ pressed her arms tighter and her blood seemed to be in his veins
he slanted his body to keep it headed for the elm repeating to himself again and again i know we can fetch it and little phrases she had spoken ran through his #head# and danced before him on the air
the big tree loomed bigger and closer and as they bore down on it he thought it waiting for us it seems to know
but suddenly his wife face with twisted monstrous lineaments thrust itself between him and his goal and he made an instinctive movement to brush it aside
the sled swerved in response but he righted it again kept it straight and drove down on the black projecting mass
once or twice the sled swerved a little under them there was a last instant when the air shot past him like millions of fiery wires and then the elm
the sky was still thick but looking straight up he saw a single star and tried vaguely to reckon whether it were sirius or or the effort tired him too much and he closed his heavy lids and thought that he would sleep
the stillness was so profound that he heard a little animal twittering somewhere near by under the snow it made a small frightened cheep like a field mouse and he wondered languidly if it were hurt
then he understood that it must be in pain pain so excruciating that he seemed mysteriously to feel it shooting through his own body
he tried in vain to roll over in the direction of the sound and stretched his left arm out across the snow
and now it was as though he felt rather than heard the twittering it seemed to be under his palm which rested on something soft and springy
the thought of the animal suffering was intolerable to him and he struggled to raise himself and could not because a rock or some huge mass seemed to be lying on him
but he continued to finger about cautiously with his left #hand# thinking he might get hold of the little creature and help it and all at once he knew that the soft thing he had touched was $mattie_silver$ hair and that his #hand# was on her face
he dragged himself to his knees the monstrous load on him moving with him as he moved and his #hand# went over and over her face and he felt that the twittering came from her lips
he got his face down close to hers with his ear to her mouth and in the darkness he saw her #eye# open and heard her say his name
oh $matt$ i thought we fetched it he moaned and far off up the hill he heard the sorrel whinny and thought i ought to be getting him his feed
the querulous drone ceased as i entered $ethan_frome$ kitchen and of the two women sitting there i could not tell which had been the speaker
one of them on my appearing raised her tall bony figure from her seat not as if to welcome me for she threw me no more than a brief glance of surprise but simply to set about preparing the meal which $ethan_frome$ absence had delayed
a slatternly calico wrapper hung from her shoulders and the wisps of her thin grey hair were drawn away from a high forehead and fastened at the back by a broken comb
she had pale opaque #eye# which revealed nothing and reflected nothing and her narrow lips were of the same sallow colour as her face
she sat huddled in an arm chair near the stove and when i came in she turned her #head# quickly toward me without the least corresponding movement of her body
her hair was as grey as her companion her face as bloodless and shrivelled but amber tinted with swarthy shadows sharpening the nose and hollowing the temples
under her shapeless dress her body kept its limp immobility and her dark #eye# had the bright witch like stare that disease of the spine sometimes gives
the other woman was much smaller and slighter even for that part of the country the kitchen was a poor looking place
with the exception of the dark eyed woman chair which looked like a soiled relic of luxury bought at a country auction the furniture was of the roughest kind
three coarse china plates and a broken nosed milk jug had been set on a greasy table scored with knife cuts and a couple of straw bottomed chairs and a kitchen dresser of unpainted pine stood meagrely against the plaster walls
my it cold here the fire must be most out $ethan_frome$ said glancing about him apologetically as he followed me in
the tall woman who had moved away from us toward the dresser took no notice but the other from her cushioned niche answered complainingly in a high thin voice
$zeena$ fell asleep and slep ever so long and i thought i be frozen stiff before i could wake her up and get her to tend to it
it on just been made up this very minute i knew then that it was she who had been speaking when we entered
her companion who was just coming back to the table with the remains of a cold mince pie in a battered pie dish set down her unappetising burden without appearing to hear the accusation brought against her
$ethan_frome$ stood hesitatingly before her as she advanced then he looked at me and said this is my wife mis $ethan_frome$
after another interval he added turning toward the figure in the arm chair and this is miss $mattie_silver$
$mrs_ned_hale$ tender soul had pictured me as lost in the flats and buried under a snow drift and so lively was her satisfaction on seeing me safely restored to her the next morning that i felt my peril had caused me to advance several degrees in her favour
great was her amazement and that of old mrs varnum on learning that $ethan_frome$ old horse had carried me to and from corbury junction through the worst blizzard of the winter greater still their surprise when they heard that his master had taken me in for the #night#
beneath their wondering exclamations i felt a secret curiosity to know what impressions i had received from my #night# in the $ethan_frome$ household and divined that the best way of breaking down their reserve was to let them try to penetrate mine
i therefore confined myself to saying in a matter of fact tone that i had been received with great kindness and that $ethan_frome$ had made a bed for me in a room on the ground floor which seemed in happier days to have been fitted up as a kind of writing room or study
well $mrs_ned_hale$ mused in such a storm i suppose he felt he couldnt do less than take you in
but i guess it went hard with $ethan_frome$ i dont believe but what you re the only stranger has set foot in that house for over twenty years
he that proud he dont even like his oldest friends to go there and i dont know as any do any more except myself and the doctor
i used to go a good deal after the accident when i was first married but after awhile i got to think it made em feel worse to see us
you still go there $mrs_ned_hale$ i ventured and then one thing and another came and my own troubles
but i generally make out to drive over there round about new year and once in the summer only i always try to pick a day when $ethan_frome$ off somewheres
it bad enough to see the two women sitting there but his face when he looks round that bare place just kills me
you see i can look back and call it up in his mother day before their troubles old mrs varnum by this #time# had gone up to bed and her daughter
$mrs_ned_hale$ glanced at me tentatively as though trying to see how much footing my conjectures gave her and i guessed that if she had kept silence till now it was because she had been waiting through all the years for some one who should see what she alone had seen
i waited to let her trust in me gather strength before i said yes it pretty bad seeing all three of them there together
and i were sitting alone after supper in the austere seclusion of the horse hair parlour she drew her mild brows into a frown of pain
it was just awful from the beginning i was here in the house when they were carried up they laid $mattie_silver$ in the room you re in
she and i were great friends and she was to have been my bridesmaid in the spring when she came to i went up to her and stayed all #night#
they gave her things to quiet her and she didnt know much till to rd morning and then all of a sudden she woke up just like herself and looked straight at me out of her big #eye# and said
oh i dont know why i telling you all this $mrs_ned_hale$ broke off crying she took off her spectacles wiped the moisture from them and put them on again with an unsteady #hand#
it got about the next day she went on that $zeena$ $ethan_frome$ had sent $mattie_silver$ off in a hurry because she had a hired girl coming and the folks here could never rightly tell what she and $ethan_frome$ were doing that #night# coasting when they ought to have been on their way to the flats to ketch the train
anyhow when she heard the accident she came right in and stayed with $ethan_frome$ over to the minister where they carried him
and as soon as the doctors said that $mattie_silver$ could be moved $zeena$ sent for her and took her back to the farm
i never knew myself what $zeena$ thought i dont to this day nobody knows $zeena$ thoughts and there she been ever since
$mrs_ned_hale$ answered simply there was nowhere else for her to go and my heart tightened at the thought of the hard compulsions of the poor
yes there she been $mrs_ned_hale$ continued and $zeena$ done for her and done for $ethan_frome$ as good as she could
it was a miracle considering how sick she was but she seemed to be raised right up just when the call came to her
not as she ever given up doctoring and she had sick spells right along but she had the strength given her to care for those two for over twenty years and before the accident came she thought she couldnt even care for herself
$mrs_ned_hale$ paused a moment and i remained silent plunged in the vision of what her #word# evoked
it horrible for them all i murmured yes it pretty bad and they aint any of em easy people either
$mattie_silver$ was before the accident i never knew a sweeter nature but she suffered too much that what i always say when folks tell me how she soured
and $zeena$ she was always cranky not but what she bears with $mattie_silver$ wonderful i ve seen that myself but sometimes the two of them get going at each other and then $ethan_frome$ face break your heart
when i see that i think it him that suffers most anyhow it aint $zeena$ because she aint got the #time#
in the summertime on pleasant days they move $mattie_silver$ into the parlour or out in the door yard and that makes it easier
it a pity though $mrs_ned_hale$ ended sighing that they re all shut up there that one kitchen but winters there the fires to be thought of and there aint a dime to spare up at the fromes
$mrs_ned_hale$ drew a deep breath as though her memory were eased of its long burden and she had no more to say but suddenly an impulse of complete avowal seized her
she took off her spectacles again leaned toward me across the bead work table cover and went on with lowered voice there was one day about a week after the accident when they all thought $mattie_silver$ couldnt live
well i say it a pity she did i said it right out to our minister once and he was shocked at me
only he wasnt with me that morning when she first came to and i say if she ha died $ethan_frome$ might ha lived and
the way they are now i dont see there much difference between the fromes up at the farm and the fromes down in the graveyard cept that down there they re all quiet and the women have got to hold their tongues
