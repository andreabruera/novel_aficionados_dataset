narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ encompasses eleven chapters that recount $frederick_douglass$ life as slave and his ambition to become free man
$frederick_douglass$ begins by explaining that he does not know the date of his birth he later chose february and that his mother died when he was years old
he has very few memories of her children were commonly separated from their mothers only of the rare nighttime visit he thinks his father is white man possibly his owner
$frederick_douglass$ details the cruel interaction that occurs between slaves and slaveholders as well as how slaves are supposed to behave in the presence of their masters and even when $frederick_douglass$ says that fear is what kept many slaves where they were when they tell the truth they are punished by their owners
at very early age he sees his aunt hester being whipped frontispiece of $frederick_douglass$ from the first edition at this #point# in the narrative $frederick_douglass$ is moved to baltimore maryland
this move is rather important for him because he believes that if he had not been moved he would have remained slave his entire life
he even starts to have #hope# for better life in the future he also discusses his new mistress mrs sophia $thomas_auld$ who begins as very kind woman but eventually turns cruel
$frederick_douglass$ learns the alphabet and how to spell small words from this woman but her husband mr $thomas_auld$ disapproves and states that if slaves could read they would not be fit to be slaves being unmanageable and sad
upon hearing why mr $thomas_auld$ disapproves of slaves being taught how to read $frederick_douglass$ realizes the importance of reading and the possibilities that this skill could help him
he takes it upon himself to learn how to read and learn all he can but at times this new found skill torments him
$frederick_douglass$ then gains an understanding of the word abolition and develops the idea to run away to the north he also learns how to write and how to read well
at the age of ten or eleven $frederick_douglass$ master dies and his life to be divided between his son and daughter
the slaves are valued along with the livestock causing $frederick_douglass$ to develop new hatred of slavery he feels lucky when he is sent back to baltimore to live with the family of $master_hugh$
his regret at not having attempted to run away is evident but on his voyage he makes mental note that he traveled in the north easterly direction and considers this information to be of extreme importance
he is then moved through few more situations before he is sent to st michael for some time he lives with master $thomas_auld$ who is particularly cruel even after attending methodist camp
he is pleased when he eventually is lent to $mr_edward_covey$ for year simply because he would be fed $mr_edward_covey$ is known as negro breaker who breaks the will of slaves
while under the control of $mr_edward_covey$ $frederick_douglass$ bites $mr_edward_covey$ hand and has an especially hard time at the tasks required of him
he is harshly whipped almost on weekly basis apparently due to his awkwardness he is worked and beaten to exhaustion which finally causes him to collapse one #day# while working in the fields
because of this he is brutally beaten once more by $mr_edward_covey$ $frederick_douglass$ eventually complains to $thomas_auld$ who subsequently sends him back to $mr_edward_covey$
a few #day# later $mr_edward_covey$ attempts to tie up $frederick_douglass$ but he fights back after two hour long physical battle $frederick_douglass$ ultimately conquers $mr_edward_covey$
$frederick_douglass$ is not punished by the law which is believed to be due to the fact that $mr_edward_covey$ cherishes his reputation as negro breaker which would be jeopardized if others knew what happened
after this fight he is never beaten again when his one year contract ends under $mr_edward_covey$ $frederick_douglass$ is sent to live on $mr_william_hamilton$ freeman plantation
$frederick_douglass$ comments on the abuse suffered under $mr_edward_covey$ religious man and the relative peace under the more favourable but more secular freeman
$frederick_douglass$ and small group of slaves make plan to #escape# but before doing so they are caught and $frederick_douglass$ is put in jail
on freeman plantation $frederick_douglass$ befriends other slaves and teaches them how to read following his release about week later he is sent to baltimore once more but this time to learn trade
he becomes an apprentice in shipyard under $mr_gardner$ where he is disliked by several white apprentices due to his slave status and race at one #point# he gets into fight with them and they nearly gouge out his left eye
woefully beaten $frederick_douglass$ goes to $master_hugh$ who is kind regarding this situation and refuses to let $frederick_douglass$ return to the shipyard
sophia $thomas_auld$ who had turned cruel under the influence of slavery feels pity for $frederick_douglass$ and tends to the wound at his left eye until he is healed
at this #point# $frederick_douglass$ is employed as calker and receives wages but is forced to give every cent to master $thomas_auld$ in due time
$master_hugh$ tries to find lawyer but all refuse saying they can only do something for white person $frederick_douglass$ eventually finds his own job and plans the date in which he will #escape# to the north
he succeeds in reaching new bedford but does not give details of how he does so in order to protect those who helped him and to allow the possibility for other slaves #escape# by similar means

the narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ was published on may and within four months of this publication five thousand copies were sold
after publication he left lynn massachusetts and sailed to england and ireland for two years in fear of being recaptured by his owner in the united states
he eventually escaped slavery and published #book# while in britain and ireland he gained supporters who paid to purchase his emancipation from his legal owner
one of the more significant reasons $frederick_douglass$ published his narrative was to offset the demeaning manner in which white people viewed him
more specifically they did not want him to analyze the current slavery issues or to shape the future for black people
however once narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ was published he was given the liberty to begin more ambitious work on the issue rather than giving the same speeches repetitively
because of the work in his narrative $frederick_douglass$ gained significant credibility from those who previously did not believe the story of his past
while in ireland the dublin edition of the #book# was published by the abolitionist printer richard webb to great acclaim and $frederick_douglass$ would write extensively in later editions very positively about his experience in ireland
when he spoke in public his white abolitionist associates established limits to what he could say on the platform his newfound liberty on the platform eventually led him to start black newspaper against the advice of his fellow abolitionists
the publication of narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ opened several doors not only for $frederick_douglass$ ambitious work but also for the anti slavery movement of that time
narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ received many positive reviews but there was group of people who opposed $frederick_douglass$ work
one of his biggest critics a c thompson was neighbor of $thomas_auld$ who was the master of $frederick_douglass$ for some time
as seen in letter from slave holder by a c thompson found in the norton critical edition of narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ an american slave he claimed that the slave he knew was an unlearned and rather an ordinary negro
he also disputed the narrative when $frederick_douglass$ described the various cruel white slave holders that he either knew or knew of
prior to the publication of narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ the public could not fathom how it was possible for former slave to appear to be so educated
thompson was confident that $frederick_douglass$ was not capable of writing the narrative upon listening to his oratory many were skeptical of the stories he told
also found in the norton critical edition margaret fuller prominent #book# reviewer and literary critic of that era had high regard of $frederick_douglass$ work
after $frederick_douglass$ publication however the public was swayed viewed his text as an affirmation of what he spoke of publicly she claimed we have never read more simple true coherent and warm with genuine feeling
she also suggested that every one may read his #book# and see what mind might have been stifled in bondage what man may be subjected to the insults of spendthrift dandies or the blows of mercenary brutes in whom there is no whiteness except of the skin no humanity in the outward form
the first #chapter# of this text has been mobilized in several major texts that have become foundational texts in contemporary black studies hortense spillers in her article mama baby
papa maybe an american grammar #book# saidiya hartman in her #book# scenes of subjection terror slavery and self making in nineteenth century america and fred moten in his #book#
$frederick_douglass$ work in this narrative was an influential #piece# of literature in the anti slavery movement in the break the aesthetics of the black radical tradition
each author uniquely contends with and navigates through $frederick_douglass$ writing specifically each author has divergent approach to revisiting or reproducing narratives of the suffering enslaved body
these divergences on $frederick_douglass$ are further reflected in their differing explorations of the conditions where subject and object positions of the enslaved body are produced and or troubled
spillers mobilizes $frederick_douglass$ description of his and his siblings early separation from their mother and subsequent estrangement from each other to articulate how the syntax of subjectivity in particular kinship has historically specific relationship to the objectifying formations of chattel slavery which denied genetic links and familial bonds between the enslaved
spillers frames $frederick_douglass$ narrative as writing that although frequently returned to still has the ability to astonish contemporary readers with each return to this scene of enslaved grief and loss spillers mama baby
by tracing the historical conditions of captivity through which slave humanity is defined as absence from subject position narratives like $frederick_douglass$ chronicles of the middle passage and incidents in the life of slave girl are framed as impression points that have not lost their affective potential or become problematically familiar through repetitions or revisions spillers mama baby
spillers own re visitation of $frederick_douglass$ narrative suggests that these efforts are critical component to her assertion that order for me to speak truer word concerning myself must strip down through layers of attenuated meanings made an excess in time over time assigned by particular historical order and there await whatever marvels of my own inventiveness
this denial was part of the processes that worked to reinforce the enslaved position as property and object spillers mama baby
in contrast to spiller articulation that repetition does not rob $frederick_douglass$ narrative of its power saidiya hartman explores how an over familiarity with narratives of the suffering enslaved body is problematic
in hartman work repeated exposure of the violated body is positioned as process that can lead to benumbing indifference to suffering hartman scenes of objection
description of the violence carried out against his aunt hester is contextualized by hartman critical examination of century abolitionist writings in the antebellum south
these abolitionist narratives included extreme representations of violence carried out against the enslaved body which were included to establish the slave humanity and evoke empathy while exposing the terrors of the institution
however hartman posits that these abolitionist efforts which may have intended to convey enslaved subjectivities actually aligned more closely to replications of objectivity since they reinforce the thingly quality of the captive by reducing the body to evidence hartman scenes of subjection
instead of concentrating on these narratives that dramatized violence and the suffering black body hartman is more focused on revealing the quotidian ways that enslaved personhood and objectivity were selectively constructed or brought into tension in scenes like the coffle coerced performances of slave leisure on the plantation and the popular theater of the antebellum south
fred moten engagement with narrative of the life of $frederick_douglass$ echoes spillers assertion that every writing as revision makes the discovery all over again spillers
in his #book# #chapter# resistance of the object aunt hester scream he speaks to hartman move away from aunt hester experience of violence
whether hartman opposition to reproducing this narrative is not actually direct move through relationship between violence and the captive body positioned as object that she had intended to avoid
moten suggests that as hartman outlines the reasons for her opposition her written reference to the narrative and the violence of its content may indeed be an inevitable reproduction
this is reflected in his question of whether performance in general is ever outside the economy of reproduction moten in the break
a key parameter in moten analytical method and the way he engages with hartman work is an exploration of blackness as positional framework through which objectivity and humanity are performed
this suggests that an attempt to move beyond the violence and object position of aunt hester would always be first move through these things
moten revisitation of $frederick_douglass$ narrative explores how the sounds of black performance might trouble conventional understandings of subjectivity and subjective speech
